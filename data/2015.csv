"What If Apple, Google or Amazon Accepted Bitcoin?","Apple

Known for its lineup of Mac computers, the iPhone and iTunes, Apple has been ranked the most valuable brand in the world.

The company is trying to compete with bitcoin through its mobile payments product called Apple Pay.

“Apple would not have as strong of an impact compared to Amazon or Google.”

— David Moon, co-founder of Spelunk.in

Unlike the other two companies here, the likelihood of Apple accepting bitcoin and the subsequent effect it would have might be smaller.

Google

Google makes 95% of its revenue from ads, a business model it knows is unsustainable for the long term.

This is why it has expanded into things like mobile devices, self driving cars and drone-based delivey systems.

“If Google AdSense and YouTube started to pay out in bitcoin, I think that would be very impactful.”

— Valerian Bennett, creator of theprotocol.tv

Google’s interest in digital currencies is high. Its Google Wallet platform hasn’t done well and it invested in digital currency startup Ripple Labs.

Amazon

Amazon is the largest online retailer in the United States. It exerts a lot of influence on the digital economy.

Many consumers buy things regularly via Amazon. Because of this, Amazon’s impact on bitcoin, if it were to accept it, would be gigantic.

“All are great companies, but I buy 20–100x more from Amazon than Google or Apple.”

— Jason Chroman, Enthusiast

Visual thinking and NeuroLeadership,"I was on the phone with a friend and former customer yesterday, who is now a leadership coach, and she asked me if I would connect the dots between our core practice, Visual Thinking, and NeuroLeadership.

“I’m sure there’s a connection because I’ve seen the process, there’s something there,” she said.

Yes, there is absolutely a connection. Thank you Laura, for asking the question and giving me the opportunity to think it through.

What is NeuroLeadership?

NeuroLeadership is a discipline that connects brain science to leadership. Its focus is to apply hard science to solve problems and increase effectiveness in leadership and management. One concept from NeuroLeadership that I have found very helpful is the SCARF model developed by David Rock, author of Your Brain at Work, Quiet Leadership, and Coaching with the Brain in Mind.

Some social needs are as important to the brain as air, food and water. If these social needs are not being met, the brain reacts in the same way as it would if you were literally starving or gasping for air.

SCARF stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness.

Status: People need to feel important, recognized, needed by others.

Certainty: People need to feel confident that they know what’s ahead, that they can predict the future with reasonable certainty.

Autonomy: People need to feel like they have control of their life, their work, their destiny.

Relatedness: People need to feel like they belong, to trust that the group they are in will look out for them.

Fairness: People need to feel like they are being treated fairly, that the “rules of the game” give them a fair chance.

What is Visual Thinking?

Visual Thinking is drawing in order to make sense of the world. When you visualize something, it becomes more concrete. Complex concepts become easier to understand. Visual Thinking has been widespread in Science and Mathematics for many many years, and, like NeuroLeadership, is emerging as a best practice in leading-edge organizations.

Visual Thinking drives understanding, alignment, commitment and action.

At XPLANE, we help our customers design and run Visual Thinking sessions, where teams visualize their challenges, imagine creative alternatives, develop strategies and plans, and design the next steps in their evolution as a business. I’ve written elsewhere about what XPLANE does to create more connected, faster-moving organizations. My colleagues and I have detailed many of these ideas, principles and exercises and we have shared them with the world in a best-selling book called Gamestorming.

Typical business meetings vs. Visual Thinking sessions.

Many aspects of a typical business meeting trigger anxiety and emotional distress, triggering the fight-or-flight response and causing people to shut down. Visual Thinking sessions address and resolve many of those issues.

Status: In a typical meeting, status and hierarchy create distance between people. Sitting around a table increases the sense of direct threat.

A Visual Thinking session flattens the hierarchy. As soon as people start drawing, it’s ideas and insights that matter, not status. Also, because people are focused on the shared picture as opposed to each other, status takes a back seat to creating something together.

Certainty: In a typical meeting, abstract language, diagrams and complex PowerPoint slides create a sense of uncertainty about the future. It’s difficult to translate abstract ideas into concrete action. Without a clear picture, people procrastinate or act in ways that are counterproductive.

Visualizing the future makes it more tangible. Drawing a plan is thinking it through. Drawing what “good” looks like, who will do what, and how, makes the future less abstract, and reduces anxiety and uncertainty about next steps, reducing resistance and making it easier to move forward.

Autonomy: In a typical meeting, the boss or presenter is in charge of the agenda and the dialogue. Other participants are reduced to listening and asking questions instead of actively contributing. This reduction in participation leads to reduced commitment and makes it less likely for people to carry the ideas forward after they leave the meeting.

In Visual Thinking sessions, everyone is involved in making ideas and plans more tangible and concrete. This increases people’s sense of control. If everyone participates in creating the picture of what will happen, it is easier for them to take ownership and run with it.

Relatedness: Typical meetings are focused primarily on the exchange of information, not team-building. Most business meetings are dry affairs. It’s blah blah blah, until it’s over.

When a group of people works together to create a shared picture of their situation, their vision, and a plan to get there, they are simultaneously building a sense of who they are as a team. Creating a vision together makes it easier to take action after the session is over.

Fairness: In a typical meeting, the extroverts — people who like to talk — often get the lion’s share of the airtime. Introverts, who may have great contributions to make, may not get the time and space they need to share their ideas.

When we design Visual Thinking sessions, we design the exercises to ensure that there is time for individual reflection as well as group discussion and interaction. The structure of Visual Thinking sessions recognizes the value of both introverts and extroverts, and gives everyone a voice and a role in the process.

XPLANE is the visual thinking company. Visual thinking drives understanding, creativity, alignment, and commitment to shared goals. And it does all of these things simultaneously.

We use Visual Thinking to help organizations get better, faster. Give us a call. We’d love to show you what happens when people understand.

How we work as a distributed product team,"It’s possible to decide to be distributed for all the right reasons, but to screw it up royally with the wrong tactics and tools. The more a team is distributed, the more potential for people to move fast and get many things done, but for those things to not necessarily be the right things.

Why does this happen? Because communications is really, really hard. It’s hard when everyone is together in the same room. It’s harder when people are separated by time and distance. In both work and life, there’s one thing I’ve learned about problems:

All problems are people problems, and all people problems are communication problems.

Doing distributed team projects well requires that the organization and its people, tools and processes all facilitate open communications and access to information at the lowest possible “cost”.

Scheduling a bunch of meetings is high cost. It’s not the answer. You need to set things up so that, as much as possible, great communications happens naturally, serendipitously — by accident if you will.

At Talko, where we are split between Boston, Seattle and San Francisco, we’ve benefited from having previously worked together. We knew each other, we respected each other, we’d built software together before. That’s a huge running start that many don’t have. But it didn’t eliminate the need to be intentional about distributed team practices and processes.

This is not all-inclusive, but here are several things we do to help us communicate effectively without ever being together in one place.

There is no hub. There are no spokes. We are a constellation.

People often ask “Where is Talko ‘based’?” Many assume we’re based in Boston because we have more people there than in Seattle or San Francisco. I say Talko is based in Talko (the app).

Sure, we have an official company address for the purposes of incorporation. But we don’t think of our team as being based in any one location. We give equal weight to our presence in all three cities, regardless of how many people are in each.

We refer to our team as distributed, not “remote”. The word remote infers that some aspect of the team is centralized and others are remote. “Us” and “them”. “The core” and “the others”. Watch the toxicity take over once people start thinking and acting like this.

We model our company as a constellation, not as a hub with spokes.

This isn’t the only model that works for distributed teams. Arguably, it’s not possible for a much larger organization. But I believe it’s best for any small team that chooses to be distributed.

This sounds ethereal when talking about it as an abstract model. But the model, the words used to describe it and the way it’s drawn on a napkin matter a lot. These things shape the team’s mindset, how people relate to one another, and how individuals perceive and act their role on the team. They also inform the tactics necessary for the organization to be true to what it wants to be.

For example, at Talko we encourage people to work from home 2–3 days per week. We do this even though we have office space in all three cities. It’s a tactic that helps our people empathize and relate to one another as equals, always, regardless of how many team members live in one city versus another. It’s how we avoid situations where several people huddle in a room to tackle big problems and make important decisions, then later realize that ‘elsewhere others’ needed to be part of the conversation. Tactics like this help avoid obvious sources of misunderstanding within a distributed team.

We have a clear set of top-level projects.

A project is substantive enough to be sustained beyond any particular sprint or milestone.

It has a well-defined team of people working on it. Unless you have a 1 project operation, which may be likely in the early days, a project team is a subset of the overall team. It’s essential that everyone in the organization knows who’s on each project.

A project has well-defined goals, stories and designs, milestones and timelines. Project team members are all deeply intimate with these things. All others in the company understand at least enough to know and support why the project is essential to the company’s mission.

Our top-level technical projects tracked as Epics in Jira.

We have 5 top level technical projects at Talko: iOS App, Android App, Web App, Service, and Slack Integration. These are the set of sustained technical efforts that we organize, track and report around. We adapt our tools to work for our preferences. The image to the left shows how we use Epics in Jira as the organizing model for our projects. This is not exactly true to the Agile (capital A) definition of Epic, but it works well for us right now. We’re rarely compelled to be 100% true to the dogma of the processes or methodologies we use. We do what works.

We invest in organizing our tools.

There’s virtually always some way, some how for someone to get whatever information they need to do their job. The question is — at what cost in time, attention, disruption?

Let’s say you need to come up to speed on the technical design for a feature. Do you:

Schedule a meeting with the project team.

Interrupt a developer to ask them directly.

Go get the 2-page spec (because you know right where it is) and take 5 minutes to read it.

The first two options are costly. Operate like this as a distributed team and nobody will ever get anything done.

The point is that everyone needs to know exactly what tools are used for what purpose, and where to go to find what they need. Nobody should ever be uncertain of where or how to find something at the moment of need.

We use many different tools for different aspects of the business at Talko. Jira for projects, stories and bugs. Office docs, PDFs, and increasingly Quip docs for features that require specification. Github for source control and code review workflows. Amplitude for app analytics. Zendesk for support. Nagios, PagerDuty, Crittercism for error reporting. And more.

A sub-folder in our Dropbox. A little structure saves oodles of time down the line.

Beyond the specific tools, the important thing is that each is organized for maximum transparency and quick access to information. A simple example can be seen in the image to the left. It shows how the Product Management subfolder is organized at one point in its hierarchy in Dropbox. It takes some time and care to set up at the beginning, but it saves time in spades later on. There’s never a question from a developer about where to find, for example, the app analytics event schema spec — of course it’s in Product Managment > 01 Feature Specs > Analytics.

We operate on a cadence that naturally keeps people in sync.

We use cadence as a tool to achieve common awareness across a project team. Quick cycle times force regular communication and help people self-organize with a calendar that is near-clear of expensive meetings.

Shorter than typical sprints/milestones/releases create natural sync-ups, both planned and ad-hoc. It makes it difficult for things to slip through the cracks, and easy for a project team to shift priorities quickly when necessary.

For example, we do 1-week sprints. For co-located teams I’ve worked with in the past I’ve always preferred 2-week sprints. However, many things can change contextually over a 2-week period. One-week sprints require conversations to happen with a tempo that ensures people don’t fall out of sync about what matters most. No fancy meetings required typically, just a quick, often ad-hoc check-in as we move from one sprint to the next. Of course, for such a discussion to be quick it presumes that people have done their jobs prior, e.g. PM has prioritized stories and bugs for the next sprint and can succinctly communicate what and why to Dev.

Our work is done and ‘documented’ in our communications.

We write documents and detailed specifications for several things. A new and big feature area. Test scripts. Technical architecture. And more.

However, we produce far fewer documents relative to similarly scoped projects of several years ago. The document (or email) is no longer the primary artifact around which we do our work. There’s a flow to our communications and decision-making that is far more organic and fast-moving. It happens when we’re mobile and on-the-go as much as it does when we’re at our desks. It centers around text and voice messages, photos and screen-shares, and quick calls when we need to converge urgently.

All of this happens with very few scheduled meetings or document reviews.

The challenge is how to ensure all team members have access to the information they need to do their job, or to simply be an informed and participating team member. There’s no longer a presumption that everything is written in a document or summarized in mail. In fact there’s a preference that it’s not. Instead, there’s a presumption that key issues discussed and decisions made in the flow of conversation are “on the record” so that team members who weren’t there can be aware.

Talko makes it simple to find key conversations by searching on flags and tags.

Tactically, there are several tools we use to make this real. One of them is our own. Since mid-2012 we’ve had all of our daily standups, design & architecture conversations, bug triages, all-hands meetings and 1:1 discussions in Talko. The fact that all conversations — LIVE calls or messages — are saved in Talko means that key issues or decisions are easily flagged, tagged and discoverable at any time in the future. This helps in a range of scenarios. When an engineer misses daily standup but needs to quickly know the status of another engineer who’s working on a blocking bug. Or, when a PM is trying to remember why a particular design decisions was made for a feature implemented long ago (see image).

Slack is great as a single hub for real-time status of all project activities and processes.

Slack is another tool we use to support transparent, real-time access to our workflows and communications. We use many integrations — Github, Jira iDoneThis, Talko, Zendesk and several others. Essentially, the tool of choice for every aspect of the business is integrated with Slack. As such, Slack has become our hub for real-time status of any aspect of our engineering projects. A great example is our #github channel shown in the image. It provides a simple, stream view into what everyone is getting done. Like in Talko, what turns this from an activity stream to an irreplaceable productivity tool is the fact that all channels are easily searched. Anyone can find something that was said or done in the past and which may be important to recall at the moment.

Tools such as Talko and Slack won’t solve all communications problems. They can’t communicate for you! But it’s in tools like these where work is getting done and ‘documented’ these days, much more so than in files and emails. By turning conversations and activity streams into persistent, searchable objects these tools help our team avoid the lost time, misunderstanding and strained team dynamics that otherwise occur when people are moving fast and making decisions in the flow of communicating.

We treat team operations like a product.

A software product is never done. It can always be made better, simpler, more capable, more performant.

The same can be said for how a team works together. We treat our organization and its tools, processes and practices just like we treat the product we build together. We’re motivated to make things better.

We’re far from perfect. Sometimes we do things poorly. Sometimes things slip through the cracks. But we’re conscious and aware when these things happen. We talk about it. We make tactical adjustments when we’re convinced the benefit will outweigh the cost.

That is why, for example, I emphasize that using Epics to organize projects in Jira works for us “right now”. It’s why we recently made a change in how we do app analytics and the tool we use. It’s why we’re embracing an organic team shift from documents as files in Dropbox to Quip docs for many things. It’s why we’re currently contemplating changes in how we communicate client/service deployment dependencies to better support our aggressive multi-app release goals. And so on.

What works for us now as a 12-person team is not what will work for us in the future. As the team and our projects grow we will adapt the way we organize our work, how communicate, the tools we use and how we structure them to meet the needs of the business at any particular moment in time.",https://medium.com/talko-team-talk-share-do/how-we-work-as-a-distributed-product-team-834e9485ba7b,['Matt Pope'],2015-11-12 15:44:40.593000+00:00,"['Startup', 'Teamwork', 'Engineering']"
Why your next product should include a conversational Artificial Intelligence,"We learned to use Graphic User Interfaces because we had to, in order to give orders to the machine. We learned the machine’s language. What if we actually make the machine learn our language? I mean real language with sentences and intention, understanding, empathy even.

“The Fly” movie shows Seth Brundle having some chat conversations with his computer. He actually asks questions to the machine which will answer to him. Like a chat. The way he interacts with it seems obvious and easy but until recently, it was only science-fiction. Having a computer understanding a human sentence question requires a lot of work. Luckily, it is finally close to our present, even more advanced maybe, where Artificial Intelligence can give us the feeling that they have empathy. And empathy is what makes our brain happy.

“The Fly” movie: the conversational interaction with the machine

Make me feel something

Using the app Slack for a while now, I can tell you that I love Slack bot. I feel like he understands me. For example, when I post a Dropbox link on the app, he is so intelligent that he asks me if he should grab the document itself from my Dropbox and upload it on Slack. I can either answer “Yes”, “Not this time”, “Never”. When I chose “Not this time”, he answered me a full sentence that confronted me that he understood me: “OK, I won’t import this Dropbox file, but I will remember to ash you again next time.” I love you Slack bot ❤

Slackbot answers me using a full clear sentence of his intentions — I felt so well understood!

Really, that’s how strong relationships with computer could and should be. They are our assistants 24/7. As a product designer, my goal is to build apps or services the user can emotionally rely on. That means building this trusted relationship, including emotions.

Add granularity in the emotions

I like using movies as examples of Artificial Intelligence and User Interface as they are spaces where designers can go a bit further on their imagination, not depending so much on feasibility as we do in the real world.

On “Interstellar“, Cooper talks with the robot T.A.R.S. to get information and asks him to do some actions. But also, and that’s the most important thing here, he can modify the humor and trust settings. This is really strong Artificial Intelligence there. Empathy, emotion, humor that can be in different degrees to create a more plausible AI.

Interstellar T.A.R.S. has humor and trust settings

[Sci-fi movie nerd digression: I have to forget the fact that the shape of this robot makes no sense at all to me (seems so instable and could get stuck in so many situations!) and that its screen is showing stupid lines of codes instead of something else that could be, let’s say, useful. Adam Savage from Mythbuster seems to actually find the shape genius on this Youtube video (he still says the main issue is the stability/balance though haha) . Oh and this awesome article about the designs and sets for Interstellar: the part about how they built the Tesseract totally blew my mind! Sorry for the sci-fi movie nerd digression.]

Show me you care about me

Let’s go back to our subject: interacting with Artificial Intelligence. Remember the computer HAL talking in “2001: A Space Odyssey“? That’s what I felt using Lark app for the past few weeks. Lark, the Artificial Intelligence, is typing me some interesting facts about my health and I am really happy to start a conversation with him. I can even see the 3 dots when he is typing, giving me the feeling that there is actually a soul typing a text for me. Yes, I feel like someone is interacting with me, maybe even care about me and my health, and my human brain is really really happy.

Lark app where I really feel the AI is typing to me

Same feeling for the Artificial Intelligence used for the scheduling meetings tools Amy. Amy was really nice with me when I told her I was not available on the first days she suggested. (If you want to learn more about Amy, I interviewed Dennis Mortensen, founder of x.ai on the podcast Daily Hunt podcast.)

Make me fall in love

So when you think about your new product or service, try to have this AI aspect in your mind. How your users will interact with your app or service? How can you trigger the emotions you want from your users? How can you create the trusted relationship the user needs in order to fall in love with your product?

If you did not watch the movie “Her“, now would be the best time as this is not so a science-fiction scenario after all. The more we rely on conversational Artificial Intelligence, the better they will be designed (not the UI only but more the overall experience). Designed by us. By you. By me.

Or maybe… am I actually an AI without knowing it? *creepy Twilight Zone music*

Nine Ways to Tell Your Design Story on Medium,"There are so many examples of successful design writing on Medium. Here are just a few that exemplify how you can use the platform.

I. Share your knowledge

You have a wealth of expertise and experience that readers would find of interest. Facebook product design director Julie Zhuo regularly writes on topics like design process, management, common mistakes, and more:

Pasquale D’Silva explains designing for animation:

A group of designers from leading tech companies collaborate to share best practices, lessons, and stories:

II. Reveal your process

Give readers a peek behind the curtain with insight into how their favorite products were made. Vanessa Koch, who worked on the resdesign of Asana, provided insight into the process:

III. Announce a feature or product

Press releases are passé; instead, many designers write Medium posts to showcase new features or products. When Foursquare underwent a redesign and launched Swarm, Sam Brown and Zack Davenport revealed their design thinking in announcing both:

IV. Solve a problem

Show how design can be used to solve a problem. Shortly after Caitlin Winner arrived at Facebook, she noticed that the “friends” icon didn’t adequately represent both women and men. So she redesigned it:

V. Engage with your audience

While you can always broadcast your ideas on Medium, the real value is its network — the ability to interact with your readers to advance thinking. Jennifer Daniel, Erika Hall, Mike Monteiro, and others launched Dear Design Student to solicit and provide advice:

VI. Promote your company’s design talent

Competition for designers has never been fiercer. Showcase your company’s design bench with a dedicated publication, like Facebook’s, Uber’s, and (naturally) Google’s design teams did:

VII. Write ‘non-design’ design stories

You can write about design without writing about the design process. Medium designer Marcin Wichary goes deep on typography and language:

Basecamp founder Jason Fried does design criticism — of the Drudge Report:

VIII. Relate to adjacent fields

Design doesn’t exist in a vacuum, of course. Designers work closely with engineers, researchers, user support, product scientists, content strategists, and others to craft their products. Andrei Herasimchuk is just one of the many designers who’s written about whether designers should learn to code:

Khosla Ventures’s Irene Au explains how designers work effectively with management:

IX. Adapt a speech

Many designers give talks at conferences like SPAN across the country and around the world. You can easily adapt your speech and publish it on Medium, like Google designer Rachel Garb did.",https://medium.com/google-design/nine-ways-to-tell-your-design-story-on-medium-36edb2936bb5,['Kate Lee'],2015-11-06 18:06:11.832000+00:00,"['Medium', 'Writing', 'Design']"
Story or Article?,"A writer has the right and responsibility of choosing their content’s attire. You can either go to the ball dressed classier that any royal face, or dirtier than any hardcore punk. Either way, the spotlight will shine on you; what’s to be done, is simply determine which way to attract it.

The publisher — or any private writer for that matter — may go with the benefit of freedom of speech. No boundaries to mention if one is to follow this path of free movements in terms of words, paragraphs and other basic parts of a text structure. However, this is not to be mistaken with your text’s flow. Regardless of your choosing in general terms, including format, you must always have a comprehensible order of ideas if you wish for someone other than yourself to ever read — let alone enjoy — your written work. Back on the structure principles, it should also be noted that the very fundamentals of a text’s base must always be present regardless of your preferences. Remember, not even freely-expressed poets got away with skipping commas, colons, semi-colons or apostrophes.

On the contrary, a fan of logic, order, and structured thinking would surely pave the way towards a more technically-based text. It might even come to a point where their writing partly becomes a form of art; just like a painter examines every small touch of their pen against the canvas, a writer forms paragraphs only where they believe it will make the reader feel more euphoric than any other part afterwards. Both make choices to the best interest of their work’s final result. Never should one forget, nevertheless, that this path is not limited to paragraph-aligning and certain spaces in-between phrases. Structure also implies means of logic, like the ones we previously explained that will lead to de facto; graphs, statistics, equations, official papers etc.",https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/by-harry-samakas-8d1958e8e5bf,['Harry F.

The Architecture of. Multilayered Storytelling through…,"For each story we consider and pursue a topic we believe may be of particular interest to explore, ranging from current affairs to historical or cultural issues. Sometimes choices are driven by a fascination we have, sometimes by a compelling dataset we find and we would start from, other times we choose to present events and topics that are hot at the moment. We then analyze and compare different kinds of datasets trying to identify and reveal a central story, hopefully a not-so-expected one.

We start from a question or an intuition we have and work from here, then try to put the information in context and find some further facts and materials to potentially correlate. Every time we aim at moving away from mere quantity in order to pursue a qualitative transformation of raw statistical material into something that will provide new knowledge: unexpected parallels, not common correlation or secondary tales, to enrich the main story with.

In brand storytelling, I say it’s better to be safe than sorry and tell a fictional story. Yes if the brand tells a story and they don’t state if the story is real or not they can get some publicity. The whole bad publicity is better than no publicity can cause attention but will have consumers doubting your brand… I’d prefer to stay away from that and tell a great story. Making stories relatable and personable is key to connecting with the audience; I believe a brand can do so, without using a real person. Plus this gives the brand to create their ideal consumer and inspire them to “live like their brand.” It is very important for the audience to be able to tell whether a story is real. Certain stories can make an audience feel a certain way with their emotions and it should be an ethical responsibility for the brands to tell if a story is real or fake. If not, it can cause problems later on especially when there is no reason to lie.

For example, The clothing company Hollister created a fictitious brand story, BBC wrote in 2009 “US fashion brand Hollister uses logos and labels bearing the date 1922, but the company was only founded in 2000.” The clothing store would have still been well known without the fictitious branding.” Sometimes fabricated stories can work to cause attention and shock the audience. The company, Plan Norway created a fabricated story about a 122-year-old girl named Thea and how she was getting married. The blog showed her whole process of the bride-to-be causing awareness to young brides. The Huffington Post wrote in 2014 “The campaign was intended to inspire people to get involved in stopping child marriage on a global scale by sponsoring girls in developing countries. Plan International’s sponsorship program connects donors with children in need of aid. In exchange for monthly contributions toward ongoing Plan projects in the child’s community, the sponsor receives updates and letters from the child.”

Huffington Post was able to interview Olaf Thommessen, National Director of Plan Norway. Thommessen explained that “Plan Norway’s goal with the Thea project was to mobilize Norwegians to stop Thea’s wedding before the little girl made it to the altar on Oct. 11.The plan worked. Concerned Norwegians reportedly called the police to alert them to Thea’s plight.” Even though the company didn’t mention the story was fake right away, they wanted their audience to do something. Their story was created for a call-to–action which I can respect as a smart marketing strategy. They made the girl seem real to cause awareness and finally reveled that she was a fictitious character.",https://medium.com/once-upon-a-brand/the-truth-behind-the-story-e74c0d77517,['Danielle Darden'],2015-09-14 08:53:32.843000+00:00,"['Brand Story', 'Marketing', 'Storytelling']"
What programming language are you?,"I’ve gotten very interested in the life cycle of programming language usage. What programming language is “the most popular”, “the most useful”, “best for teaching”, or just “best”?

And in particular, I would like to understand differences based on who or where we are talking about. For example, most popular language used in the enterprise, or for game programmers, or in academia, or in startups, etc.

There is no shortage of studies of this question, and as a start, to tickle my interest, I’ve started a list of those studies. I will continue to update this post as I find out more.

Github is the code repository I know best, but one can be positive that it is not the only one. What we don’t know is how representative it is in general, or of some segment, for example open source. From Githut we can see that JavaScript and Java are the two hottest, and they are both growing. However if you look at Github’s own report, a slightly different picture emerges.

Toibe Software is an outfit that seems to have very comprehensive information, although I’ve not yet seen exactly what their methodology. Looking at their top level report, again I see Java in the number one place. The interesting thing is that here, the older languages like C and C++ show up pretty high.

Another perspective is what language is being used to teach programming. In this paper the claim is made that Python is Now the Most Popular Introductory Teaching Language at Top U.S. Universities. But according to that article, Java is a close number two followed far behind by Matlap and C.

An interesting related question is what programming language is easier or more effective to teach programming. Here I would want to defer to people actually teaching introductory programming. I could find various article espousing different perspectives. Many teachers I have come across believe that Python is a great first language.

Who cares about the design language,"So here’s the thing. Google updated its Google+ app, and it comes with a huge redesign exercise on it.

In case you don’t know him, Luke Wroblewski is a designer at Google. He’s been around for a while, commenting stuff about user experience and visual design. He wrote a lot about the Polar app — which I love by the way— and wrote the first article I ever read about the hamburger menu not working well for engagement in mobile apps nor webs.

The point is, Luke knows a thing or two about UX and UI design and he’s been involved in the Google+ redesign. That looks like this:

Credits to Luke Wroblewski.

This new app looks absolutely beautiful. I mean, look at all that color and rich imagery. And I believe I’ll never be tired of using specific color palettes for contextual elements that surround an image.

And the new Google+ app uses a bottom navigation bar, and suddenly the internet went like ‘that’s not so Material Design’.

Arturo Toledo is another designer I’ll use here as a reference. He’s been working with Microsoft for a few years, and his response to this was…

Who cares about the design language.

He claimed that our focus as designers should be on the principles. To make something useful and to design a delightful experience regardless of the platform we’re designing to. That there’s nothing wrong with a navbar down there.

I can’t argue with Arturo. I believe he’s right about this. Maybe not in all cases, but I feel he’s mostly right.

But I do have a few concerns about this navigation pattern though. And it’s because this is an official Google application, so designers and developers out there probably are going to reproduce this kind of navigation more than once.

You got me at ‘navbar’

I do love navbars. And tabbars. And everything that’s not a chaotic hamburger throw-it-all-there-in-the-drawer-and-see-how-it-fits main application menu. It makes things more discoverable, and it makes the app easier to understand without having to think and read that much. I mean, options are just there. Just a quick glance and now you know about everything the app has to offer to you. If you have any doubts, you just tap on the first tab and if you don’t find what you’re looking for then tap on the second one. And continue that way until you’re out of tabs. That’s it.

But then you introduce another main navigation pattern, that is the drawer menu itself. And now we have two main navigation paths. Or three, if we count the top tab-bar.

Credits to Luke Wroblewski. Again.

Ok, tabs in the top bar might not be a main navigation path, but they count as chrome. They count as more options, more space used for navigation. Good luck to you, 4-or-less inches screen people.

In theory everything has sense. You have supportive nav for user profile stuff, a global nav between sections and a contextual nav for the filters. But it makes me think. I can’t use this app without reading and taking a second to think where I’m going every time I want to go elsewhere.

I’ll give it a quick try here. How about moving the hambuger menu to the last item in the bottom navbar? — like a ‘more’ tab — and then moving the Notifications icon to the top bar, right next to the search icon. That should simplify the main navigation, just like Facebook does in its app. Then to reduce chrome you could make a dropdown menu out of the section title in that top bar to put the filters on it, just like Google Calendar makes to open the calendar control. If you don’t want to hide these filters you could A/B Test another idea. Maybe using an slider at the top of the page, just before the real content starts, like in the app market.

Where am I?

If I’m a new user of this app and I skip the onboard tutorial — and you can bet I will — I don’t even know what differences are between collections and communities. I mean, I could try to understand what they are, but it makes me think. They look almost the same and there are names of people everywhere and I can’t even see an interesting post until I’ve been playing around with the app for a while. I get lost in the many options you provide.

This might not be a problem of the design team but the product itself. Just think about it this way:

Twitter: There are people to follow to read their tweets.

Facebook: Mostly the same as Twitter but you can write larger posts.

Instagram: I follow people to see their photos. Oh and I can chat with them.

Google+: There’s people to follow and you can read their posts. Oh and you also have communities to follow and collections to follow that you really don’t know where they come from. And you can write posts and create communities and invite people and set up collections that have more visual impact than the posts feed itself.

Google+ looks beautiful, but making every content as visually heavy as the main section makes nothing look really important.

Be careful with bottom bars in Android

As designer Josh Clark pointed out, the options in the navbar are dangerously close to the Quit button — as he calls the Home button in Android. Collections is just a 2mm mistap from the user shutting down the app, or going back to the previous screen when they dind’t want to.

I always have this in mind when I design for Android. The solution might be moving these options to the top bar, but there are some issues about long words in other languages here. UX Launchpad talks about the tradeoffs of this solution on this post.

But getting back to Josh Clark, he pointed this out and Luke answered…

Theory vs. practice.

Here’s the tweet anyway.

If we assume Luke made a few tests — and I do believe he has — and he’s right, then we don’t need to move the bottom navbar anywhere. And that’s good. Yay.

Google+ is a great underrated product

This is all. Despite all these concerns I have about this redesign it’s still a product that I’d love to use more. Unfortunatelly it hasn’t found its place among the mainstream users. And that’s the biggest problem this social network has.

Maybe Google is working on this. Maybe they have big plans for Google+ that we don’t see because we don’t know what’s ahead in the product roadmap. Let’s just hope they keep improving this product and they prove that it’s useful for everyone.",https://uxdesign.cc/who-cares-about-the-design-language-daa3a99dacc1,['Paco Soria'],2015-12-04 18:51:57.989000+00:00,"['Google', 'UX', 'Design']"
by Jean de La Rochebrochard,"Funnel, Model, Growth & Retention

Whatever your business is, you have to master those four sets of metrics.

Funnel of conversion

The destination does not matter if you fail at taking the right path towards it. The funnel of conversion is the path from business origination toward closing and post-closing. If you run an e-commerce business for instance, it goes as follow:

Points of contact (SEO, SEM, Content, Social Sharing, Word of mouth…)

Converted into visitors

Converted into users

Converted into buyers

Converted into customers & ambassadors

This is a simple representation of what a conversion funnel looks like. What it also shows is that every single step matters and is connected to the next one. Visitors don’t become buyers, they become users at first: people who navigate within your website/application, interested in what you have to offer. They become buyers when they purchase something and they become real customers when you can build a relationship with them so they can buy from you again and talk about your service/products around them!

If you develop a mobile consumer app, it goes as follow: Points of contact (Appstore featuring, media…) converted into Downloads converted into Signups converted into Active Users (DAU, MAU…) converted into Purchasing Active Users?

If you run a SaaS Business: Points of contact converted into Visitors > Trial Users / Demo Request > Converted Users > Up-selling rate / Churn rate

Define your funnel of conversion, observe where are the bottlenecks, points of friction. See where you fail to lead more people toward the next step and focus on improving each step, one after the other. Don’t overthink, keep it simple.

Business Model & Model Equilibrium

Who are your customers, what do you sell to them (product, service, ads…), through which form (subscription, one shot)?

Your business model equilibrium is like your funnel of conversion, business-wise. You go from the revenues all the way down to the operational result. You must make the difference between the aggregated funnel of your business model and the detailed version of it. Let me explain it for an e-commerce business:

The aggregated business model equilibrium, monthly, looks as follow:

+ Average Basket per order

- Average Cost of Goods Sold (per order)

= Gross Margin (per order)

- Average Logistic Costs (…)

- Average Transportation Costs (…)

- Other Variable Costs Associated (in average of course, per order…)

= Contribution Margin (Pre Marketing Costs)

- Average Marketing Costs (Marketing Costs for the month / # of Orders)

= Net Contribution Margin

Net Contribution Margin * Number of orders = Available ressources to cover your fixed costs. You see, it’s pretty simple. The only problem here is that we only cover aggregated data. We have no details whatsoever about the gross margin per product, the marketing costs, the rate of returning customers, the costs of logistic and transportation…

You must take each of those metrics separately and observe their specificities, their min/max & standard deviation, how you can improve them individually in order to improve your overall business model equilibrium.

Focus on the ones with the higher impacts (usually on top, like the gross margin).

Growth

Growth is not gross! Let’s see it that way: if your startup does not grow, another one does. There are too many things behind which entrepreneurs hide in order not to focus on growth: Product development, Branding, Team, Technical debt… And many others!

Growth is something you always run after, like almost everything else in a startup. Growth is a full time, scary, challenging everyday mission to achieve.

What matters is the Compound Growth Rate. You should focus on the most downstream metric of your startup and make sure it grows, week after week, month after month. For instance, to calculate the growth rate of your monthly active users, the formula is the following:

((Ending value / Beginning value) ^ (1/ # of periods)) - 1

Month 1: 100 000 users

Month 12: 200 000 users

Oh great! 2 times more users during the period ?!… Except that ((200 000 / 100 00) ^(1/12)) - 1 = 5.95% compound monthly growth, and let’s get this straight: this is not great! Look at the real brutal impact of the compound growth rate over a 1 year period only:

5% growth weekly = Ending value 12x the beginning value

10% growth weekly = Ending value 129x the beginning value

30% growth monthly = Ending value 18x the beginning value

As you can see, if your compound weekly growth rate is not 5% but 10%, the impact is not 2 times but 10 times more important over a 1 year period only! Now, you understand how can emerge empires like Uber, Airbnb or Snapchat only few years after inception.

Retention

Retention is the Holly Grail of all metrics. It is useless without growth as well as growth is stupid without retention. Retention has many forms:

If you sell subscriptions, how many of your customers remain after 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 months? It allows you to calculate both your churn rate (how many of them leave) and your Customer Lifetime Value (how much one customer generate in average during a 12, 24, 36 months period).

If you develop a mobile consumer app, what is the ratio between your monthly active users and your daily active users (DAU/MAU)? How many of your active users remain active after 1, 3, 6 months? How many friends do they invite, what is the virality effect of your app?

If you run an e-commerce business, what is the percentage of customers who buys 2 times or more every year. How many of your customers are returning ones. What is the average number of orders per customer per year?

Learn how to calculate those retention metrics and for those who struggle with the understanding of a cohort, here is a quick example:

Why is no one talking about depression after university?,"Every year, thousands of students’ lives change dramatically, often leaving them isolated, anxious, and even depressed. It’s time we started talking about it.

“Anxiety about Monday would start on Saturday night.” Post-university depression is not only real, but also rarely talked about. Photo: Flickr/pigeonpie

“Imagine sitting on a limb for a long time and, when you try to stand on it, you buckle under. You can’t get up. Everyone around you is standing up and telling you to do the same, but you just can’t. You dare not.”

Robyn Hall* graduated from university last summer. Despite being one of the lucky few to quickly find a job in her chosen field, she still struggled with the transition into her new life.

She described the difficulty of coming to terms with her feelings of depression.

“‘But you’re a graduate!’ my brain yelled at me. ‘Grow up!’ But the self-loathing continued. You leave a place you’ve been in for three or four years, where you developed so much, leaving behind the closest friends you’ve possibly ever had. Even if you do get a job, nobody tells you that once you ‘hit the jackpot’, you’ll struggle to make new friends; that 9–5 will leave you exhausted. You’re scared of not being good enough, that you won’t live up to expectations. It’s the ultimate disparity between representation and reality.”

Robyn is not the only one to struggle with depression after leaving university. When I graduated, I went from feeling the happiest I’ve been in my adult life, to the worst. By October I was jumping at sudden noises and afraid to leave my bedroom. When a year-long relationship suddenly ended, I didn’t know how to see past the black clouds pressing in on me.

I sought help from my GP, who referred me to a local mental health outreach programme. But in the end, it was time, a relocation, and support from friends that began to stabilise the feelings of anxiety and depression.

I can count graduates with similar stories on two hands — and those are just the ones close enough to confide in me. Every year, thousands of people’s lives are turned upside down when they jubilantly throw a hat into the air, then watch it come crashing down into reality. So why does no one talk about the feelings of hopelessness that so many are left with?

After all, with over 900,000 young people currently unemployed and benefits for under-25s constantly under threat, is it any wonder that mental health issues in young people are rising across the board?

I spoke to Matt Tidby, who stayed in his university town of Norwich following graduation, supporting himself with temp jobs. “The majority of the work itself was doable, if monotonous — but things like the telephone, where I was expected to advise on mortgages after about half-a-day’s training, left me hugely anxious and very unhappy. I suffered on a personal level, and lost a lot of confidence in my ability to do both that job, and any of the jobs I actually craved.

“Quite ridiculously, I lived in fear of being ‘put on the phones’ — I built that minor stress into a mountain of worry that blotted out everything. After about a month, the job applications stopped. I got into quite a destructive system of trying to make it to each weekend without things getting too shit to handle. Anxiety about Monday would start on Saturday night.”

Matt eventually left the job, recognising the damage it was doing, and said that things were beginning to get better. “It’s a daily, rapidly changing situation, really — a positive email or a phone call can reverse many days of feeling low. It’s a strange inversion of my time temping; whereas once I lived in terror of the phone ringing, now I urge it to. I’m more hopeful that it will.”

While researching this piece, I found very little information targeted specifically at graduates suffering from mental health problems, despite an article in the Independent last year that found that of 40 students and recent graduates surveyed, “95% believed that post-university depression was very much a real thing”.

With so little information available, I contacted the mental health charity Mind directly. Head of information, Beth Murphy, had this to say:

“Moving on from university is often the biggest change a person has experienced up to that point in their lifetime. Added to this, today’s graduates are facing the double-whammy of the debt associated with paying for university and a tough job market that can seem impenetrable.

“Financial stress and uncertainty around employment are major contributors to mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Mind has seen a surge in calls to our Infoline from people struggling with financial difficulties, many of them post-graduates. Our In the Red report actually found that 85% of respondents said their financial difficulties had made their mental health problems worse.”

So if post-university depression is “a real thing”, why does no one talk about it? Is this the same stigma surrounding mental health that affects all sufferers, or is there something else going on? Robyn believes that there is a pressure on graduates to feel grateful for their position.

“Once you get a 9–5 job, coping with depression can be worse. People are all over to congratulate you, help you in any way they can; you’re so afraid of disappointing everyone that you just let the guilt fester away. I think even in the media it’s not represented enough that you can do your ‘dream job’ and not feel right.”

So what can be done? Beth recommends communication above all else. “If you are worried about your mental health, confide in a friend or family member or speak to your GP. There are also lots of small things you can do to make yourself feel better — exercise can be hugely beneficial, releasing chemicals which help increase wellbeing and mood. Keeping in touch with friends is also important, as withdrawing from social contact can make things worse.”

Whether you attended university or not, being young and uncertain about your future is the perfect opportunity for feelings of anxiety to take hold. I’m constantly struggling with my own mental health, but I’m one of the lucky ones; I have a job to focus me, friends to listen when things get dark, and access to medical help. But the same can’t be said for everyone, and with mental health trusts asked to shave almost 20% from their budgets next year, that last, vital support system is more at risk than ever.

It’s time to stop suffering in silence and acknowledge depression after graduation as a real risk to young adults. And it’s time to stop cutting the very services that may well save their lives.

“CHILD’S PLAY”,"play SimCity BuildIt for iPad. I play it so often, in fact, that it might be the thing I do most these days. It is not nearly as immersive and complex as past SimCity titles, but I nonetheless feel wanted, sometimes eve needed, and loved by the Sims who inhabit my city called Monteblo. Monteblo didn’t begin with my recent download of the game, though. No, Monteblo rose from a distant — and imaginary — location in the South Pacific around the time that puberty surged pimples through the pores of my skin.

Monteblo is a place that straddles time. There are books filled with graph paper pages on which are drawn the intricately detailed designs of Greek temples, and mayoral estates designed after Greek temples, structures that dapple the countrysides, suburbs and grand cities that make up the magical land. That same magical land is home to one of the States’ (Monteblo is a territory of the United States of America, of course, with voting rights) most successful collegiate sports programs: Deusis Testy. There are football and basketball cards with famous players’ pictures, heights and achievements on them. Among the most famous is of a player known simply by his surname: Frekmeiesy.

Frekmeiesy was a two-sport athlete who was bound to fall victim to his popularity. His name alone was enough to drive his Creator mad. It elicited smiles. Smiles from adoring fans, even smiles from opponents’ fans. Hell, Frekmeiesy’s appeal was so universal that his Creator’s Creators could hardly go a single moment without mentioning him!

And always with those smiles, those smiles that confessed simultaneous love and mockery. As his popularity grew his statistical output began to wilt. The hand of his creator pointed lightning bolts at him fierce enough to siphon the athletic ability from his joints. Game by game Frekmeiesy could but sit idle on the bench as other players stole the spotlight that was once his, players with normal names like Joe and Jack, Johnson and Franklin; players who could barely draw a glance from the home crowd much less smiles from the Creator’s Creators, no matter how high their shooting percentages!

The Creator had a soft heart. The Creator felt pain and bore great responsibility when Frekmeiesy struggled. Temporarily, Frekmeiesy was even removed from the basketball roster entirely. The Creator thought this would bring an end to Frekmeiesy’s front page fame.

How Twilio Bested Hemingway,"Ernest Hemingway has long been credited, perhaps apocryphally, with authoring the shortest story ever told: “For sale: baby shoes, never worn.”

The other day, driving off the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, I took in the Twilio billboard and realized that Hemingway’s record had fallen:

d

What a brilliant illustration of how even stripped down messaging can convey a powerful, moving story. (By the way, I have no relationship with Twilio.)

Hemingway’s six-worder is notable because it contains, if implicitly, all of the essential narrative elements. There’s a protagonist (an unnamed mother), high stakes for a future outcome (life and death of a child), a climax (death), and a new state of the world (moving on by selling the shoes).

Remarkably, Twilio’s three-word gem similarly leverages story structure to pack an emotional punch. Although the message ostensibly speaks to an executive (non-developer), its protagonist (and target audience) is a developer. The high stakes for a future outcome? Whatever communications-related challenge the executive cares about enough to be asking questions. The implied climax, then, is when the executive’s developer overcomes that challenge — armed with Twilio, of course. The new state of the world? One in which developers are respected and valued.

6 Ways Startups Can Design for Accessibility,"Why Does Accessibility Matter to a Start-up?

It’s understandable to say, “it’s not a priority for us, yet but we’ll get there,” when you are a startup without product-market fit. You have a lot on your plate.

My goal isn’t to convince you to solve for all the accessibility problems but be aware of the problems so you don’t make stupid design decisions. A general rule to live by is making your product accessible, likely, makes it more usable to end users and modular to your team. Also, many accessibility features for web, like “alt” tags improves your rank with Google.

If you build for an accessible future, like preparing for internationalization, it lays the foundational flexibility so you can easily implement it when you’re ready.

Acting like it doesn’t matter until you’re successful is a recipe for disaster and, more importantly, is pretty heartless.

How Many People Are Impacted?

Accessibility has many facets in visual disabilities, hearing, and physical. Each impacts how a person may or may not be able to interact with the app. If you want to think in business terms the market size that’s impacted is non-trivial.

6.7 million people from 16–75, in the US alone are reported to have a visual disability.

is profoundly deaf. 12.0 million people above the age of 14 in the US alone required the assistance of others in order to perform one or more activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living. This includes bathing, dressing, doing housework, and/or preparing meals.

Basics of Accessibility

There are some basic steps that you can take to be prepared to be accessible.

Don’t assume color vision — test your templates and designs in grayscale to ensure that all your elements are distinct without color. Don’t use calls to action like “click the red box to…” UXMag goes a bit deeper on some strategies to handle color deficiencies.

Contrast and sizing is important — zoom out 25% on your design to verify that all the major calls-to-action, core messaging, and interactions are visible and readable when you’re zoomed out. Don’t put key text on top of busy images without a mask. Use the squint test to verify that your key elements don’t fade away. Make sure to abide by Fitts Law in designing buttons and menus.

Use alt tags and watch out for micro-formats — alt and title attributes in HTML are used to describe images. They’re used by Google and by screen readers. Make sure that, if you’re describing an image, use well-known colors rather than an obscure proprietary name that means nothing to the average person. Also, micro-formats can be dangerous for screen readers as they have been known to misuse tags that are read aloud and cause confusion by reading machine instructions to the listener.

Sound shouldn’t be required — sometimes error feedback is only given as a sound. Don’t use sound as the only feedback mechanism even in the case where something good happens. A popup dialog, growl, or inline feedback could help accompany a the error or success ding.

Separate static templates from UI code — Although this is generally a best practice, you’ll be grateful you do this as you build out multiple front-ends for different form factors. Consider how your web interface reads in a screen readeron the web. For bonus, separate all your static text in language files so they can be internationalized as well.

Separate event handler from initiator — there is a movement to the Indie UIstandard so we separate how the “scroll,” “zoom” or any UI action was fired from what’s the app handler’s reaction to it.

For example, if a user wants to scroll down a page, they might use their finger on a touch screen, or click a scroll bar with a mouse, or use a scroll wheel, or press Page Down on a keyboard, or say “scroll down” with a voice command. All those different user actions can be translated into a simple IndieUI scroll event. IndieUI will allow web application developers to get these events from different devices without having to recognize how the user performed the action. With IndieUI, AT will have a simple set of events to control web applications, and web application developers will have a uniform way to design applications that work for multiple devices and contexts.

How do you get to Carnegie Hall?,"There’s a saying that’s generally attributed to a golfer, though there seems to be a debate as to its origins, or even to which golfer said it. In one version of the anecdote, Gary Player was accused of being lucky after holeing three bunker shots in a row, to which he replied:

“Well, the harder I practice the luckier I get”.

Wise words indeed! But I have never found it to be simply the case that a larger quantity of practice equates to better performance. For me, practice is a process filled with spikes and dips; barriers, plateaus and breakthroughs. And sometimes those breakthroughs can completely change the complexion of the thing you are practising. In that case, it helps to step back from time to time and re-evaluate to make sure you’re focusing on the right things. My own example of this pertains to the game of Sudoku, which I began playing pretty regularly about three months ago.

The Game

Sudoku is conceptually very simple. For the uninitiated, it consists of a 9x9 grid of cells and the object is to fill each row, column and 3x3 sub-grid with the digits from 1 to 9, each of which by necessity can only occur once in that row, column and sub-grid. The level of difficulty is determined by how many and which cells are already filled in. The idea, and one of its main appeals, is that you can find the answer by logic alone — in other words, you don’t try a number and continue until you get stuck, and then go back (though admittedly, I have in the past been forced to resort to that). Also, for any puzzle there is one, and only one, correct solution.

Up until recently I would only play Sudoku very occasionally, mostly in situations of alleviating boredom, like long-haul flights. What started the most recent encounter was when I was visiting a good friend of mine, and he had a particularly horrible specimen partially completed. He and I sat in his living room, with a movie playing in the background while both of us stared piercingly and unwaveringly at his laptop, willing it to present an epiphany that would lead to the solution, but it never came. Every so often, one of us would think we had cracked it, but as soon as we tried to articulate the logic and explain the case, it fell apart. The challenge of it was both infuriating and irresistible. I was hooked, and shortly afterwards I installed the Sudoku Free app, so I could engage the torture at my convenience.

The leaderboard

After being initially baited by the challenge, I played for the enjoyment, and to pass the time. The hook that kept me coming back over a longer period was incredibly simple: a leaderboard of my own top ten times, that would appear automatically as soon as the puzzle was completed. This naturally lead to setting simple and achievable time-based goals like: get all the top 10 under 5:00; get the top 3 under 4:30; get the top time under 4:00. The constant progression made for quite an addictive experience, and I would say that this definitely caused me to play more than I would have otherwise.

The easy versions of the game can be solved using a couple of very simple techniques, that all involve looking at the numbers and using a process of elimination to find the cell. The logic runs along the lines of: “In this sub-grid, 9 must be on the bottom row because the top and middle rows already have a 9 in the sub-grids on either side; and 9 must be in the right-hand column because the other two columns on the bottom row are already filled in; therefore 9 goes in the bottom right cell”.

Game Changers

For anything beyond the easy puzzles, the opportunity to use the logic described above is rare. To progress to the stage of being able to tackle them, we need to learn and develop some more advanced techniques.

Pencil marks are used to keep track of what the candidate values are for each square. You can reason about these pencil marks independently of the large numbers. Also note that when the number 9 is selected, all squares that have 9 as a pencil mark are highlighted as well. This allows reasoning based on the visual pattern independent even of the pencil marks themselves.

The basis for most of these is the use of “pencil marks”, an allusion to the pen-and-paper version of the game. How it works is that, for each cell, we mark all the possible values for that cell in a small size with a pencil, to keep track of them. The game then becomes about reasoning away the pencil marks in each cell until one remains, which must be the correct number. This causes a natural division of playing the game into two stages: the “Add” stage, where we fill in the pencil marks; and the “Remove” stage, where we use reason to whittle down the pencil marks enough that we can fill in the big numbers.

The next game changer came as a response to hitting a plateau in the existing technique. I had got to a point where my entire top ten were around the six or seven minute mark, but it was getting harder and harder to get on the board. So I decided to try a new technique. The Sudoku Free app gives a nice visual cue where, when a number is selected, it will highlight all cells that have a pencil mark with that number. Because of that it’s possible during the “Remove” stage to make some inferences on that basis without looking at the pencil marks at all. There was a period of time where I was trying to develop the technique that my times and consistency disimproved dramatically, leading to hours of frustration, and I questioned whether it was ever going to work. Eventually it did, and within about an hour I beat the entire top ten by over a minute.

At this point, it’s worth remembering the goal that is driving and motivating my continued playing of the game — and that is improving the condition of the leaderboard. With that in mind it’s obvious that, if at some point in the game I know that the time isn’t going to make the leaderboard, then there’s no sense in continuing. Even within the same level of difficulty, there are some games that will just “fall out” nicely based on the techniques I use, but others will take more work. Inevitably it’s the former ones that will end up on the leaderboard, and the latter won’t. I found that I could often make that determination pretty soon after the “Add” stage. So the new game is a very different type of numbers game, where improvement comes by quickly abandoning games that aren’t going to turn out in a good time, and instead exposing myself to a higher number of games so that I’ll get through more of the ones that will just “fall out”.

Now this really is a seismic shift in the very essence of the game. To me, this reality makes the game is a bit less “pure”. In some ways, I regard it almost like cheating, even though no rules are being broken. I think what it comes down to is that the personal attributes that are tested at this level are totally different to those when I started playing. Back then, each game was a test of logic and reasoning; now it’s about persistence, concentration, and physical considerations (Yes, I’m serious!..these days, I need at least a few games to warm up my fingers before I can get anywhere near the leaderboard, and there’s no point in playing at all in a cold room!). It’s effectively a performance, one that requires getting psyched up for in order to smoothly complete the puzzle without physical or mental stuttering. That is fine in and of itself, but I guess you could say it’s not what I signed up for.

Wait!

So the question arises: why I am still playing? Well, the truth is that I play a lot less often now than I used to. I think the reason is that the reward of getting on the leaderboard these days is inadequate compensation for the increasing effort. I believe it’s certainly true that the more you are made to work for something, the more you will value it, and there’s no doubt that when I do get a time on the leaderboard now, the satisfaction is large. But it takes such a long time of playing to get there now that it’s not worth it from an enjoyment perspective. The game was originally meant to be fun, but instead it is becoming a bit of a chore. In truth, the only thing keeping me at it now is a small amount of habit and a larger amount of stubbornness. So where do I go from here? The way I see it, I have a few options:

1. Go pro

Yes, there is such a thing! I could decide to take this seriously and dedicate more and more time to practice, learning and developing new techniques…somehow, I don’t think I have the stomach for that!

2. Stop playing

If the game isn’t providing enough enjoyment and instead is getting more and more frustrating, then deleting the app and not playing again is an easy way to solve that problem.

3. Revisit the goal of the game

I believe what lead to this issue in the first place is that the goal of getting on the leaderboard is too simplistic. It is a cold metric that doesn’t take account of the fact that the game should be fun above all things, certainly when it’s being played as a pastime. Playing without regard to the time releases the burden of having to hurry, and particularly awkward puzzles can be attacked instead of being abandoned.

And this is the crucial point, in my opinion. By allowing myself to be hooked by the cheap thrill of seeing my time on the board, I lost the part of the game that gave me the most value…the satisfaction of getting to the bottom of a tricky puzzle.

The lesson I take from this is the importance of setting aside time every so often to reflect and to identify the motivations for persisting at a particular practice. Is it being done for the right reasons, or is judgement being impaired by compulsion, or some goal set in the past that may be misguided or no longer relevant? Are you afraid to turn away from something that’s not doing you any good because of the amount of time and effort you’ve already invested in it? It’s easy to be bound by past decisions and old habits.

The same principle pervades at work too. On an individual level, I occasionally get an urge from somewhere to revamp my development practices. On a higher level as a development team, we have on one or two occasions in the past got stuck in situations that caused us to be ineffective for a time, like a feature that didn’t quite work as we originally intended. It is tempting to blindly stick to the original plan in the hope that it will come out as intended. But the problem can manifest as a general malaise, where everyone in the team loses some of the lust for the task. It has taken some brave and dramatic decisions to identify what’s going on and shake things up, even abandoning a feature we might have been fond of at the outset. But every single time, acting has turned out to be the right thing to do, and it clears the way for the next stage of progression. I think we have been good at that in the past, and always try to do it better.

When advances come at a rapid rate, it’s easy to stay engaged and interested. But ultimately, continued improvement comes not only from throwing more time at a problem, but from practising right as well as practising hard. And in my experience, a waning enthusiasm is a good indicator that it’s time to step back and make some changes. Until then, keep practising!

Here’s how you can preview your Sketch designs on Android Phone,"Sketch has got a lot of fan fare recently and if you ask me personally, I love using it. (In fact, I am in process of creating a full fledged tutorial on how to use Sketch for your daily work).

While Sketch has some very robust features when it comes in assisting you to design for iOS platform, it kind of falls short at a lot of places while helping you to design for Android. When the developers of Sketch asked their users about the views on what they can do to improve the workflow. Lot of designers responded with a request to make Sketch Mirror for Android. Sketch Mirror is an iOS-only app, which lets you preview your designs directly on devices (using some smart web sockets trickery, i think). Unfortunately, Bohemian Coding has not yet developed it for Android.

But, don’t worry. I found a workflow that lets you to preview your designs directly on your Android phones with a keystroke in Sketch. It involves a Sketch Plugin called sketch-preview by Marc Schwieterman, Skala Preview for your Mac and Skala View for your Android Phone.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how you can start previewing your designs on your Android devices.

Step 1 : Download the Sketch Preview plugin from this link. (freeware). Download Skala Preview for Mac from this link. (freeware). Download Skala View for your Android device from this link. (freeware)

Step 2 : Install Sketch Preview plugin by clicking on Plugins menu and selecting Reveal Plugins Folder. Unzip your Sketch Preview plugin files and paste them in the folder that had opened by Reveal Plugins Folder command. Restart Sketch. On restarting you will get 2 new options in Plugins menu. a) Preview b) Preview Setup. Read the documentation on the plugin page to get an in-depth understanding of Preview Setup.

Step 2 : Install Skala Preview on your Mac and Skala view on your Android device

Step 3 : Connect Skala Preview and Skala View. To do this make sure that your Mac and Android device are on same wi-fi network. In your Skala view on your Android device, click on the monitor/tv icon and select your Mac. When you do that you will be prompted to authorize the device on your Mac in Skala Preview app. Approve the authorisation.

Step 4 : Preview your design on your device by selecting the artboard that you want to preview and pressing ⌘P. This will push your artboard to Skala Preview on your Mac, which will sync it with your Android device. Everytime you update your design, press ⌘P and see the live preview of your updated design on your device.

At times there are problems in syncing the designs between Mac and Android device. If this happens with you, just go ahead and click on monitor/tv icon again on your Android device and select your Mac again and everything should work just fine.

If you have any better workflow to preview designs on Android, please feel free to share as a response to this story.

The Infinite Fount of Novel Ideas,"But there was a personal surprise, a gift just for myself, that slayed my greatest novel writing fear:

I don’t run out of ideas.

The first novel I wrote was four years ago, I used my first NaNoWriMo in 2012 to edit and finish that novel. Cheating, I know, but I needed the push to finish.

(I could use that same sort of push now, to finish this novel! — Anyone up for a NaNo-Finishing-Mo? Um, what’s up with the crickets?)

I clung to my first novel through the rest of 2012, and most of 2013, rewriting the same pages over and over again. I was convinced it had to be complete and perfect and publisher-ready before I wrote anything else.

Then October 2013 approached, with its belated San Francisco summer warmth, and I knew I needed to write something new, to release the suffocating attachment I had to my first novel.

From the great abyss of all ideas, new characters arose from my PaperMate Profile pen in my 9x12 writing book.

Set in San Francisco, like my first novel, these characters were new, different, and had their own quirks entirely unlike those in my first novel. The only similarity, in fact, was that I told their story much in the same way as my first novel — alternating points of view by chapter between a mother and a daughter. 55K words later, that NaNo was won.

Then this year, in marched the idea to write the sequel to my first (still unpublished) novel — this time alternating between father and daughter points of view when the daughter visits the father for a month in Manhattan.

62K words and counting, I realized the biggest surprise of all:

Faith that there are always new novel-length ideas.

Always.

My biggest fear was that at best I’d be a one-book-wonder, my first lonely tome destined to be the only title listed next to my name on my hypothetical Amazon.com bookshelf.

But once I created an outlet for my inner writer, the ideas haven’t stopped. I’ll be back next November, and although I don’t know what I’ll write next year, I trust the idea will arrive right on time.",https://medium.com/nanowrimo/the-infinite-fount-of-novel-ideas-2f7ffd0caa1d,['Julie Russell'],2015-03-09 04:02:04.532000+00:00,"['Novel', 'NaNoWriMo', 'Writing']"
"I’m A Writer, A Real Freaking Writer!","I did it. I jumped. Well, dove head first without checking to see if there was 20 feet of water or a puddle below. I first learned about NaNoWriMo years ago and thought what a massive project that was. Why would anyone want to torture themselves like that? And yet, here I am.

In the past several years, nearly all my writing has been non-fiction. The thought of writing fiction felt too difficult and too time-consuming. It’s just so free and full of possibility–how frightening. Then I did fictional writing for video game narratives a couple of years ago. That was fun. Maybe I could attempt some fiction. But a novel? An actual book, like that may one day be read by an agent and an editor and then published and I could call myself an author and have fancy book signings and my book would sit on shelves in libraries and be bought by people at The Strand and…

As exciting as that sounded, I was quite sure it was something I was not capable of. I mean, books are magical, authors are legends. As I found myself spending more time with writers though, it helped me realize that they are actually human beings. They have faults like me. Some have faults that are way worse than mine even. Those names on my bookshelves are not the gods I’ve made them out to be in my head. So maybe, just maybe, I could write a novel.

In the past year, I’ve been working on a collection of personal essays. Most are still in progress. Many are stories I’m afraid to tell. I get to them when I have time, and when I’m feeling particularly brave. There is one I’ve been wanting to tell for years. I’m not sure the moment I decided I needed to tell this story, but it’s been at least 10 years. I began writing a personal essay about it, and I had so much to tell I realized an essay could never contain all of my story.

After BinderCon, I was full of vigor, inspired to write and write and write. I felt capable and brave. I was ready to rip off the chains that have held me back and fearlessly put myself out there. I’ve been submitting to publications and reaching out to editors. I have been doing it.

I saw #NaNoWriMo come across my Twitter timeline about two weeks before November 1st. I decided to at least check out the website, for future reference. A few minutes later, I found myself signing up for it. I kept it to myself for a few days. I felt embarrassed. Who was I to write a novel? What a fraud—I am not a real writer.

I’d had these same feelings a few weeks earlier at BinderCon. I nearly convinced myself to skip the speed pitches with the editors. I told myself I had no talent, I was not a real writer, and I was wasting their time. I had no business being there and my pitches were awful.

I worked for a while the night before, tweaking my pitches, choosing some writing samples, and freaking the fuck out. I finished up and was still considering my options. I could cancel now and let the BinderCon organizers know so they could open up my appointments to others. That would be a nice thing to do. I imagined myself telling everyone I felt a little ill. I can’t admit I’m scared shitless or that I think I’m worthless. I’d have a bit of a headache, and pass on an opportunity to someone more worthy than me. That would be for the best. Thankfully though, instead, I took some slow breaths. I read some inspiration. I went to sleep.

I woke up the next morning, and somehow felt ready to take on the world. I had a couple of hours to get ready, washed away all my doubts and self-deprecation in the shower. In line before my speed-pitch, I met others who were just as nervous. They had never pitched before. They were sure their book was nowhere near ready to be seen by an editor. They had thought of skipping too. I felt enormous relief.

I walked into the room and found the first editor I was to meet with. I admitted I was nervous, stating I’d never done a face to face pitch before. She smiled and said, “I know, it’s really odd. I don’t even know exactly how this works.” And then I felt okay. We went over my pitch and she liked my ideas.

The next publication I met with had recently shifted their format and my pitch would no longer work. However we spoke about my experience and other writing, and came up with several other pitches I can research and get back to her with. I will hopefully have relationships with both publications going forward. I walked out of that room feeling like a rock star. I am a writer, dammit.

With all that negativity and self-doubt once again creeping up on me after signing up for NaNoWriMo, I reminded myself that I am a freaking writer. I also told myself anyone can write a book. I’ve spent enough time in bookstores to know that is true.

I revealed the fact I’d signed up on my 5 Things post a few days before NaNoWriMo kicked off. I was afraid to say it aloud. I didn’t want to tell anyone, I was afraid I’d be made fun of. I thought people wouldn’t understand. I’d hear it was a waste of time, that this would get me nowhere. I can hear a certain someone asking me, “aren’t there better things to do with your free time?”

Silently putting the news out there in a Tumblr post and then connecting with fellow Binders and others who had also signed up made me feel more confident. I wasn’t foolish. This is a thrilling endeavour I was embarking on. In a month’s time, I will have a rough draft of my first novel. That is a massive accomplishment. The next day I spoke to those closest to me, and they were all stoked. Those I’ve told have been nothing short of supportive.

My friend and I were just discussing serendipity. I can’t help but think the timing of BinderCon, some small writing successes I’ve had, and an essay by Sara Benincasa all came together to give me a much-needed kick in the ass. I have decided to do it anyway. To pitch to as many places as I can. To reach out and ask for a gig. To write a freaking book. To call myself a writer, a real freaking writer!

Good luck to everyone else who has stocked up on caffeine and candy for the month. Extra good luck to our loved ones who will have to put up with us during this time. Feel free to find me here so we can be buddies and help each other through the inevitable hurdles to come. I have made a Pinterest board for NaNoWriMo and writing, full of inspiration and tips that I’m frequently adding to.

I leave you now with a bit of wisdom. I believe it was Ernest Hemingway who said:

“It’s like I got this music in my mind, saying it’s gonna be alright, cause the writers gonna write, write, write.”

6 Video Game Stories as Good as any Movie,"5) Alien: Isolation

No movie is as frightening as playing Alien: Isolation with headphones on. You play as the daughter of superfemme Ellen Ripley, gone to the faraway Sevastapol space station to retrieve the flight recorder from the famed Nostromo. An interstellar mishap sends Ripley and her tiny crew onto the trading post’s loading dock without any way to get back or contact their escape ship.

Then it gets worse.

If you’ve seen the movie, you know what else was on the Nostromo, and you can bet something like it found its way onto the Sevastapol spaceport. Too bad it already decimated the crew and made the automated maintenance bots turn on everyone.

Isolation is not fun. At all. You have no way to hurt the alien that’s hunting you, and it never, never stops. You can’t run. You can’t even hide for very long. All you can do it try to keep track of the creature, and keep moving.

You have a motion tracker to help, but if you’re looking at it, distant objects get blurry, so you have to focus. The best way to monitor the monster is by listening to it. That’s where the headphones come in handy. If you have your back to a wall and you hear it 2 feet behind you, breathe easy.

"Insights from customer ratings on Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal","Thanks to the tremendous response for my previous article on #GoogleNow, I am now motivated to write more and finish off those drafts pending for a long time. Here goes one.

This weekend, I did some research on customer ratings on 3 popular ecommerce websites of India: Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal. I wanted to record the ratings and see if I can deduce any interesting patterns. Before starting this research, I did not really have an objective. I was not sure if I would get anything interesting out of this or not. It was more of an experiment than anything else.

Firstly, I could see that electronics and books had the most number of ratings. So, most of my recordings were focussed on these two segments so that I have enough data to validate.

Ratings Pattern

One strikingly interesting thing I observed: For any good electronic product with decent no. of ratings, the shape of the ratings almost always is like this:

Peculiar shape emerged for customer ratings of electronic products from Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal.

For almost every product, no. of 5 star ratings were more than 4 star, followed by 3 and 2 but there is an increase in 1 star ratings.

This kept me thinking… I wanted to plot this data on some graphs.

Electronics: Happy Customers & Pissed off Customers

For each product, lets say,

X5 = No. of 5 star ratings X1 = No. of 1 star ratings t = Total ratings Percentage of really happy customers, C1 = X5 / t Percentage of really pissed off customers, C2= X1 / t

A faster way to deal with email — “Slack-style email guideline”,"1. Do you actually need an email for this

Ask yourself if you can reach out to your client via another channel. The best way to reduce mails is not to send mails. So be part of the group that does not use email per default but establishes other channels against all odds.

2. Keep it short to make it fast

One of the big advantages of tools like Slack is the short message style. It’s more like a Whatsapp group or chat. Our average attention span dropped below the attention span of a goldfish. So the faster people understand what you want the easier they find it to answer. We of course do not chat via mail that would be nonsense but we keep it super short. Ideally not longer 3–5 sentences.

3. Stay away from formatting — you’re not sending a fax!

Especially younger people hate emails because you need to 1. find the contact persons email adress, 2. come up wit a subject, 3. start with an intro, 4. make it look nice and 5. end with an outro. Oh and of course attach an offical signature with company logo the legal section and of course your 5 social media profiles. In fact every email programm shows your email in a different way so even if you use a nice font it’s a waste of time. All this makes you slow.

4. Work with “mentions”

Group communication tools like Slack or Hipchat works with so called “mentions”. Instead of writing “Hi Christoph” or “Hello everyone” you write “@CM” or “@everyone”. Mentions allow you to structure an email and pull the readers attention to their section. That’s how a section can stay short even of your email in total is longer.

5. Work in groups not in a silos

A big advantage of tools like Slack is the searchability across all channels even if you just joined the a company. You have a full history to work with. CC’ing everyone is not an option but you can also build Slack like channel with a history if you leverage the email distribution groups e.g. Google Groups. These are projekt or client email adresses that include all project members. You would CC these groups, run a filter on them in order not to have an overflowing inbox and be able to search through everything even if you just joined the company.

Change Blindness & UI Design,"The test results are in and I’m afraid you have Change Blindness Blindness. It’s a terrible condition. Victims suffer from an exaggerated sense of their ability to detect changes in their field of view. The good news: You are not alone. 99.999% of the world’s population suffers with you.

However, if you design websites or software for a living, Change Blindness Blindness can have serious side-effects including…

Positioning error messages where users won’t see them.

Inadequately communicating state changes.

Depressed conversion rates.

Loss of income, trouble sleeping.

With a little time and attention, you can learn to manage your condition and, more importantly, help your users better manage theirs.

Change Blindness

Experimental designs used to demonstrate change blindness have eerie similarities to common, online user experiences. First, study participants are shown a scene. Then, some kind of flash or other noise interrupts the visual field. Finally, a second scene is shown, identical to the first except for one (often glaring) change.

People are surprisingly bad at detecting even drastic changes, like entire objects (dis)appearing from the scene.

From Supplementary Information for ‘Change blindness as a result of mudsplashes.” Used here without permission.

This handy demo lets you try it for yourself… http://www.gocognitive.net/demo/change-blindness

Why this happens isn’t entirely understood, but it seems to be a result of how our brains construct meaning from visual information. The interruption is crucial, whether it’s a total flash or just a few dots splashed across the screen.

It’s very much like what happens when you refresh a web page.

State Changes & User Experience

Consider what happens when you fill out a typical web form: You hit a button and some invisible process is kicked off. Your browser thinks for a few seconds, then its screen flashes white. If anything failed validation, the same page probably reappears with a new element: an error message.

Something like this.

As a designer, that all looks pretty obvious. You have the luxury of already knowing what’s going on, already understanding the state change you’re trying to communicate. You’re also looking at the whole page, you’re not in the middle of trying to complete task, and you didn’t have to look at it with a flash of page refresh in-between.

What your users see or, more accurately, don’t see.

Even without the refresh flash, having one’s attention focused on the bottom of the page, near the submit button, will make that error message as invisible as a ninja on your ceiling. (Look up right now. If you don’t see a ninja on your ceiling… it’s already too late.)

Slow feedback on button press, long load times, and extraneous things competing for your user’s attention can all make them blind to seemingly obvious changes in state.

Fortunately, change blindness has its own blind spots.

Facilitating Change Detection

The flash is essential to causing change blindness. If the state change is instantaneous, change detection is pretty much guaranteed. To prevent the refresh flash, don’t wait until form submit to perform field validations. Whenever possible, validate client-side as the user types.

If you’ve used the internet since 2005, this should feel familiar.

Validations that can’t be performed client-side can still be done in the background. Keep attention focused on the button location while validation is running, then display any state changes in the same general area. Transforming the button into a progress indicator is ideal.

A less conventional approach.

Participants in change blindness studies are better (still not great) at detecting changes in the center of the visual field, where most of their attention is focused.

Summary

Change blindness is a serious epidemic. Changes in state that occur during a page refresh are particularly likely to escape users’ notice. To clearly communicate state changes in web forms…",https://medium.com/user-experience-behavior-design/change-blindness-ui-design-687a8abf5ab6,['Dan Bayn'],2015-05-12 19:51:01.906000+00:00,"['Usability', 'Psychology', 'User Experience']"
Standardization is Crushing UX (and other UX links this week),"What’s hot in UX this week:

“Let’s not reinvent the wheel.”

If you’ve ever worked at a software company you’ve heard somebody say this during a design session.

As liberated and brash as we may seem these days, we are — more than ever — fighting a creative culture of fear. There are alternative views, of course, but this is something that designers and developers are dealing with on a regular basis.

We in the software industry often find ourselves struggling to break free of “conventions” and “standards” in the realms of UX design and front-end development. Interfaces are now crawling with informal standards that have quickly made their way from inventive to inevitable: hamburgers, swipes, likes, scrolls, and much, much more.

When no UI means good UX — 5 tips to implement a no User Interface product,"While I was enjoying a well appreciated family break in Charleston, I bumped into a weird object that made me think.

Here is the suspect:

Charleston parking spot meter

Ok so what’s the particularity here? Well, aside from the fact that they use an old device and updated it by removing the handle at the bottom (very confusing as you read all the messages and when it says “Insert coin — Turn handle to right as far as possible after each coin” you can’t find the said handle…), they upgraded the old school meter with credit card payment!

Yes, really. It took me a bit of time to actually process all the information and it’s only after I’ve put some coins (without turning the handle, duh!) that I realized I could have paid by credit card.

Ok so here the User Experience is definitely improvable but I want to talk about something else.

The beauty of this object is the fact that you don’t need an app, you don’t need a flow to guide you step by step (see the horrible UX of the Washington, DC ticket train machine I was talking about on my article “When you’ll design for the Apple Watch, think “when” and not “what””), you don’t have multiple buttons — you actually have zero button. This is a perfect example of no interface.

That’s what got me excited. Here you only see one tear and the credit card icon with an arrow. No doubt on what to do. You just swipe you card and you paid your parking spot. Boom!

This let me thinking about invisible products and services that we will design in the near future and I wanted to share a few starting point to implement a no User Interface product:

1. Pick a platform that already exists.

Digit and Magic are good examples of how you can design a service without designing an actual app. They use the already implemented and well used text-message platform to interact with their customers. Are they still designing a product? Yes they do as the users feel something and get value of using their service. They actually design a User Experience, in the original sense of it. As another example, Square Cash embraced the emails as their first use to send money to someone.

2. Build on top of an existing community

I see this being the next generation of product design. Handy is doing this right now by partnering with Airbnb for example: you can book a Handy cleaning service for your Airbnb listing, directly from Airbnb. You never interact with Handy but, still, you benefit from their service. Some news websites are also going on this direction as they might soon directly host articles on Facebook. The down of this, of course, is that you are depending of the community. So, always have a plan B!

3. Understand the users pain and need

This is the crucial part. The hard part is not building a solution: you need to, first, understand the pain point you want to solve. That’s where User Experience skills are essential in a product with no interface. You need the best people on this task. User interviews, user research, prototyping,… At the beginning of your project, 95% of your budget (money + time) should be in UX. Keep the last 5% for coffee. You’ll need it.

4. Fake it until you make it

Try and try again. Get the concentrated version of your product by testing it over and over again with some users. That’s what they did at FlyCleaners, the laundry service: getting the feedback from their users really help them to build the huge success they have now. You can listen to one of their founders, David Salama, on the podcast interview I had with him last week. Get feedback by watching people using your service. Hire some UX designers that are good at this but, also, do it yourself. Even if you are the CEO. Make everyone on your team conduct some usabilty testing. Getting the feeling of who is going to use your product is crucial. Specifically when your product will live only on your users’ experience, feeling and emotion.

5. Think out of the box

The Apple Watch interaction is so different from what we experienced in the past. The haptic vibration is almost an organic interaction and it even brings a comfort versus the noise notifications we are used to. Wired published an interesting article about the haptic touch of the new Macbook. When you don’t see the UI, you can still feel the UX.

3. Intro To Honking

For drivers in their first six months. Learn the ins and outs of ignoring the “No Honking. $350 Penalty Signs” as well as the ideal times to lay on the horn (typically between 1AM and 5AM, or while driving by someone on the phone). We’ll analyze different kinds of honks from the “Hot Girl Alert” to the “That Wall Better Move Out Of My Way.”

Note: Horns will not be provided but may be purchased for $200 or rented for $50/day.

4. Making Girls Traveling Alone Feel Uncomfortable

Prerequisite: Refusing to Pick Up Men, Old People and Black People

So, you drove by all the people who you can’t hit on and have a cute girl in the back seat — now what? Improve your skills in attempting to bring home this lady. Topics include: Asking which apartment she lives in when you drop her off, pulling over in a sketchy neighborhood and joining her in the backseat, telling her you have another kind of tip you’d rather give her.

◊

5. Spying On Couples In The Backseat

Prerequisite: Making Girls Traveling Alone Feel Uncomfortable

You’re right, it is ridiculous that watching porn on your cell phone is against the law. Who makes these laws anyways? Turns out, you’re in luck. The wasted couple you just picked up is ready to get their freak on in your backseat. As such, it’s your right, nay, your duty to sneak glances back in the rearview mirror and looks as you pretend to need to change lanes. She’s pretty cute. Good thing you have a photographic memory.

The Myth of the Full Service Agency,"Title photo by Napoleon Dynamite.

Forbes published this article yesterday based on a survey of what CMO’s are saying about the future of their relationships with agencies. The crux of the article can be summarized by this particular quote:

“The majority of clients, 62%, polled by my marketing consultancy Avidan Strategies admit that they now view agencies as suppliers, and that today’s relationships are no longer a partnership.”

And to punctuate their point, they embedded this image right smack in the middle of their page:

Not the sign you want to see especially when you’re driving 200 mph.

It is a good, albeit pessimistic (especially if you work on the side I do) summary of a few of the trends fuelling the disruption in marketing over the past few years:

The speed of adoption of new channels and tactics compounding the amount and type of work a marketer needs to juggle

The array of technologies being adopted by marketers, each with its own ecosystem of vendors and specialists

The rise of the freelancer economy

And a general trend towards companies doing more digital marketing in-house especially for those where digital is a driving force for the company.

The message is clear — CMO’s aren’t happy with their agencies and are seeking alternative solutions.

While much of this article is aimed at the “traditional” advertising agencies, these trends impact everyone who has a business providing any type of marketing/technology services to these very marketers. This includes the digital agencies, the consultancies, the PR agencies, the social specialists, the systems integrators, the platform vendors, the branding shops, the holding companies…etc etc.

All sorts of “agencies” jumped into digital while the water was warm.

The pool has gotten pretty crowded, especially when many agencies claim to be “full service”. If you look at the typical agency website, you’ll see an ever-growing list of capabilities. In the 15 years I spent working at, competing with, and partnering with all types of agencies, it always amazes me how hard it is for an agency to say NO to an opportunity:

Can you devise an integrated national product launch campaign? — Yes!

Can you build an enterprise ecommerce store? — Sure!

Conduct usability testing in Asia? — No problem!

Produce long-form video content ?— Uh huh!

Localize our website across 80 countries? — You bet!

Target millennial mothers on Snapchat? — All the time!

Can you create 3D-printed drones to take selfies of a flashmob triggered by tweets — We’ll figure it out!

Image of Dronie by Twitter.

It seems that over the past couple years, in a quest to jump in on shifting marketing budgets, many agencies have responded by simply adding more capabilities to their service offering and more bullets to their websites to shore up their claims about being a “full service” agency.

Let’s just be clear, in this day and age of channels, tactics, technologies and a multi-dimensional consumer, being a “full service” agency is pretty much like pretending you’re a Liger.

For those of you who have never encountered a Liger in the wild or have seen Napoleon Dynamite, a Liger is a not just a lion, nor is it just a tiger but it is a combination of the best of both creatures. Plus it has magical powers to boot!

The world has changed and these days are behind us. Today, there is no such thing as a full-service agency. For those who are still hanging onto the myth, well good luck. Everyone else has or should pick a lane.

Agencies aren’t dead. A new type of partnership must emerge.

Despite all the sensationalist articles predicting the death and potential unemployment for everyone in the industry, I still believe strongly (and especially in these times), that marketers do and will always need good partners. Marketers have their own challenges and despite the threat of increasing in-house teams, much like the agency business, they cannot be experts at everything.

It is a time for both marketers and agencies to focus on what their core strengths are.

Using Brand as a Partnerships North Star,"Choose partners based on values rather than reach to optimize for impact.

When considering who to partner with many teams focus on “the biggest brand that is willing to work with us”. Top-line growth is certainly an impact we intend to drive, but anchored by our brand strategy, our focus is “partners who share our values”. This answer opens up a universe of potential collaborators we would have otherwise overlooked — brands, fellow startups, community organizations, and influencers alike. We make no distinction. The result is coveted access to targeted communities where Skillshare will resonate strongly, with reach as a secondary consideration.

Make structuring a partnership dead simple — work with partners on only one thing.

Our atomic unit — “the most fundamental object of all in your service” (vintage ’12 Fred Wilson) — is a class. Per the brand strategy, it’s the one vehicle we use to make progress towards our vision of unlocking the world’s creativity. Following suit, a class is the atomic unit of all our partnerships. In other words, we don’t sell a “partnership offering”, we invite partners to collaborate with us on the one thing we’re already doing: building the world’s best catalog of online classes. The simplicity here keeps us moving lightning fast since anyone on the team can decide if a partnership idea is one we should pursue. It also ensures no resources are diverted away from company-wide goals.

Hire people who will represent your brand authentically, everything else is teachable.

We only hire people who understand our brand strategy, considering previous work experience secondary. These are not people covered in Skillshare stickers talking about the product nonstop, however expertly. These are people who get the creative community our brand speaks to. They’re able to articulate Skillshare’s vision with conviction (not a teachable skill) while being open to learning sales and account management processes (teachable skills). Of the 6-person team building and executing our partnerships, I’m the only one with previous partnership experience. My team — who I’d proudly argue is way better at this than I — is made up of a best-selling author, a graphic designer, a pianist, a DJ and the world’s only accredited sneakerhead.

12 hours in Yosemite,"Last November, as the world around me was starting to freeze, my wife and two children headed west to the sunny California coast. I hadn’t been out to visit my brother and his family for years and with American Thanksgiving coming up, we thought it was an ideal time to go. While there we also wanted to get out and witness some of the amazing natural beauty around the bay area. Not being all that familiar with the local geography, I hadn’t made the connection that Yosemite National Park was only a few hours away by car. I’ve wanted to visit Yosemite since as long I can remember and to finally have the chance was something I had to make happen. Considering we didn’t have a lot of days to spare on our trip, the journey to Yosemite was going to have to happen in one day. With the 3+ hour drive each way, was a day trip even going to be worth it? There was only one way to find out.

We awoke around 4:30am the day of our trip. We packed as little as possible, some food, books and toys for the kids. We filled up my brother’s Siena and we were ready to roll. The kids were still asleep and we got them into the van without waking them up; it was a good omen. We hit the road just before 6am and it was still pitch black. Google maps said the journey was going to be 3 hours and 34 minutes. I had my fingers crossed that the kids would sleep most of the way and perhaps we might make it there in under 4 hours, given the coffee and bathroom breaks.

We headed east through the yellow hills of the California country side. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky and the sun was just about to peek over the horizon. The day was turning out to be absolutely stunning and our excitement grew as we wheeled onward. Driving through mid-land California was a different perspective on the state I had only known for its coastline. It was incredibly flat, dry and full of farm fields, fruit trees, pickup trucks and rodeos. Not what you would typically picture when thinking about California. It was nice to see the other side.

After about two and a half hours we hit the Sierra Nevada’s and our route to Yosemite took us up some insane roadways that appeared to be dug out from the side of mountains. We climbed upward about 5000 ft. After a short while we entered the Stanislaus National Forest. As we got closer to Yosemite we noticed the base of most trees were scorched black from fire. Everything had scars and some areas had been completely wiped out. After some Googling we learned that there was a massive wildfire here in 2013 and was in fact the largest fire on record for the Sierra Nevada’s. It was clear to the eye how much damage it had caused. Large swaths of land completely burnt to the ground. It was called the ‘Rim Fire’ because of is vicinity to the ‘Rim of the World’ lookout point. The landscape was still beautiful, just perhaps not as it once was the previous years. After reading about the fire we came up on the lookout and we had to stop and take in the view. It was immediately apparent why it was called ‘Rim of the World.’",https://medium.com/get-outside/12-hours-in-yosemite-58ae876e855c,['Matt Quinn'],2015-03-07 16:00:40.871000+00:00,"['Storytelling', 'Photography', 'Travel']"
Offline: When Your Apps Can’t Connect to the Internet,"Image credit: photosteve101

Internet access is not ubiquitous. Everyone experiences the frustration of being offline. When you design a mobile app which doesn’t work without internet, you’ve made a decision about when and where your app may be used.

But consider:

You’re on a flight, and you don’t want to pay for Wi-Fi.

You’re on a camping trip in a remote location.

You want to unplug for awhile and get work done.

You can’t afford a data plan for your phone.

There are many reasonable instances where users won’t have Internet access. Knowing this, how will you design your apps differently?

Does “offline” mean “no content”?

Not necessarily.

Whenever you open an app, it has the opportunity to download content. When offline, apps can use this content to improve the experience. And most do, but some go further than others.

Image credit: Kārlis Dambrāns

Let’s do a walkthrough of some common social, mapping, and productivity apps, to see how they function offline.

Social apps

The typical use cases of a social app are to browse your feed, post comments and items of interest, and manage your network of friends. Let’s turn on airplane mode and observe.

FACEBOOK

First up, Facebook:

We see pretty much what we’d expect to see: our news feed and an alert that we’re not connected to the Internet. There’s a fair bit of content too. Well done, Facebook.

Now, let’s page through the various sections of the app, and see what we find. First up, friend requests:

This isn’t a great experience. The explicit “No Internet Connection” alert is gone, replaced by a spinning indicator that spins forever. That’s not very helpful or informative. There’s a lot of unused whitespace that could be better utilized as well.

Next up, notifications:

This is slightly better. At least I can see some cached content, though it’s not a lot. Unfortunately, there are now two spinners. It’s not clear what the difference is between them, or what is happening. And that’s still a lot of wasted space.

Finally, the miscellany menu:

The most obvious thing missing is thumbnails for each item. This seems strange, as those thumbnails are static and shouldn’t change often.

Now, let’s try to post something:

This is really clear behavior. My post has been queued for submission with a message (not even an error!) giving me the opportunity to retry submission.

Since this is a post I don’t plan to keep, I’ll hit the “x” and discard it.

Well done, once again. I get a popup reassuring me that the post will go live as soon as I have an Internet connection, though I can delete it if I wish. Facebook provides an excellent experience while offline.

The good:

Newsfeed is populated with posts

Offline posting sets clear expections with very good messaging

The bad:

Inconsistent alerts for “No Internet Connection”

Loading spinners which never stop

Poor use of available space on loading screens

Missing menu thumbnails

PINTEREST

Next up, Pinterest:

This is a very underwhelming screen to see when I first open the app. There is zero content here for me to browse. In addition, the app doesn’t explain why there’s a lack of content. There isn’t any indication that I’m offline.

As with Facebook, let’s page through the different sections. First, search:

Oddly enough, there is content here. I don’t expect search to work, but it’s interesting that there’s a landing page at all. Again, no indication that I’m offline.

Let’s type in a search keyword, just for kicks:

The search result screen is basically identical to my home page. It tells me there are no pins, but not why. Did I mistype my search term?

Let’s try to add a pin and see what happens:

So far, so good. I want to pin a photo, so I’ll click “Photos”.

I was able to easily select a photo. Let’s add my pin to a board:

Bummer. Pinterest doesn’t cache my existing boards. I’ll have to create a new one:

That’s very bad. Pinterest allows me to get through that entire workflow before telling me that offline pinning is impossible. It won’t even let me save a draft of the pin for later.

Let’s see what my profile looks like:

It looks like I have no pins and no boards, which is false, but Pinterest isn’t telling me why. Ironically, my stats are accurate (number of pins, likes, followers, following), but are in stark contradiction with the list of pins and boards below.

What happens if I click “47 Pins”?

Yet another inconsistent view. The counter in the top right shows “47”, but the list below tells me there are no pins to display. This is a very poor offline experience.

The good:

There’s really nothing great about using this app offline

The bad:

No cached content (and no explanation why)

I’m allowed to get far into the pinning process before learning it’s impossible

Profile stats contradict what is shown

INSTAGRAM

So far, we’ve seen a big difference in the offline experience of social apps. How does Instagram fare?

This feels very similar to Facebook. There’s a good bit of content preloaded, and a prominent “No Internet Connection” alert.

Let’s page through the sections and see what we find. “Explore” first:

Not great, as there’s no content here, but at least we don’t have the infinite spinners of the Facebook app. A simple option to refresh the page is much more sensible.

What about my user profile?

Similar to Pinterest, none of this content is loaded. However, neither are the stats, which means they aren’t in conflict. Also, Instagram remains clear about the lack of an Internet connection.

Can we edit the profile?

Nope. In contrast to the clear “No Internet Connection” message in the previous screens, this one is very ambiguous. And a terrible use of whitespace.

Finally, let’s try the direct messaging feature:

A similar result to the “Edit Profile” screen. However, the messaging (and message styling) is different for no good reason.

Overall, I’d place the Instagram offline experience somewhere between Facebook and Pinterest. Good, but not great.

The good:

The “No Internet Connection” signs are mostly consistent across the app

The bad:

Can’t edit a user profile

The only cached content is from the main feed

Poor use of whitespace

TWITTER

Let’s look at one more social app: Twitter.

As with Facebook and Instagram, there’s a good bit of cached content available. Unlike those apps, there is no messaging to indicate that you’re offline. That’s not necessarily a problem, but I prefer to be told that the app is offline.

Let’s take a look at notifications:

It’s clear that Twitter takes caching seriously. The number of notifications here is impressive.

What about messages?

Here we have a clear message prompting us to retry. It should probably indicate the reason that messages aren’t loading, but that’s a minor quibble.

I didn’t have any direct messages when I took this screenshot. Later, I checked this screen, and it showed a list of direct messages while offline, with no message indicating any loading problems. This is very consistent with the timeline and notification sections.

Next, let’s look at my user profile:

As with the other social apps, none of my personal content has been cached. But here, there’s a clear message that content isn’t loading.

Can I edit my profile?

Maybe? No error message yet. Let me make a change and click “Save”.

Nope. And an incomprehensible error message at that. It would be better to disable the actions that are impossible to perform in offline conditions, like “Edit Profile”, and explain why, rather than letting users click them.

Now, I’m going to try composing a new tweet:

Click “Tweet”:

And… nothing happens. That’s not very reassuring. I expect confirmation that my tweet will post as soon as I have Internet connectivity, as Facebook does.

Let’s scroll through the different timeline views now. First, “Discover”:

Cached content. Fantastic. Now, “Activity”:

No cached content here.

Let’s click the “Follow people” button, just for fun:

Not only are there no recommendations, this is a horribly-designed empty state. I’ve complained about poorly-used whitespace in other apps, but this space has been filled with useless UI, which is far worse.

The good:

Lots of cached content. Far and away the best.

Clear and (mostly) consistent Internet connectivity errors

Offline posting works, though with the caveat above

The bad:

Caching is handled very differently across the app

Looks like you can edit a profile offline, until you can’t

Awful “Can’t edit profile” message

No confirmation after composing a tweet offline

Poorly designed “Follow people” view

To sum up, none of these social apps nail the offline experience, but some are clearly better than others. In general, there’s lots of room for improvement.

Mapping apps

The typical use case of mapping apps is to get you where you need to go. Apps won’t get you new directions while offline, but how well do Google Maps and Apple Maps use their cache?

GOOGLE MAPS

Remember, in offline mode, apps don’t know your current location. Let’s open Google Maps and see how it handles that:

It remembers my last location, and starts me there. We’re zoomed in pretty far though. Mapping apps have access to a lot of data, and have to be selective about what they cache. Let’s zoom out and see what Google Maps has cached:

Downtown Portland. Can we zoom further?

Portland metro area. More?

And there’s the cutoff. Not bad, all things considered, though I don’t know why they didn’t include a high-level map of the entire Earth, if only for context.

What else can we do offline?

Let’s try switching to Satellite view:

That doesn’t work. We have a cached street map view, but no other views.

Let’s look into the settings:

There are lots of pages here. Since most of these aren’t settings that people will change often, I won’t go through these now. Some options work offline, others don’t, and the only way to tell is to try accessing each section, which feels disconcerting.

Once I finished with the settings, I switched back to map mode. To my surprise, the map had entirely disappeared. Bad news if I had been depending on it.

All in all, a reasonable offline experience, with a few nasty surprises.

The good:

Remembers your last location

Holds an impressive amount of map detail in cache

The bad:

Forces me to guess what works online and what doesn’t

Maps disappear and won’t come back

APPLE MAPS

Google Maps has a reasonable offline experience, so what about Apple Maps? Let’s open it and find out:

First, Apple Maps refuses to show my last position on the map. Also, it doesn’t appear to cache any of the map, at this zoom level anyway.

And now I get a popup telling me that I need to turn off airplane mode to see my current location. I click “Cancel” instead. Let’s zoom out and see if any of the map has been cached.

The answer is “yes, but not much”. Only Portland, Oregon and the surrounding area. Let’s zoom out farther.

This is strange. If you’re going to show a pin for my last search result, it would make sense to cache that part of the map.

Let’s try Satellite view:

Nothing. Not terribly surprising, given that Google Maps didn’t cache Satellite view either. All in all, a pretty lackluster performance.

The good:

Not much good to be said about this offline experience

The bad:

Very limited caching of the map

Doesn’t show your last position

Productivity apps

Let’s finish with a productivity app. The primary use cases of a productivity app is to sync files across your devices, and let you open and work with those files.

DROPBOX

How well does Dropbox perform?

Everything looks great. What about photos?

Same here. Of course, this is what I would expect, since these files already exist on my device. Let’s look at the “Favorites” section now:

I don’t have any favorite files, but if I click “Learn more”…

…I get a “No Internet Connection” message. It seems like a strange choice to not cache instructions for using the app. Regardless, this is one of the nicer error messages I’ve seen. It’s informative, makes good use of the space, and is clever as well.

Let’s look at the “Settings” section:

Lots of options here. I won’t go through these, but as with Google Maps, the only way to know which options work offline and which don’t is to click them.

Now, let’s try to upload a file to Dropbox:

I choose “Add Files”…

…“Photos”, select a photo, and…

…get an error message. In this case, the error message is misleading. The message tells me that the upload failed, but when I close it…

…Dropbox queues the photo for upload later, like Facebook and Twitter do. The behavior is good, but the messaging around it is confusing. But all in all, a reasonable experience.

The good:

File uploads are queued while offline

“No internet connection” error messages are well-designed

The bad:

Help content is not available offline

“Upload failed” message is misleading

Principles of good offline design

AGGRESSIVE CACHING IS A BETTER USER EXPERIENCE

When I open an app, I expect to see lots of content there, regardless of whether I’m connected to the Internet or not. If the content isn’t there, I’ll get frustrated and switch to a different app which does a better job of caching the information I want to see.

LET PEOPLE INTERACT WITH THEIR CONTENT. ALWAYS.

One solution to caching is to show the information, but keep it read-only. This isn’t adequate. If I’m reading a post on my social feed, I want to comment while the thought is fresh in my mind. If you make me wait, I won’t interact with it at all.

It’s okay if the information won’t be uploaded until I have an Internet connection. I just want to record my thoughts. Instead, remind me that I’m offline and that my posts will go online when I do.

MAKE ERROR MESSAGES INFORMATIVE AND CONSISTENT

A loading spinner that never stops isn’t helpful. If I don’t have Internet connectivity, and you don’t have my content cached, tell me. I won’t be offended, and I’ll be grateful that you set clear expectations for the experience.

DON’T LET PEOPLE START SOMETHING THEY CAN’T FINISH

If I get to the end of a multi-step workflow, only to find that I can’t complete it while offline, I’m going to be ticked off. Tell me up front. Better yet, don’t let me start the workflow. Consider hiding the workflow from the interface until I’m back online.

DON’T SHOW CONTRADICTORY INFORMATION

If you tell somebody that they have a new message, but when they open their inbox, there’s nothing there, they’ll be confused. Make sure all portions of your app are telling the same story.

WHEN CACHING, CHOOSE BREADTH OVER DEPTH.

If I can browse my feed, but not my own profile page, that’s a disjointed experience. It’s better to cache a little of everything than a lot of some things and nothing of others.

DESIGN YOUR EMPTY STATES WELL

They’re easy to overlook, but empty states often look… empty. Vast swaths of unused screen real-estate is wasteful and looks bad. Instead, use the potential frustration of an empty view to surprise and delight your users.

That said, even though an empty screen is bad, a screen filled with pointless UI is worse. Make your empty states simple and elegant, not cluttered and redundant.

NEVER SHOW THE RAW ERROR MESSAGE

Messages like Error: The operation couldn’t be completed. (kCFErrorDomainCFNetwork error 2.) are cryptic and scary. If you can’t connect to the Internet, tell people so in simple words.

REMEMBER WHAT YOUR USERS WERE DOING LAST

If your app is sensitive to location, be responsible and take users to where they were last. It’ll help them regain their bearings and know where they are. If you regain Internet connectivity, allow them to jump to their present location.

NEVER PURGE THE CACHE WHILE OFFLINE

I depend on my data to keep me informed, safe, and cognizant of my surroundings. If it suddenly disappers, I’ll be lost, perhaps literally. Wait until I’m back online before you refresh my data.

And that’s it. Designing offline apps can feel like an edge case, but your users will be grateful that you took the time to give them what they needed, when they needed it.

Sharing Cars with Strangers. Much of my life has been an exercise in…,"Days blur into weeks and months into seasons. I can’t remember how I imagined 2015, but it looks different from the other side. I’ve made and lost friends and watched others slip away. I’ve seen familiar buildings torn down and grown used to the vacant spaces they’ve left behind. I’ve found comfort in recognizing the same faces along my morning commute.

Last week I got into a car with two strangers, both artists. The driver made whimsical etchings of skeletons doing things like driving a convertible over the Bay Bridge. The passenger was a graphic designer. I don’t remember the details. We dropped her off at the Academy of Art and headed north, toward my apartment.

Traffic was heavy and it had been a long week; I’d woken up that Tuesday thinking it was Saturday. We crawled up Third Street and I regretted leaving the office during rush hour. The driver sat beside me, quiet, and I noticed his three watches — two on the right wrist and one on the left.

“We have so much time,” he said.

I didn’t detect any irony.

On the face of one watch, Salvador Dalí looked up at me with his crazy eyes wide and mustache erect. The antennae of his whiskers marked the minute and hour. An ant marched around the perimeter, telling the seconds.

“If you wear three watches, you’ll always have time to do the things you want to do,” he said.

I laughed. He didn’t.

“Are you a fan of Dalí?” I asked.

“Yes, very much,” he said, nodding at a photo he’d taped to the inside of his windshield. This version of the painter held a cat — a pet ocelot, I recalled, named Babou. How strange the things we remember.

I wasn’t paying attention when the driver asked me a question.

“Have you ever been in the eye of a hurricane?” he asked again.

I recalled sitting at home during heavy rains — but no, that’s not the same.

“It’s otherworldly. Like being in a dream,” he said.

He told me about sitting in his backyard during the middle of a storm. He lived in the south and thunderstorms were common, but his was a big one. I imagined him in a plastic chair in the middle of an unkempt lawn, eyes closed.

“Not even the birds are chirping,” he said. “They know before we do.”

I asked how long he stayed outside, but he didn’t know.

“I sat there until it was stupid to stay,” he said. “At a certain point, you have to go back inside. I didn’t want to, though.”

Much of my life has been an exercise in leaving at the right time.

“Time stands still,” he said. “I can’t explain it to you. If you ever experience it, you’ll understand.”

I wished desperately to understand. I still do. The ant kept marching around his Dali watch.",https://medium.com/ondemand/sharing-cars-with-strangers-9fbd4a8a0e61,['Lauren Scherr'],2015-05-21 21:45:32.872000+00:00,"['San Francisco', 'Storytelling', 'Lyft']"
Memorise 75 Ayat from the Qur’an in Just 15–20 Minutes a Day,"By Shamsiya Noorul Quloob

The Prophet ﷺ said, “The one who was devoted to the the Qur’an will be told on the Day of Resurrection: ‘Recite and ascend (in ranks) as you used to recite when you were in the world. Your rank will be at the last Ayah you recite”. [Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi]

With the precious month of Ramadan upon us, it benefits us to try our best to memorise the Qur’an. During Ramadan when everyone is trying to maximise their good deeds, we can benefit immensely from the repetitive nature of Qur’an. Memorising one verse is equal to the memorisation of 31 or 5 verses in some cases.

During Ramadan when the reward of every good deed is with Allah alone, we can dedicate just 15 to 25 minutes, and end up memorising more than 70 verses of the Qur’an. However, we can be one step ahead of the race to win Allah’s pleasure by starting early and making a conscious effort to start memorising now. But first, let’s understand the nature of the Qur’an.

So, why does the Qur’an repeat itself?

Before we understand the repetitive nature of Qur’an, let us understand ourselves. Qur’an calls us ‘insaan’. Linguistically speaking, “Insaan” comes from the root word ‘nisyân’ which means ‘to forget’. The second one is ‘unsiyah’, which means ‘to relate, to love-be loved, to become close to’. Ibn Abbas (r) said that al-insân is called so because of his forgetfulness. Our very name tells us about our nature, we are a forgetful lot. The things that are hardest to internalise are the things that are mentioned most in the Qur’an. Taqwa (righteousness, piety, goodness) of Allah is repeatedly mentioned because it is something we tend to forget the most in this world that constantly bombards us with materialism.

Below are 10 verses from the Qur’an that we will often encounter. Let us memorise and extract guidance from them [all transliterations are from Quran.com]. In the last 2 days of Ramadan, ensure that your ranks in jannah are raised 71 times, In sha Allah!

VERSE #1: 2 Verses [Surah 2, 31: Verse 5]

أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ Ola-ika AAala hudan minrabbihim waola-ika humu almuflihoon

Those are on [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful. [Click here for audio]

Reflection:

Successful refers to all bounties that come from Allah. They may be:

Physical gifts e.g. food, clothing, houses, gardens, wealth etc. or

Intangible gifts e.g. influence, power, birth and the opportunity flowing from it, health and talents etc. or

Spiritual gifts e.g. insight into good and evil, understanding of men, the captivity of love, etc.

We are to use all bounties in humility and moderation. We need to share them with for the well-being of others. We are to be neither ascetics nor luxurious sybarites, neither selfish misers nor thoughtless prodigals. The right use of bounties will, In sha Allah, lead to an increase future bounties. Believers receive blessings because they submit to Allah’s will. They will do well in this life (from the highest standpoint) and they will reach their true goal in the future, In sha Allah.

VERSE #2: 6 Verses [Surah 2, 3, 29, 30, 31, 32: Verse 1]

الم Alif, Laam, Meem Alif, Laam, Meem [Click here for audio]

Reflection: Huruf-e-muqatta’at — the disjointed letters.

A large number of scholarly books have been written over the centuries on the possible meanings and the probable significance of these disjointed letters — the muqatta’at. Opinions have been numerous but without a final conclusion.

There is no reliable report of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ having used such expressions in his ordinary speech, or his having thrown light on its usage in the Qur’an. More importantly, none of his companions seemed to have asked him about it.

These letters are usually used in the Qur’an when one needs to pay attention. The Arabs knew these letters but didn’t know them in this fashion and it caught their attention. Only Allah knows what their true meaning is.

VERSE #3: 2 Verses [Surah Al Baqarah 2: 42] & [Surah Al-Imran 3: Verse 71]

وَلَا تَلْبِسُوا الْحَقَّ بِالْبَاطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُوا الْحَقَّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ Wala talbisoo alhaqqa bilbatiliwataktumoo alhaqqa waantum taAAlamoon [Surah Al Baqarah 2: 42]

And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know (it). [Click here for audio]

With a slight difference:

يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَلْبِسُونَ الْحَقَّ بِالْبَاطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُونَ الْحَقَّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ Ya ahla alkitabi limatalbisoona alhaqqa bilbatili wataktumoonaalhaqqa waantum taAAlamoon [Surah Al-Imran 3: Verse 71]

O People of the Scripture, why do you confuse the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know [it]? [Click here for audio]

Reflection There are many ways of preventing access to the truth. One is to tamper with it or dress it up with colours of falsehood; half-truths are often more dangerous than obvious falsehoods. Another is to conceal it altogether. Those who are jealous of a believer will not allow his credentials or virtues be known, or might seek to vilify him or conceal facts that would draw people to him. When people deprive themselves of the light (of which we are ourselves witnesses), they are descending to the lowest depths of degradation. They are doing more harm to themselves than to anyone else.

VERSE #4: 4 Verses [Surah Al-Qamar 54: Verses 17, 22, 32, 40]

وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا الْقُرْآنَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِنْ مُدَّكِرٍ Walaqad yassarna alqur-ana liththikrifahal min muddakir

And We have certainly made the Qur’an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember? [Click here for audio]

Reflection The Qur’an’s guidance for man’s conduct are plain and easy to understand and act upon. Is this not in itself an act of grace from Allah? What excuse is there for anyone who fails?

VERSE #5: 31 Verses [Surah Ar-Rahman 55 : Verses 13, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73,75, 76]

فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ Fabi-ayyi ala-i rabbikumatukaththiban

So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? [Click here for audio]

Reflection Both the pronoun ‘your’ and the verb ‘will ye deny’ are in the Arabic in the dual number. The whole surah is a symphony of duality which leads to unity. All creation is in pairs. Justice is the conciliation of two opposites to unity, the settlement of the unending feud between right and wrong. The things and concepts mentioned in the surah are in pairs; man and outer nature; sun and moon; herbs and trees; heaven and earth; fruit and corn; human food and fodder for cattle; and so on throughout the surah. Then there is man and jinn.

‘Will ye deny?’ That is, fail to acknowledge either in word or thought or in your conduct. If you misuse Allah’s gifts or ignore them, that is equivalent to ingratitude or denial or refusal to profit by His infinite grace.

VERSE #6: 12 Verses [Surah Mursalat 77: Verses 15, 19, 24, 28, 34, 37, 40,4 5, 47, 49] [Surah Mutaffifin 83:10] & [Surah At-Tur 52: Verse 11]

[Surah Mursalat 77: Verses 15, 19, 24, 28, 34, 37, 40,4 5, 47, 49] [Surah Mutaffifin 83:10]

وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِلْمُكَذِّبِينَ Waylun yawma-ithin lilmukaththibeen

Woe, that Day, to the deniers.

[Click here for audio]

With a slight difference [Surah At-Tur 52: Verse 11]

فَوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِلْمُكَذِّبِينَ Fawaylun yawma-ithin lilmukaththibeen

Then woe, that Day, to the deniers,

[Click here for audio]

Reflection That day will be the day of woe to the wrong doers or rebels against Allah and his Truth described in two aspects and a day of joy and thanksgiving to the righteous, who are described in three aspects in verses 17 and 28. The rebels are described as being those who openly defy truth and plunged into wrong doing or who jested with serious matters. They were also those who did not have the courage to plunge openly into wrongdoing but who secretly indulged it. They were also those who wasted their life in doubt and petty quibbles. It is difficult to say which attitude did more harm to themselves and to others. However, the mercy of Allah is open to all if they repent.

VERSE #7: 8 Verses [Surah Ash-Shu-ara 26: Verses 9, 68, 104, 122, 140,1 59, 175, 191]

وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ Wa-inna rabbaka lahuwa alAAazeezu arraheem

And indeed, your Lord — He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.

[Click here for audio]

Reflection One who is able to carry out his will and plans. And verily your Lord, He is truly The All-Mighty means, the One Who has power over all things, to subdue and control them. ‘The Most Merciful’ means, towards His creation, for He does not hasten to punish the one who sins, but He gives him time to repent, and if he does not, then He seizes him with a mighty punishment. Abu Al-Aliyah, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Ishaq said: ‘He is Almighty in His punishment of those who went against His commands and worshipped others besides Him.’ Sa`id bin Jubayr said: ‘He is Most Merciful towards those who repent to Him and turn to Him.’

VERSE #8: 2 Verses [Surah Waqi’ah 56: Verses 9, 41]

Misconceptions of Black Magic and Jinn Possession (Part 1),"Black Magic! Jinn Possession! These are terms which spontaneously roll off people’s tongues when countering supernatural or unexplainable situations. Muslims (especially those from more traditional cultures) can be quick to attribute mental illness to Jinn possession. It is indeed possible for Jinn to possess humans, but it must be known that this is extremely rare. In the vast majority of cases, mental health illnesses are natural and not the result of Jinn. Therefore, we must avoid jumping to the conclusion that everyone with a mental illness is possessed.

Certain mental illnesses such as depression and hysteria can influence our thinking patterns and can make us see the very worst in a situation and jump to conclusions. Muslims with depression often become caught up in the idea that they are possessed or someone has done black magic on them and end up neglecting methods of treatment which would cure their depression. Likewise, hysterical disorders exemplify physical symptoms based on psychological causes resulting in similar symptoms to possession e.g. a rape victim will develop paralysed legs for the fear of being raped. Jumping to conclusions about black magic and jinn possession will cause more trouble than good and waste time in seeking the right treatment that will actually help a person.

It is best to rule out other possibilities before worrying about Sihr. You should always start from the basis that you are not possessed and that your illness is a natural phenomenon. If you start always from this foundation and pursue the relevant treatments then your illness will most certainly be cured. Being consumed with thoughts of possession is very distressing and will only serve to make you feel worse. The same approach that you would take with a physical illness is to be taken with mental health: approach it from both a medical and religious perspective. Do not abandon one for the other. This is the teaching of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and of the Qur’an. The Propeht (peace be upon him) said:

“Strive to pursue that which will benefit you and seek refuge with Allah, and do not feel helpless.”

In order to understand and handle jinn possession, black magic or even evil eye, we must be aware of what they are and their realities. Only a handful of people such as ignorant philosophers, doctors or those who have no knowledge of jinns deny their existence. Majority of people believe in jinns but their beliefs vary depending on their culture, individual nature and level of knowledge. Many believe jinns can be seen and can take the form of animals such as snakes, dogs, cats etc. They can even take the shape of a human, though their feet remain in the form of a goat. Others claim that the jinn’s kryptonite is wolves. Apparently wolves have the power to overcome jinns and that jinns fear them. Jinns also have the ability to live for thousands of years and know the unseen. Some of these claims may be true whilst others may not be. These beliefs need to be weighed up against the Quran and Sunnah in order to identify what is acceptable and what is not. Firstly, we need to realise what Jinns are. Jinns are creatures of Allah created before mankind from smokeless flame of fire.

“And the jinn: He created from a smokeless flame of fire.” (Qur’an 55:15)

They have some characteristics similar to humans such as thinking, reflecting and reproducing, but due to their origins they are hidden from human sight. They have the ability to possess a human body, inflicting pain and suffering such as psychological and nervous diseases (insanity, depression, anxiety, tension, and epilepsy), personality disorder, physical sickness, hallucinations etc as the Prophet S.A.W said:

“The Shaytaan flows through the son of Adam like his blood.” (Bukhari and Muslim)

There were other cases to prove jinns can possess a human body. It is reported that the Prophet met a boy who was possessed. So the he began saying, “Come out, O enemy of Allah. Come out, O enemy of Allah” after which the boy healed and became normal (Ibn Majah no.3548).

However, it is not easy for a jinn to possess a human body and cause physical harm because he will be exposing himself to punishment by means of the Quran. Even when they take form of other creatures, they are subjected to the same rules which apply to that creature. So if a jinn takes the form of a snake and you kill it, then he will be killed, as mentioned in several ahadith of the prophet in Bukhari and Muslim. For this reason jinns won’t harm humans unless they are positive that he/she is negligent in remembering Allah and is far away from deen. Still, we must remember that there aren’t any hard and fast rules about how or why jinns possess or harm humans and cases may differ from another. Some examples of why jinns may harm humans may be: simply because the jinn is bad and wants to wrongfully harm humans, for no purpose, just as normal foolish humans would. It could be (and there have been cases) that a jinn falls in love with a human and desires him/her so the jinn possesses him/her. Sometimes jinns would punish humans as a consequence of their actions i.e. a person may cause trouble to a jinn unintentionally by falling on him, throwing something at him, urinating on him etc, so the jinn punishes him more than he deserves.

Witchcraft and sorcery are also common ways to manipulate jinns into afflicting harm on people, especially in our Asian community. There is no denying that regions such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh dwell heavily in the art of black magic. So, what is black magic? In a nutshell, it is the use of negative energy and powers, summoning devils and shayateen (plural of shaytan) by evil minded people who are dedicated to harm or deprive others from living peaceful lives through sickening means. Black magicians would generally summon evil spirits by performing sacrificial rituals of humans or animals, depending on the severity of the magic. Once they acquire control over the spirit they are able to cause chaos in any aspect of people’s lives whether it is wealth, career, unexplainable health problems, family problems/tensions, mental illnesses, marriage problems, abnormal behaviour and in extreme cases; death. They experience an evil kind satisfaction at the expense of others hardship. Such horrid people are generally driven towards this sickening act due to jealousy, greed, selfishness, negativity and the inability to acknowledge other’s happiness and growth. This really is a huge problem in our society and unfortunately it has escalated in the last few years. The worst thing about it is that the main suspects are usually relatives, close friends, associates and even siblings (This is not always the case, but generally in Asian communities this is how it is). There are serious consequences for those who dwell in black magic such as coming out of the fold of Islam as the Prophet S.A.W mentioned:",https://medium.com/inspirited-minds/misconceptions-of-black-magic-and-jinn-possession-part-1-9d1c7c1899ec,['Inspirited Minds'],2015-12-07 21:57:20.548000+00:00,"['Islam', 'Mental Health', 'Muslim']"
Basketball Stories That Have Almost Nothing To Do With Basketball,"Freshman year we were blowing out a team, so they put the scrubs — me — in the game. For some reason, the other team continued to intentionally foul. I just happened to have the ball every time they fouled, so I ended up taking twelve free throws in just a couple minutes. I made eight of them, and considering a few years before I’d only scored eight points the entire season, this was one of the most prolific games of my career.

Immediately after the game, my mom drove me to visit my sister at college by myself for the first time. It was also the first time I drank alcohol.

“If Mom asks what we did, tell her we saw a movie,” my sister told me after Mom drove away. She was on the diving team and wasn’t supposed to drink during “dry season.”

“What movie did we see?” I asked, already paranoid about an interrogation.

“I don’t know. Big Fish.”

Then about a dozen of us crammed into someone’s dorm room, and I had four Coronas and an entire bottle of Boone’s Farm Melon Ball, which I haven’t consumed — or even seen — since that night. On a trip from the dorm room to the bathroom, I passed out on the floor. The next day I swore to myself I’d never drink again. My mom drove me home and never asked what we did. A decade later I saw Big Fish and loved it.",https://humanparts.medium.com/basketball-stories-that-have-almost-nothing-to-do-with-basketball-2955fa829d9c,['Ben Kassoy'],2015-09-10 15:28:28.210000+00:00,"['Storytelling', 'Humor', 'Sports']"
What Do You Know Review,"Firstly, mashAllah! Secondly, Alhamdulillah! Thirdly, wow! Leyla Habebti travelled to Norwich on Saturday with intentions to deliver a talk on awareness of Mental Health, and her personal experiences. Not only did she do that, but she also brought about a sense of connection. Leyla told the small community of ladies in Norwich about her own story and battles, and she emphasised “everyone has a story to tell” — we all knew this, and it suddenly dawned on us, that yes, we all do have a story. Whether we say it out loud or not, we all have a story, and this brought about a stronger connection than just sisters in Islam, we became sisters with stories.

Everyone came to a mutual understanding that mental health is a sensitive topic, but it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t speak about it — or totally push it out of the way because we haven’t got the exact answers or solutions, but be brought to the forefront and taken with awareness. When good and positive company was mentioned, I couldn’t help but think of the hadith that mentions a person is on the religion of their friends — and this probably had the most impact on the young teenage girls who I later overheard say “I’m glad you would understand if I was to ever come to you with a problem”, so we can definitely say that Leyla exceeded her intentions. After making it clear how common mental health problems are, we all realised that we are not alone. We no longer felt like strangers to one another, but sensed some sort of deeper understanding of one another.

I noticed that a few sisters exchanged meaningful glances as if they were saying with their eyes “we have some talking to do”, or smiling with their slightly teary eyes as if to say “I know, and I am here”. The talk made many sisters emotional, and lots of tissues were handed round, some shared their stories out loud, whilst others spoke to Leyla at the end and reached out for help. Many sisters were eager to ask questions on how to deal with friends with mental health but were unaware of their situation, or help friends who keep putting themselves down, to how to speak out about it and bring themselves back up — even after the talk ended, and food was being served, Leyla had a queue of sisters waiting to ask her something. MashAllah the talk was successful in educating, caring, and connecting, Alhamdulillah the talk brought us all closer together and more aware, and most importantly, we’ve just made another community active on empowering and putting mental health first.",https://medium.com/inspirited-minds/what-do-you-know-review-a278def989c5,['Inspirited Minds'],2015-12-06 00:46:14.183000+00:00,"['Islam', 'Mental Health', 'Depression']"
The anatomy of a credit card form,"Paying for something online with a credit card is simple, right? Yes and no. Yes, because we’ve been doing it since the early days of the Internet (e.g. Amazon), and no, because no two credit card forms are alike.

Over the past 20 years, we’ve built a mental model of paying online: I pull out a credit card from my wallet, enter the card details into a web form, and click a submit button. But getting from A to Z can be a tricky journey, riddled with questions the user has to answer. And obviously, nobody wants an instruction manual.

Credit card forms from various popular websites and apps.

Paying for something online is still 2–3x clunkier than paying in-person. Nothing beats tapping/swiping your card at a physical terminal. Zero typing required. You don’t even care about the information printed on your card. In a magical world, you could tap your card on your monitor to buy a swag new T-shirt from your favourite band. Or get rid of physical cards altogether, so you don’t have to pull out a card from you wallet. We’ve made significant progress in the physical world with Apple Pay.

Online, we’re getting closer. Paying online will become easier, and faster. The latest HTML spec includes specifications for credit card inputs, and browsers are pushing the boundaries. Chrome 42+ supports autocomplete. Safari supports credit card autofill. But you still need a physical card to manually input your security code with every transaction.

But before credit card forms become a thing of the past, we still have the present-day task of adding clarity, simplicity, and security to the credit card form.

At Wave, our Invoice product enables business owners to create and send invoices to their customers, and to have those invoices paid via credit card. My job was to design the credit card form, given a set of business requirements and constraints. This post is about the design considerations our team explored to arrive at the finished product.

The Wave credit card form

Our goal was to make sense of all the various inputs and questions a user may have, including:

What payment cards are accepted? Deciding how much to pay Name on card Card number Card type being used Expiry date Security code Why is there a ZIP code? Is this form safe and secure? What happens when I click submit? Handling card errors Designing for different screens

1. WHAT PAYMENT CARDS ARE ACCEPTED?

When the customer is presented with the credit card form, one of their first questions is “Is my credit card accepted”? This behaviour is the virtual equivalent of the physical-world scenario. When you’re at a physical counter ready to pay, you look for stickers to indicate the cards supported. So the common way to answer the question is by using credit card logos.

But, where do you place the logos on a web form? At first we tried to place them above the card number field. This placement reduces the height of the form, but the cards are small and look squished. Another option was to place them inside the input. This almost worked, but because we have a narrow input field, the cards took up too much space, overpowering the input. We decided to place the credit card logos at the top of the form. This placement makes them immediately visible, because they are the first element a user has to parse visually. The user doesn’t have to search for them. And they promptly call attention to themselves with a “this is where you pay” message. We felt the logos alone were sufficient, so we did not add labels for “Cards accepted”, or “Pay with”.

2. DECIDING HOW MUCH TO PAY

One requirement we had to satisfy was allowing the user to decide how much to pay. For large invoices, a customer may need to make a partial payment (e.g. a deposit), or pay the invoice with multiple payments as the work is completed. By default, the payment amount equals the total unpaid invoice amount. In other words, if a partial payment has been made, the payment amount equals the balance owed.

With web forms, we know that more inputs lead to lower completion rates, and higher bounce rates. To reduce the number of inputs, we show the payment amount in a read-only format, with a button to edit it, instead of displaying the text input by default. In edit mode, we considered having a Save or Done button, that would flip the input back to read-only. But we felt this was unnecessary, since the amount is already visible inside the input. Also, if the customer wanted to edit the amount again, they could simply change the input value, without having to deal with Edit/Done buttons.

We also wanted to confirm the payment amount when the user is ready to submit the form. A confirmation reassures the user of the amount that will be charged to their credit card. We display the payment amount inside the Pay button, at the bottom of the form. This amount updates synchronously with the amount entered in the payment amount input.

3. NAME ON CARD

The next thing we ask the user to provide is the name of the credit card owner. We considered several options for the label text:

Name of card holder

Card holder name

Name on card

Name (as it appears on your card)

Full name on card

We felt that Name on card was the shortest and clearest way to ask for this input. This asks the user to simply type exactly what’s displayed on the card, instead of thinking about the card owner’s full or abbreviated name.

4. CARD NUMBER

When reaching the card number input, a common question that a user asks is: “My card number has spaces. Do I enter my card number with spaces, or without?” To solve for this, we limit the input values to numbers only, so 0–9. So if a user types a space, it does not register and it does not affect the number format.

At first, we wanted to mask the card number when the user leaves the input. This was an attempt to provide the user with a sense of security, similar to how password fields are masked. But we realized that the credit card number is not a “secret”. You can’t do much with just a card number. Furthermore, when a user is ready to submit the form, they may want to double-check their inputs for accuracy. A masked field would break the visual review of the form because the user would have to put the focus back on the card input to reveal its value.

5. CARD TYPE BEING USED

A helpful pattern we noticed in other payment forms is to indicate the card type being used in a visual way. This reassures the user that the card type input matches the card they are holding in their hand. We can determine the card type from the starting first number, as follows:

3 — Travel/entertainment cards (e.g. American Express and Diners Club)

4 — Visa

5 — MasterCard

6 — Discover Card

After the user enters the first two numbers, we display a card logo inside the input field, floated to the right.

Of course, we could’ve done this differently, based on our designs from question 1:

Dim out the credit card logos at the top of the form. But because the logos are placed away from the number input, the correlation would not be clear.

Place all the credit card logos inside the number input by default, then as the user types in the first two numbers, all the card logos disappears except for the one that corresponds to the input.

6. EXPIRY DATE

Most credit cards display their expiry dates in the format MM/YY (month and year). Some may include the full year, in an YYYY format. When designing the expiry date input, we wanted to keep the user in typing mode to speed their input. The user does not have to reach for a mouse to pick a date and year from a select menu, or navigate the options via up/down arrows. The user simply has to type in the numbers as they appear on the credit card. This also prevents the user from having to think of the actual month (e.g. 08 is August), so cognitive load is minimized.

Because this input requires a particular format for the date, we included placeholder text inside the input. Note that the placeholder text includes a “/”, but this is not required to be typed by the user. We limit the input value to numbers only, so if a user does type a forward slash, it is not registered. After the month is entered, the slash is automatically appended.

7. SECURITY CODE

The card security code was invented to reduce credit card fraud. In other words, it’s meant to make cards more secure. The problem is that this code suffers severely from non-standardized naming. What should we call it? Every card brand has its own naming convention:

MasterCard — card validation code (“CVC2”)

Visa — card verification value (“CVV2”)

Discover — card identification number (“CID”)

American Express — “CID” or “unique card code”

Debit Card — “CSC” or “card security code”

And there are even more permutations:

Card verification data

Card verification number

Card verification code

Card code verification

Nuts, right? Acronyms create confusion. We wanted to stay away from them, but still indicate to the user that this code is all about security. So we decided to name this input “Security code”.

Next, a security code can be 4 digits (American Express, on the front of the card) or 3 digits (every other brand, on the back of the card). To help the user determine which code they need to enter, and where to find it, we included a visual tooltip. The tooltip has 3 states:

Dual code: If the user has not yet entered a card number, the tooltip shows both options available. 4-digit code: If the user has entered an American Express card, the tooltip indicates a 4-digit code on the front. 3-digit code: If the user has entered any other card, the tooltip indicates a 3-digit code on the back.

8. ZIP CODE

As an extra security measure, we have to ask customers for the ZIP code associated with their card. There is a trade-off here: adding extra inputs to the form can increase bounce rates, but by adding it, our business is more secure and less prone to fraud.

We realized that users may enter the ZIP code associated with their personal address, instead of the code associated with their cards. To add clarity, we added a note in a tooltip, which asks for the code from the credit’s card billing address.

US zip codes contain only numbers, up to a maximum of 10 (ZIP + 4 FTW). In Canada, zip codes contain letters, and spaces too. We restricted the input field to a max character count of 10.

And because we had to satisfy naming conventions for both US and Canadian customers, the input label reads “ZIP/Postal code”.

9. IS THIS FORM SAFE AND SECURE?

When a user first skims a credit card form, they often ask themselves “Is this form secure? How do I trust the website behind this form? Are they just spoofing my card details?”. There are many ways you can reinforce security through design. Some options we considered included:

Place a lock icon inside the form header, next to “Pay Invoice”, but this felt weak and disconnected from the form inputs.

Place a lock icon inside the card number field, but the question became “Is only this input secure, or is the entire form secure?”.

Label the Pay button with text “Pay $1.00 securely”, but the text would not fit for large payment amounts.

Add a security badge below the form, but we felt badges distract from a clean aesthetic, and from the overall brand of the page. Also, users can’t tell two badges apart, so we scrapped the idea. Previous A/B tests also indicated no difference in conversion.

Given the existing mental model of paying with credit cards online, we felt the presence of one lock icon was sufficient. The design solution was to add a lock icon inside the Pay button. The position of the icon is key, because it reinforces security at the critical point: when you click Pay.

10. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I CLICK PAY?

Once the user is ready to pay, they click the Pay button. The button changes state to a pending/loading state, and the text reads “Sending…”. We make a server request, and assuming an error-free state, we display a success message.

11. HANDLING CARD ERRORS

One of the most important, and often unloved parts of web form design, is error handling. Yes, it can be tedious at times. Yes, there are endless ways to design errors. But when done right, error handling can turn an ambiguous interaction into a clear one.

There are two general categories of error validation in Internet software: (1) client-side and (2) server-side.

Client-side validation

Client-side errors are caught before a request is sent to to the server. These errors are typically caused by formatting errors in the data, or missing data.

To make things interesting, you can validate client-side input in different ways. Luckily, Luke Wroblewski wrote a great article explaining the After, While, and Before and While validation methods. We chose the After method based on Luke’s research, and our gut feelings. The After method displays an error message after the user has indicated that she is done answering a question by moving on to the next one. In other words, validating on “blur”. Also to keep in mind, the user is not “locked” into a field if there is an error. They can tab on their keyboard and move to the next input, and come back later to fix any errors shown.

These were our validation criteria for client-side errors:

All inputs, except Name on card and ZIP code, must contain numbers only (i.e. no letters or special characters)

Payment amount: Must be minimum $1

Card number: Length must be 16 numbers (15 for American Express), must begin with one of the four known card codes

Expiry date: Length must be 2 numbers for month, and 2 for the year (i.e. MMYY). Month can only be 01 to 12, year must be minimum 15.

Security code: Length must be 4 numbers if American Express, or 3 numbers for other card brands

ZIP code: Length must be minimum 5 characters, maximum 10 characters

To visually indicate an error, we highlight the input field containing the error with red background and red border. We don’t make the input text red. As for the error hint, we display it below the error field, in red text.

Server-side validation

Server-side errors are caught after a request is sent to the server. They can be system-specific, or specific to the object being validated. In our form, we had to account for three types of server errors:

Invalid data, including card number, expiry date, security code, or ZIP code (e.g. expired card, invalid postal code) System errors, for when there is a problem with the server (e.g. timeouts, lost connection) Card errors, for when the card being used has been declined by the payment network for some reason (and there are literally hundreds of reasons)

In the case of a system error, we leave the fields populated so that a user can retry the payment. When a card is declined (i.e. card error), this is usually a smell for fraud, so we clear the data entered by the user.

12. DESIGNING FOR DIFFERENT SCREENS

From the start, we knew that we wanted to build one form that could be used on different screen sizes (i.e. responsive), and different screens (i.e. inside the Wave iPhone app). By using a singular form object, we only have to make changes to the form in one place. We don’t have to maintain multiple code bases.

Inside the Invoice by Wave iPhone app, we initially implemented a native credit card form, that was based on the single line input design pattern. The input was functional, but slightly buggy. More importantly, we perceived a poor experience with the way this input display labels, and the way a user has to navigate between inputs if there are errors present.

Now, using an HTML iFrame, we inject the new credit card form inside the app. Users have a near identical payment experience when entering their credit card details on a desktop browser, or inside the app. In the future, inside our iPhone app, we will style the form elements using CSS to match the design of other forms inside the app.

And there you have it, the anatomy of a credit card form! We’ve reviewed everything from copy, form input design, error handling, and mobile. Our credit card form will definitely evolve over time, so stay tuned for news. The payments space is not exactly sexy, but learning and understanding the user interactions behind accepting a credit card payment was really fun.

Now, time for a demo!

Still Feelin’ Alive at 25(K): My NaNoWriMo Halfway Mark,"Having never participated in NaNoWriMo before, I had no clue what writing 25,000 words felt like or if I could even do it. In my last post, I had proudly survived my first week, hit 10,000 words and quickly figured out this stuff is for real not easy. And thanks to my amazing writing buddy, Martina, who has kept my ass in gear, I can happily report that I broke the 25,000 mark like a champ. Here are a few realizations I’ve learned by reaching the halfway mark of my writing journey.

Character inspiration is awesome.

Have a real-life nemesis that you would love to see go down in the worst kind of way? Make them your inspiration for your story’s evil villan! Need a name for a sweet, old woman who bakes cookies for the little town orphans? Name her after your gold-hearted grandmother whose makes the most delicious snickerdoodles of all time. Find your inner Taylor Swift and instead of writing songs about ex’s or people, be sneaky and incorporate them in your story.

Keep reality alive in fiction.

Weave in real-life events into your story, such as historical milestones, modern day conflicts and important eras in pop culture. These will keep your story more grounded and interesting for you to craft plot lines around. It also adds a very realistic tone to your story that will help your reader connect with your fictional storyline.

I’ve surprised the hell out of myself.

Looking back, my story seemed so simple and not nearly as interesting then when I first started. There are days when I’ve definitely struggled and the words just haven’t flowed. Some days I would have much rather slept in a few extra hours rather than guzzle down a pot of coffee before 6 a.m. But I’m thanking myself for stayed relatively disciplined. Now, my story has taken on a life of its own and is becoming way bigger and better than I ever could have imagined — all because I just started typing.

Technology and The Evolution of Storytelling,"It is such an exciting time to be a filmmaker.

I do not believe the notion that the cinema is dying or dead because it’s amazing what technology can do to the cinematic storytelling.

What’s great about film is it constantly reinvents itself. It started as a sheer novelty, those images moving on the screen.

Then it went and every step of the way a new technology started being added — sound, color.

What happens is the film grammar of storytelling evolves and changes as well. The technology goes directly with the evolution of the storytelling.

The way films look —it started with old 35mm motion picture cameras, to color with the three-strip Technicolor, to cameras that weighed hundreds of pounds and had to be on dollies and cranes — that was the film grammar of the day.

The limitations of the technology being used to shoot the films set up what we’ve learned as film grammar.

Then, we came to lighter cameras, to handheld cameras, steady cams, and on and on, all the way down to now.

There’s a unique thing to a GoPro.

There’s a unique thing to an iPhone — the way things are shot and the way it’s held. It just gives it a vibrancy you’ve never been able to have before.

I believe new film grammar is going to come from these things.

It evolves, it changes, and it’s in great part because of the technology.

Walt Disney in 1939 receiving one Oscar statuette and seven miniature statuettes from Shirley Temple for “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”

In my own field, in animation, a seminal film in the history of animation is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Walt Disney’s first feature-length film.

People thought Walt was insane.

“People aren’t going to sit still for a feature-length cartoon. Are you nuts?”

But Walt was a visionary.

Walt saw beyond what people were used to. They were used to the short cartoon.

It’s interesting how people cannot see beyond what they’re used to.

There’s a famous statement by Henry Ford that before the Model T if you asked people what they wanted, they would say, “A faster horse.”

My own partner at Pixar for 25 years, Steve Jobs, never liked market research. Never did market research for anything.

He said, “It’s not the audience’s job to tell us what they want in the future, it’s for us to tell them what they want in the future.”

If you use technology correctly, you can change opinions overnight.

There’s a great statement I love. It’s that you only get one chance to make a first impression.

First impressions are nearly impossible to get people off of if they have the wrong impression.

I remember when I first saw computer animation. It wasn’t being used for much at the time. It was really geometric, sterile and cold, but I was blown away by it. Not by what I was seeing, but the potential I saw in it.

It was true three dimensionality with a control that we had in hand-drawn animation. I saw the potential in computer animation and was like, “This is great. Everybody, can you see this?”

But everybody was saying, “It looks like… It’s too sterile. No, I don’t like it.”

I realized they were judging from exactly what they were seeing.

People always push back saying, “It’s too cold, too sterile.”

In the early days of computer graphics, it found its way into special effects.

There were some people who didn’t understand the medium and thought it could do everything. There was this company that tried when they were making a movie called Something Wicked This Way Comes.

They had worked on Tron, did some effects, and they had a very charismatic effects guy that convinced them they could create this magical circus that would erect itself — this evil circus comes to town.

Disney bought in on it and they worked for a very long time. I had a very dear friend working on it.

It was way beyond what the computer could do at that time. They ended up cutting the entire sequence out of the film.

That set back computer graphics in the effects world years, because everybody remembered that experience.

It was because people didn’t understand what the technology could do.

About six years after that I was working at Lucas Film’s computer division and Dennis Muren, the brilliant Dennis Muren, Effects Director at ILM, came over to me and said, “We have this effect in a film called Young Sherlock Holmes, and we don’t know how to do it. I’m thinking computer graphics.”

It was only six shots. We said, “Let’s try it.”

It was some of the hardest things we ever did, but I’ll never forget when it came out — the effects industry, people from all over the world, had no idea how it was done.

But it worked. It fit in there. It was nominated for an Oscar for best visual effects.

We were so excited. But it was focusing on understanding the technology and pushing it to places that we couldn’t.

The goal was to make the technology invisible.

When we became Pixar in 1986 and we started working towards our first feature film, I remembered all those projects. I was blessed by, number one, loving the medium of computer animation.

I was just so interested in it and working with the people who basically had invented much of computer animation and we were pushing it all along.

We really understood what the computer could and could not do.

Pixar co-founders Ed Catmull, Steve Jobs, and John Lasseter.

At that time when we rendered things, everything kind of looked plastic-y.

So we started thinking about a subject matter that lent itself to the medium at that time.

“Everything looks like plastic, so what if the characters were made of plastic? What if they were…toys?”

That’s one of the reasons why we leaned into toys becoming alive as a subject for our very first feature film, Toy Story.

It was about the toys that lent themselves to the medium at that time. We chose toys that worked for that.

In fact, it was better in CG than any other medium we could have done because we could make Buzz Lightyear feel like he was made of plastic and ball-and-socket joints and we had screws and scratches and decals and all this stuff you could not have done in any other medium.

When it came out, our main focus was not the technology.

What I was scared about was that people would be like, “Oh, it’s the first computer-animated feature film.”

We made sure Disney, and all around the world, didn’t sell it as “The First CG film.”

You sell it as a great motion picture, because that’s how we made it.

We focused on the story and hiding the technology.

It came out and people loved it. You watch it today and it’s just as entertaining as the day it came out.

Woody and Buzz in the original “Toy Story”

Like I said, you’ve only got one chance to make a first impression.

Unlike Something Wicked This Way Comes, Toy Story was the number one film of the year it came out.

It was a huge hit and everybody started looking at this as a viable filmmaking medium.

Overnight, the opinion changed. Because the technology was used in the right way, telling the right story.

Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favorite filmmakers and one of the reasons why I’ve studied and admired his films is that guy used new technology in incredible ways, but it was completely invisible in everything he made.

You study his films and realize there’s no way he could have made that film, that shot, without that technology.

But he didn’t want you to notice it.

We focus on entertaining people in new ways, and if you focus on the technology too much you get caught up.

It’s not the technology that entertains people, it’s what you do with the technology.

It’s important, I believe, to make the technology invisible, but have it push to do something new.

That’s when you make real breakthroughs.

If you love a technology, if you really, really, really, really love a technology, then dig into it.

Learn as much as you can. It’s fun. That’s what I did with CG.

I was trained by these great Disney artists. I drew. It was all about story, character drawing, all that stuff, but when I got into computer graphics I was like, “Oh, my god, this is so much fun.”

I wanted to learn as much as I could.

The more you dig into the technology and the more you learn it, you are going to get ideas you would never have thought of without knowing your technology.

The kind of shots you can get from an iPhone that you cannot get with any other camera. Use it.

GoPros: use it. Be inspired by it.

Try things. It’s digital. Get another memory card, for God’s sake.

You will start creating ideas that lend themselves to these things and start looking new.

When you start doing something that’s truly new you will hear, “It’s not going to work.”

Walt Disney heard it. I heard it with CG.

“ Computer animation is so cold.”

Really? No, I don’t think so.

You think about it, it’s true for color, sound, feature length animation, CG.

The first feature film shot on an iPhone? “That’s not going to work.”

Yeah, it’s going to work. It’s going to be awesome.

The first feature shot with a GoPro? It’s going to be awesome in the hands of the right people.

The reason why they say this is because it’s not what people are used to.

Before the Model T, you ask people what they want and they’re going to want a faster horse. It’s not what they’re used to.

When I started working with CG, I could not wait for the tools to become commonplace.

In the early days, when SIGGRAPH was the only place you could go and see computer graphics, it was always fun. Everybody would cheer for reflective clear balls floating over a checkerboard and be amazed by it.

It was in a world where all of the art and the CG was being created by the guys who were writing the program.

There was no such thing as off-the-shelf software. There were no tools available.

They were writing their software and then creating it, and they were kind of the artistic guys within the computer world.

They were just showing off the technology. I kept thinking to myself, “Yeah, but they’re really ugly. This is like boring. Let’s entertain people.”

I couldn’t wait because I always viewed the technology as simply a tool.

Can you imagine the guy who invented the pencil and all of the things that that invention has brought the world?

That’s what I was feeling like with CG.

I couldn’t wait to get it in the hands of everybody to see what they would do.

The mediums we use are simply tools for expressing your art.

Your goal as a filmmaker is to entertain. And to entertain people is about story.

It’s about characters.

It’s about connecting with that audience.

It’s making that connection where you really deeply entertain an audience.

But it’s not just an art form that we’re in. It’s a business. Entertaining stuff simply just does better.

If you can make people laugh, cry and feel things with a film you make, you will be successful.

No matter what medium, any way you’ve distributed it — it all comes down to your knowledge skills.

What makes a good story? How can I tell it properly?

People get so excited about new technologies. I’ve had the question so many times from young people, “What software should I use?”

You know what? In your lifetime the software and the technology will change so drastically, it doesn’t matter.

What matters is when you’re young, you get excited about learning the fundamentals.

It sounds so boring to young people when they can make a movie so quickly and release it to the world and get millions of Likes.

“It’s so boring. I know how to do that.”

Trust me, you don’t.

The fundamentals of good storytelling, the fundamentals of film grammar, even though it was made with old Mitchell cameras and stuff like that, learn it.

Learn the fundamentals of animation. Learn the fundamentals of physics and things like that, of basic color, basic design.

This is the foundation of the building of your career.

Then, as you get into new technology, you’ll know exactly what to do.

And your work will not be about the technology. It will be about connecting and entertaining people.

No matter the length of your film — 30 seconds, five minutes, 22 minutes, feature length — it needs a story. It needs a beginning, a middle and an end.

It needs to deeply connect with people.

There are big differences between storytelling at 30 seconds or a feature film. Big differences.

We did a series of short films in the beginning of Pixar and we did television commercials.

We were thinking the next step for us was to do a Christmas special, but Disney threw us in the deep end, and we developed a feature film.

It was amazing what we didn’t know.

But I went back to my traditional training I had learned from my mentors — Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and the great Disney animators that were still working at the studio when I started there — and the fundamentals of animation they kept talking about.

Ollie Johnston would turn to me and I was expecting something about arcs and lines and silhouette value and all that stuff.

He would turn and say, “John, what’s the character thinking?”

It was amazing to me, just that simple statement. It was not about the drawing.

It was never about the drawing to them. It was about that character and what it’s thinking.

Through pure movement they taught me to bring a character to life and give it an emotion, a personality, a uniqueness, and it was done through just pure motion.

So when I started working with a computer, I just brought that technology with me. As we started developing the story, it was always about emotion. It was always about emotion from day one with Toy Story.

It was about emotion, making you feel.

I’ve admired Walt Disney so much my whole life and part of it is because he entertained people like no other person in history has ever done. The way he makes you feel when you watch his movies, the way he makes you feel when go through that tunnel under the train station at Disneyland and you’re transported.

It’s about emotion and that connection.

Walt always said, “For every laugh, there should be a tear.”

It felt like that core emotion. That became the hallmark of what we tried to do at Pixar — to do it with the new technology.

I think the biggest thing for us is we studied films. We watched films religiously.

With Toy Story, it was a buddy picture. We watched every buddy picture we could find and analyzed it. Good ones, and it’s very important to watch bad ones too.

You start understanding what they did. Don’t copy things. It’s about understanding and learning.

Very, very, very important: Do not work in a vacuum.

You have to surround yourself with trusted people. You get so immersed in your work, you will not be able to see the forest from the trees. Frankly, you’ll be studying the pine needles and worrying about them.

You need someone to help you back up and take a look at the forest and see where things are working or not working.

And you need to surround yourself with people whose judgment you trust and they can be brutally honest with you.

As an artist, showing unfinished work to people is really difficult. It’s really hard. It always is hard. It always will be hard. It never gets any easier, but you have to do it.

Andrew Stanton, my creative partner at Pixar, has this fantastic phrase that I use all the time, “Be wrong as fast as you can.”

Trust me, when you go from an outline to a treatment, your first treatment sucks and you do revisions and talk to people and you get something working really great.

Go to your first draft of the script, it sucks. You do it a whole bunch of times.

For us, we go to story reels, the first story reel sucks. But the longer you say, “I’m not ready yet, give me a little more time, give me a little more time,” and like that, it’s not going to help the problem.

You’re just going to be polishing. You’re not going to see where it’s not working.

Get it up there. Throw it up there as fast as you can, talk about it, tear it back down, put it back up there. Keep doing this.

Surround yourself with people you trust.

Be thirsty for knowledge.

It will always make your work better. The market is changing really, really quickly.

Who knows what the business will look like ten years from now?

Writers of The Process,"Lucius Patenaude

Work:

I am a film director and writer currently living in Nashville, Tennessee. I freelance with local productions to support myself. I still have much to learn.

Passion:

Novels, film, animation, video games. I consume stories in any way, shape or form. I seek out stories to teach me more about the world I live in and challenge my beliefs. I especially love stories that explore the relationship between God and man. Most of my personal writing is high-concept fiction with abstract themes though I very much enjoy shooting documentaries about everyday people.

Tidbits:

My extended family is made up of scandinavians from Minnesota and pioneers that helped build Texas, so I’m basically a viking cowboy. Though born in Texas, I was grown in Northern Thailand and homeschooled through high school. My skills include cooking Thai food and firing Civil War-era cannons.

Most recommended movies: Sound of My Voice, Children of Men, Noah.

Work:

I’m a writer trained in advertising and public relations, but I have also dabbled in poetry, short stories, blogging and screenwriting. I currently reside in the beautiful city of Austin, where I’m working at a PR firm downtown and getting connected with the local film industry.

Passion:

I believe in the power of stories, whether they be in the form of books, music, poetry, graphic novels or film. My own stories tend to explore themes of faith and culture, two of the most significant aspects of my life. I want everything I write to be courageous, communicating unexpected truths about God, the world and myself. I’m also fascinated with the way social media is shaping our psychology and passionate about writing great characters in order to eradicate stereotypes.

Tidbits:

I’m a movie buff, global nomad, published poet, scrapbooker, sweet tooth and cat enthusiast. I can speak Thai, code in CSS & HTML, bake sourdough bread and write a killer thank you note. I’ve always wanted to go to Japan, but never have, and never wanted to go to India, but did a few summers ago. My happy place is somewhere between a beach and a bookstore. INFJ. Oh, and I’m proud to be Lucius Patenaude’s little sister.

Lauren Quigley

Work:

I graduated from Abilene Christian University with a Bachelor of Science in Nutrition, and minored in both Communication and Digital Entertainment Technology. I’m currently job hunting and doing freelance work in San Antonio, Texas.

Passion:

Writing, film, any and all media. Being captivated with a truly great story is one of my favorite feelings in the world, and I want to give that feeling to others through words and a camera. I believe in authenticity, asking questions that might not have answers, and shining light on the everyday experiences that make up life.

Tidbits:

I grew up in a family of six, was homeschooled through high school, and my first solid experience in creative writing was through Lord of the Rings and Pirates of the Caribbean fan fiction. I studied nutrition because I’ve always wanted to help people live long lives, I love food, and the human body is amazing. Sometimes I talk like Batman to make my husband laugh.

Emmy Sparks

Work:

I recently graduated with a biology degree and an ambiguous vision for the future. Currently, I work as an Administrative Assistant for a church, crossing off the last thing I ever wanted to try: being a secretary. I should probably make more life goals. I TA Anatomy and Physiology lab courses on the side, which means I literally have skeletons in my closet.

Passion:

Ice Cream.

Pizza.

I believe that there should not be so much animosity among religious people toward science, or vice versa. By nature, neither party can prove or disprove the other. In fact, what I have discovered so far is that science reveals that there is room for God, which I find exhilarating. There are so many things I want to say about this topic. I hope to do so soon. Also, I highly value child sponsorship, and sponsor two children through World Vision and Compassion International.

Tidbits:

Once upon a time I told my Nana that when I grew up I would be a writer in New York City. We’ll see.

I find joy in thinking about thoughts and cooking a lot of food for one person and another person (a note: I love him).

I have a goofy dog named Charlie because I needed something to save and he has a terrible case of sad puppy eyes. His Instagram is @charliestatus, because what stranger wouldn’t want to see pictures of my dog.

I slay dragons.

Work:

While I spent more time learning, studying, and playing music in college, my degree is actually in psychology (music minor). Saving the possible pursuit of graduate school for later years, I have moved to Nashville, TN as a solo artist and writer. Currently “starving” away as a waitress.

Passion:

People and that thing called Music. If I have any certainties in this life, they are to help and love people in any way I can, from newborns to the oldies. I happen to think music brings change and touches the soul in phenomenal ways, besides the fact that it is a universal language (ah!). I have a passion for serving, culture, for a world outside of my own, and for understanding each person as they are and how they became that way.

Tidbits:

I grew up in America, Japan, and Germany. Traveled extensively and don’t want to stop. Ever. Part of my heart’s been planted in Africa.

My family is extremely close, something of a rarity these days. Oh, I’m the youngest.

Photography and videography on the side.

Huge lover of art museums, forests, walking barefoot, English tea/tea time, ultimate frisbee.

I could say more.

Those days when I can sit at the piano and play, lose all sense of time and enter into my made up reality, created and shifted with every new note I play.

Brandy Rains

Work:

I have an Art Education degree but I don’t really know what that means. I am also currently pursuing a masters in Education, but I don’t know what that is, either. And because of that, I’ll be working for a non-profit in Nashville when I finish grad school.

Passion:

Being outdoors. I currently live in the mountains, so I suppose I have some sort of steel-like lung.

Writing poetry, rock climbing, reading, hiking, and drinking pretentious yet environmentally conscious fair-trade coffee.

Attempting to be humorous and most of the time failing miserably.

Tidbits:

I can’t tie a cherry stem with my tongue, but I CAN eat at least 32 grilled shrimp in one sitting, and I feel like that’s just as impressive.

I performed my first slam poem less than a year ago, and it made me a better person.

I imagine sometimes what it would be like to have enough abs to matter.

I’ve worked in social justice/non-profit longer than I’ve been attending college.

I am the first person in my family to graduate college.

I’m one of “those” people who tries to take Instagram seriously as a photographer.

Julia Curtis

Work:

Currently working on my English degree at Abilene Christian University. No, my plan is not to be a teacher, though who am I to decide my future.

Passion:

People, their stories, and what they do with them. This can be through books, movies, video games, and yes even television. I devour any form of a good story. I like making stories of my own, and being in other people’s stories through theater. I daydream about camping in the mountains and going to Hogwarts. God has blessed me with opportunities to travel, and travel I must.

Tidbits:

My homes have included the areas of California, Honduras, Japan, New Jersey, Arkansas, Ecuador, and Texas.

Food is everything. Seriously it keeps you alive.

I love people watching.

I have the greatest friends in the world.

I’m a Senior Digital Entertainment Technology student with minors in Graphic Design and Art, graduating in just a few months. I work as a Media Assistant, teaching software tutorials and helping students hurdle over blockades in their creative urges.

Passion:

Art, good food, and even better company. I’m of the opinion that there’s not much that can’t be bettered with a solid community of both peers and mentors (and a home cooked meal). Grad school will be coming for me within the next few years for Art History and Museum Studies.

Tidbits:

I am a professional whistler. There is nothing else that I claim such proficiency in.

National parks and museums are my second home.

I used to be a cashier, sneaker reseller, and financial aid dependent. Now, I take photos and shoot video on a freelance basis, while selling my soul writing words for ads or tech companies. Also an aspiring film director, lebenskünstler and sane person. Crosses fingers.

Passion:

On most nights, I’m either nerding out on movies, basketball, food, or camera gear. Fairly certain that I must be passionate about having life crises, too, if I keep putting myself through so many. So let’s include these: thinking about old flames, feeling older than I am, and suppressing my only-child syndrome. I like small, sentimental stories that feel big.

The House That Fish Built,"First, a list:

Now let’s rewind a bit.

In March 2012, Robin Sloan introduced us to a “short but heartfelt manifesto about the difference between liking something on the internet and loving something on the internet.” He called it “Fish: A Tap Essay.” As with all of Sloan’s work, the writing was fun and thought-provoking. The mode of delivery, meanwhile, felt both new and familiar.

Fish, in the wild

Sloan distributed Fish as a standalone iOS app which, when opened on your iPhone, forced you into landscape mode and asked you to tap the screen to move forward. With each tap, a new sentence or fragment of a sentence would appear, along with an accompanying visual (most often just a solid color background). By controlling the progressive reveal of information, Sloan managed to establish a cadence — something we generally associate with the spoken word, not the written one.

The constant variation also created an undercurrent of suspense. Tapping forward felt addictive and satisfying: What would he do/say next?

Me, the next day

Around the time Sloan published Fish, I had been wanting to move my explanatory storytelling studio towards a new visual medium. Newsbound had produced several video explainers earlier that year — on wonky subjects like the filibuster and the federal budget process. They had attracted healthy traffic, but our user testing had revealed a pacing problem. Everyone loved the accessible illustrations and animations, but more-informed viewers often complained that our narrator (yours truly) spoke too slowly. Newcomers to the subject matter felt the opposite — that it was too much information too fast.

I’d already entertained the idea of a self-paced, slideshow-esque format, but worried that requiring the user to continuously click or tap their way through a narrative might be too tedious. Then I found myself standing in line for a sandwich at Pal’s, happily tapping my way through Fish.

I was bewitched by this medium — and emboldened.

In the days that followed, I created a prototype in Keynote (a chronological explanation of the Trayvon Martin story). Using their iOS app, I could simulate the “tap-essay” experience on an iPhone. Over the next few weeks, we tested that prototype with a series of users. They took vastly different amounts of time to complete the explainer, but stuck with it nonetheless. Most of them complimented the format, telling us that they had “lost themselves” in the story and expressing surprise when we showed them a text-only print-out of the 1,500 words they had just consumed in bite-sized pieces. (“I would never read something that long!”)

The Newsbound team continued to refine the reading experience and started building our own web-based technology to power it. Around the same time, Sloan wrote an essay for Contents reminiscing about Hypercard stacks and predicting their triumphant return:

“We will start to make stacks in earnest again. We will develop a new grammar for this old format. We will talk about rhythm and reveals and tweetable cards. We will know how many cards an average person can tap through in one sitting. We will know when to use stacks…and when to just scroll on. Twenty-five years later, we will prove the hypertext researchers wrong: cards are pretty cool after all.”

When we published our first embeddable, public-facing explainer in this format (on the history of political conventions), we called it a “stack.” Internally, we started referring to our software as “Stacker.”

Newsbound has since published over 75 stacks — some of them original works, some client projects. Our embeddable player has appeared on the websites of The New York Times, The Washington Post, BoingBoing, The Atlantic, Upworthy, as well as in Bill and Melinda Gates’ annual letter.

Over this period, we’ve gathered granular analytics (all those clicks and taps are trackable, after all) and observed remarkable engagement rates. For instance, out of the 50,000 people who started reading this Gates Foundation stack on the history of international family planning, 65 percent finished it, spending 4–5 minutes on average. Over 80 percent completed this OZY stack on Iceland’s marriage norms. The minimum wage explainer we produced in tandem with KQED has been launched nearly one million times.

This year, we released Stacker as a platform to a beta group of writers and designers. They are now creating their own stacks and, every week, we are onboarding more people from the waiting list (which has grown to over 400).

About that new grammar …

Stacker is just one branch splintering away from Sloan’s Fish app. As the list above shows, we’re not alone. NPR’s visuals team, The New York Times, Facebook, CNN and others are experimenting with this medium as a way to tell certain stories. Each is approaching it with their own tenor and flavor. The techniques vary. But a common strain runs through it all.

In a blog post on Source dissecting his team’s approach to picture-driven content, NPR senior interaction designer Wes Lindamood categorizes pieces like Demolished as “sequential visual stories” and acknowledges Fish as a source of inspiration (along with the work of Scott McCloud and Frank Chimero).

He goes on to provide one of the best descriptions of the medium I’ve ever read:

“Sequential visual stories are self-paced experiences controlled through a minimal interface. Like a slideshow, ideas in sequential visual stories are presented in a linear and visual way — but unlike a slideshow, which treats the image as the dominant element, sequential visual stories mix multiple forms of media. A key advantage of this format is that it can direct a user’s focus in a way that will have editorial impact, without taking control away from users over the speed in which they experience the story. Through revealing moments over a sequence of screens, we can emphasize key ideas, offer surprise and juxtaposition. And because users have control over the amount of time the spend on each screen, they can linger on images and ideas that are most important to them.”

I can’t speak for the other outlets and companies experimenting with this medium, but at Newsbound we’ve still struggled with the “new grammar” that Sloan referred to back in 2012. While working on a stack, we sometimes refer to the atomic unit as a “frame,” other times as a “slide,” other times as a “click.” Lindamood apparently calls them “screens.” Before Betaworks shut down Tapestry (which allowed anyone to create a Fish-esque tap essay), they used the term “page.” And Sloan has called them “cards.”

When it comes to the broader label, we’ve noticed that “stack” doesn’t always … stick. Just look at the wide-ranging terms our readers use to describe our content:

“filmstrip”

“infographic”

“slideshow”

“interactive”

“powerpoint”

“deck”

“picture book”

Take a peek at the tweets emanating out from one of NPR’s sequential visual stories and you’ll see something similar happening, with references to “presentations,” “slide decks,” “slideshows,” etc.

Is this actually a problem?

I don’t know. I go back and forth on this question.

On the one hand, I believe this a powerful medium for all the reasons (and more) that Lindamood and Sloan lay out. I know there are certain subjects and certain readers for whom it is the ideal platform. I want to see it become as pervasive and familiar as the video or the infographic. And perhaps — perhaps! — if we had a common shorthand for this style of storytelling, adoption would spread faster.

On the other hand, I’m not sure you can force such a thing, no matter how hard you try.

Still, I’m interested to hear from the other writers, designers and developers experimenting in these waters or contemplating it. If the term “slideshow” were prohibited, how would you describe this medium to your boss, your loved ones, complete strangers? Leave a response below or email me at josh (at) newsbound (dot) com.

And if anyone has more examples of recently-published stories that fall into this bucket, please send them along (I’ll then update this post with a longer list).",https://medium.com/newsbound/the-house-that-fish-built-1cc10349ae8d,['Josh Kalven'],2015-05-09 17:23:55.410000+00:00,"['Publishing', 'Media', 'Storytelling']"
Genetic Data Tools Reveal How Pop Music Evolved In The US,"The history of pop music is rich in details, anecdotes, folk lore. And controversy. There is no shortage of debate over questions about the origin and influence of particular bands and musical styles.

But despite the keen interest in the evolution of pop music, there is little to back up most claims in the form of hard analytical evidence.

Today that changes thanks to the work of Matthias Mauch at Queen Mary University of London and a few pals who have used the number crunching techniques developed to understand genomic data to study the evolution of American pop music. These guys say they have found an objective way to categorise musical styles and to measure the way these styles change in popularity over time.

The team started with the complete list of US chart topping songs in the form of the US Billboard Hot 100 from 1960 to 2010. To analyse the music itself, they used 30-second segments of more than 80 per cent of these singles — a total of more than 17,000 songs.

They then analysed each segment for harmonic features such as chord changes and for the quality of timbre, whether guitar or piano or orchestra based, for example. In total, they rated each song in one of 8 different harmonic categories and one of 8 different timbre categories.

Mauch and co assumed that the specific combination of harmonic and timbre qualities determines the genre of music, whether rock, rap, country and so on. However, the standard definitions of music genres also capture non-musical features such as the age and ethnicity of the performers, as in classic rock or Korean pop and so on.

So the team used an algorithmic technique for finding clusters within networks of data to find objective categories of musical genre that depend only on the musical qualities. This technique threw up 13 separate styles of music.

An interesting question is what these styles represent. To find out, the team analysed the tags associated with each song on the Last-FM music discovery service. Using a technique from bioinformatics called enrichment analysis, they searched for tags that were more commonly associated with songs in each music style and then assumed that these gave a sense of the musical genres involved.

For example, they found that style 1 was associated with soul tags, style 2 with hip hop, style 3 with country music and easy listening, style 4 with jazz and blues and so on.

Finally, they plotted the popularity of each style over time.

The results make for fascinating reading. They found that the frequency of style 4 (jazz, blues etc) declined from 1960 onwards. Styles 5 and 13, which relate to rock music, fluctuate throughout this time. And style 2 (rap) is rare before 1980 but expands rapidly after that and becomes the dominant genre for the next 30 years before declining in the late 2000s.

The data allows them to settle some long standing debates among connoisseurs of popular music. One question is whether various practices in the music industry have led to a decline in the cultural variety of new music.

To study this issue, Mauch and co developed several measures of diversity and tracked how they changed over time. “We found that although all four evolve, two — diversity and disparity — show the most striking changes, both declining to a minimum around 1984, but then rebounding and increasing to a maximum in the early 2000s,” they say. Beyond that, their conclusion was clear. “We find no evidence for the progressive homogenisation of music in the charts,” they say.

Instead, they say that the evolution of music between 1960 and 2010 was largely constant but punctuated by periods of rapid change. “We identified three revolutions: a major one around 1991 and two smaller ones around 1964 and 1983,” they say.

The characters of these revolutions were all different with the 1964 revolution being the most complex. This consisted of an increase in popularity of styles 1, 5, 8, 12 and 13 which were enriched at the time for soul and rock-related tags. At the same time, styles 3 and 6 declined, enriched for tags such as doowop.

The 1983 revolution is associated with an increase in popularity of songs with tags such as new wave, disco and hard rock and a decline in soft rock and country tags.

The 1991 revolution is associated with the rise of rap-related tags.

Another question hotly debated by music commentators is how British bands such as the Beatles and The Rolling Stones influenced the American music scene in the early 1960s. Mauch and co are emphatic in their conclusion. “The British did not start the American revolution of 1964,” they say.

The team say the data clearly shows the revolution underway before The Beatles arrived in the States in 1964. However, British bands certainly rode the wave and played an important part in the way the revolution occurred.

That’s fascinating work. Because musicians copy, repeat and modify song styles they like, this leads to a clear pattern of evolution over time. So it should come as no surprise that techniques developed for the analysis of genetic data should work on music data as well. “The selective forces acting upon new songs are at least partly captured by their rise and fall through the ranks of the charts,” they say.

And there is much work to be done. Mauch and co point out that these number crunching techniques are quit general and so could be widely applied to cultural phenomenon, provided the data is available.

For the moment, they have their sights set on further music analysis. Their next task is to gather data going further back in time. “We are interested in extending the temporal range of our sample to at least the 1940s — if only to see whether 1955 was, as many have claimed, the birth date of Rock’n’Roll,” they say.

Worth waiting to find out!

What’s Important Is Feeling,"Story me short, summer 2k15. Here are six of the best new short story collections — silent mixtapes for those pockets of downtime between eating, beaching and sleeping.

1. What’s Important Is Feeling by Adam Wilson

No one knows who slept with her first. Besides, sleep isn’t the right word. What we did: pressed lips to closed lips, tried to slip in some tongue; buried her beneath us on carpeted floors and futon mattresses; felt her dry skin against our sweat-wet hands; said, “Don’t cry”; wiped tears with our T-shirts; kept on because she said, “Don’t stop.”

So raw, so good. A boy works at a suburban diner, falls in love with a girl who plays with her pancakes, and invites her into his (embarrassingly bad) band. He grows weed with a friend — “a weakling of a plant that turned out to be male and unharvestable” — and talks about girls. In another story, a homeless man breaks into a college apartment and begins to cry. These stories are vulgar, young, and tinted with Instagram’s Nashville filter. Most are told in first person, by narrators under thirty. Summer reading, definitely. Porches, dead time, and soft thunder. It’s impossible for me to describe just how good these are. I was up all night.

2. Can’t and Won’t by Lydia Davis

When I fell asleep, I dreamed about the guillotine; the strange thing was that my little niece, who sleeps downstairs, also dreamed about a guillotine, though I hadn’t said anything to her about it. I wonder if thoughts are fluid, and flow downward, from one person to another, within the same house.

A reminder that it doesn’t take more than a sentence to make a story. Little drops of water in a bucket. Most of these stories are only a paragraph long, and some just a few sentences. Tiny fragments, a few of them poems. Together, they’re a catalog of thoughts — some are dreams (marked “dream” in tiny letters at the bottom). Lydia writes about the feeling of slogging through a bad novel, getting catfished, an eight-sentence story about a lazy bodyguard. The book also includes a few anecdotes based on letters by Flaubert, sprinkled in just for fun. This book is like a pointillist painting. The message is that everything is important.

3. Don’t Kiss Me by Lindsay Hunter

Back at his house he asks if I want to play Princess Leia and I am touched, I know he’d rather have her for a girlfriend than me, It’d be an honor, I tell him, and he hands me my lightsaber and then knocks it out of my hand with his. You’re dead cinnamon-bun dumb-hair, he says, looking up at me through his bangs, my hand is throbbing from where his lightsaber hit, again I die for him, I shudder and quake and cry out and fall at his feet and die. Now I’m going to maybe spit in your hair, you don’t know, keep your fat eyes closed, he says. Okay, I whisper.

WORD. MAGICK. Ugh, this book is very funny and totally unique. Strong characters say weird shit in those fat margin-to-margin paragraphs that make you want to stop breathing. These short, punchy stories experiment with form and voice, and they’re exhilarating, bordering on poetry. You’ll find all kinds of wacky here: a story about an apocalypse at P.F. Chang’s, an all-caps soliloquy about a candle shoppe, and a game of “Lips” where two girls touch lips until one of them screams. You will probably never be bored again in your life after these.

4. The Miniature Wife and other stories by Manuel Gonzales

To be honest with you, Jim, my face is unevenly shaved because my three-inch wife has climbed up the porcelain sink, hoisted herself up to the medicine cabinet, opened the heavy mirror door, and has dulled all of my razor blades.

What would happen if you were stuck on a hijacked plane for twenty years? What if loud, annoying noises gave you visible cuts and bruises? Check into these stories-slash-thought-experiments for some totally serious (but also insane) answers. Manuel’s stories are trippy: A scientist who works in “miniaturization” manages to unwittingly shrink his wife — she is no bigger than a coffee mug — and builds a dollhouse for her. A composer is paralyzed from the mouth down — he can’t speak with his mouth, so he teaches himself to speak through his ears. In each one, Manuel takes a tiny, ridiculous premise, and describes it with so much detail it becomes plausible. Like a lucid dream.

5. Making Nice by Matt Sumell

Thing is she didn’t think that pots and pans should go in the dishwasher, so I pointed out that there’s a setting on the dishwasher for pots and pans, just look, it’s right there, open your fuckin’ eyeballs. Well she didn’t like that very much and started in with this business about me being a loser and headed nowhere […] Either way it made me upset, and I slammed the refrigerator door so hard the milk exploded, then I turned around and told her to shut it or I’d punch her mustache off her face and watch it fly across the room like a hairy bug.

Say what you want about angsty male narrators who think in long curmudgeonly sentences, but this one is very funny. These stories are offensive, angry, hilarious and sad. Inhibitions are killed and left to rot. All of these stories are told by the same character, a thirty-year-old named Alby whose mother recently died of cancer. The callous jokes only make the poignant moments — Alby alone with his mother, in the hospital at home, emptying her piss bag or doing her nails — more heartfelt. Think: vulgar family jokes that are funny and sad at the same time.

6. We Live in Water by Jess Walter

Wayne eases the door closed, steps down the hall to the boys’ room. Little and Middle, nine and eleven, splayed on twin beds like they were dropped fifty feet. The Little one could be it out of temperament alone. He’s a hoarder, a brooder. Dark eyes like his mother. Looks up from his Legos like you interrupted church. Kid didn’t say a word until he was four and then it was a full sentence: “I want more applesauce now.”

These are the most tender stories you will read in your life. Stories about people who unravel and cry at the past. Most of these stories are told in close third person, and the protagonists are drunkards/cheats/divorcées with broken families and good intentions. Many weave their way back and forth between past and present, giving you clues as they go. The kind of book that pairs well with slow Billy Joel, or Dylan. Gotta be honest and say this is my favorite on this little list.",https://humanparts.medium.com/what-s-important-is-feeling-8dba150884e5,['Harris Sockel'],2015-06-07 02:43:24.200000+00:00,"['Books', 'Short Story', 'Fiction']"
Have we any empathy?,"As October slowly comes to an end, we can most certainly say that there is a lot more to “dignity” in mental health than what we once thought. Whether it’s through the way we physically respond to sufferers, or the way we differentiate between those in society, the most important thing that has been highlighted this month is that Allah has created us with dignity, and that gives us every right to remain dignified. Regardless of our mental and physical state. We’ve established the meaning of dignity, we’ve discovered the relationship between dignity and mental health, and last week we focused on the importance of treating those with mental health problems with dignity — but how do we do this?

It may seem self-explanatory, i.e. in order to help someone with a mental health problem, with dignity, you have to listen, give them time, be kind, and be patient etc, but that’s all a little bit cliché, isn’t it? It’s actually a little bit more complex than what we think. How often do we listen, give time, etc but in the back of our minds we’re still thinking, “Is this true? Does this even exist? Why don’t I experience it? Get real!”. These thoughts don’t just stay in the back of our minds either, they somehow creep their way to our faces and our expressions say it all. Our dipped eyebrows, tight lips and overly concerned eyes no longer have their sincerity, and it becomes obvious to the one receiving our “attention”. This doesn’t apply to everyone, of course. These thoughts might not occur because of culture, tradition and ignorance — rather because, we’ve lost a very important human character trait. We’ve lost empathy. We don’t have the ability to empathise, but we are pro’s to sympathise.

Just think for a second, when you’re going through a really rough time, and you’re sick of people looking at you differently and making you feel like an alien, would you want someone to feel sorry for you, or someone that attempts to share and understand your pain? We’ve hit the nail on the head. Respecting and honouring someone’s dignity is not achieved through “oh, you must be having a really hard time. Better days are to come”, it’s succeeded through, “I can only imagine what you’re going through, but I can see that it’s hard. I’ll never understand truly what it feels like, but it must be suffocating, right?”. Instead of burying someone with artificial ‘positivity’ and ‘optimism’, be real with them, I’m sure they would appreciate someone that is willing to take baby steps with them instead of sprinting ahead while they slug behind. There is also another classic approach, the prying, the constant questions, and the unnecessary checking up on. Does it even make sense to interrupt a person who has been longing to get something off their chest with “so, like… what does it feel like?”, or “man, are you sure you’re okay? You know, you don’t have to carry on, but are you okay?”, and the favourite, “so, when did this happen? Is that when this happened? Or did it happen because of this?” — just chill! Let the person come out with it all, then carefully think about your questions, don’t overwhelm someone who is already overwhelmed with their own questions and distorted thoughts. Remember, you’re not the one that is asking for help — hence why empathy is so important.

From my own experiences and observations, there is this ‘unofficial’ script that is said robotically to anyone who simply wants to talk, who simply wants a pair of real ears that are actually hearing what is being said rather than listening out for key words to match for a response, and the chances are, that person just wants someone to hear their silent screams. Any good doctor will tell you that even if someone receives counselling, advising, medication, social support and the best of every service out there — without dignity, respect and empathy, they are truly meaningless. As a basic human need, we want to be understood — so why is it so difficult to make that attempt with someone who has a mental health problem?

Having a mental health problem does not take away your dignity, your respect or honour. You deserve to be understood, cared for and apart of society as much as anyone else. Having a mental health problem does not take away your dignity, your respect or honour. It only adds substance to which you really are, the survivor that you are. Having a mental health problem does not take away your dignity, your respect or honour; but it makes you noble, inspirational and strong.

A Letter to Santa From A UXer,"Dear Santa,

I know you’re a real busy guy this time of year, what with all that toy making, but I hope you would spare a moment to hear a little constructive feedback on how to improve the user experience of Christmas.

Every year I mail my Christmas list to you (still haven’t got that hot dog roller, by the way) and I never have any idea if you’ve received my letter. If you have the ability to see me when I’m sleeping and know if I’ve been bad or good, at least send a delivery confirmation for goodness sake. How will I know if a full year’s worth of good behavior is even worth it if I don’t know if you’re receiving my list? Without the confirmation, it feels a little like I’m just mailing letters to some mythical being who wears a lot of red and is at risk for type II diabetes.

Also, how do I know if I am on the naughty or nice list? It’s 2015 Santa. A single year-end review is pretty antiquated. Routine performance reviews are the new standard. It would be nice if there was an app where I could track my behavior and list status. Perhaps complete with tips and improvement plans? I mean, banking has been online for 15 years Santa, what’s the holdup? Even a text every few months would go a long way. For example:

“Dear Nick,

Shape up or ship out.

Best, Santa Claus”

One more thing, (and this is just a nice to have) but it would be really great if you provided a window of when you plan on arriving Christmas night. I know you won’t come unless I’m asleep but life is unpredictable and I don’t wanna miss out just because I stayed up too late watching Home Alone and eating a sicko amount of figgy pudding. My cable company at least provides me with a window of when they plan on arriving (which they NEVER miss).

I know you’re immortal and all, but a little bit of modernizing could do you a lot of good. Remember Santa, give holiday cheer with the end user in mind.

Thanks for taking the time to read this Santa, I really appreciate it.

Sincerely,

Nick, age 27

Cornell scientists develop “killer cells” to destroy cancer in lymph nodes,"Cornell biomedical engineers have developed specialized white blood cells — dubbed “super natural killer cells” — that seek out cancer cells in lymph nodes with only one purpose: destroy them. This breakthrough halts the onset of metastasis, according to a new Cornell study published Nov. 2 in the journal Biomaterials.

“We want to see lymph node metastasis become a thing of the past,” said Michael R. King, the Daljit S. and Elaine Sarkaria Professor of Biomedical Engineering and senior author of the paper, “Super Natural Killer Cells That Target Metastases in the Tumor Draining Lymph Nodes.” King worked on the study with lead author Siddarth Chandrasekaran, Ph.D. ’15; Maxine F. Chan ’16; and Jiahe Li, Ph.D. ’15, biomedical engineering.

For tumor cells, the lymph nodes are a staging area and play a key role in advancing metastasis throughout the body. In the study, the biomedical engineers killed the cancerous tumor cells within days, by injecting liposomes armed with TRAIL (Tumor necrosis factor Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand) that attach to “natural killer” cells (a type of white blood cell) residing in the lymph nodes.

These natural killer cells became the “super natural killer cells” that find the cancerous cells and induce apoptosis, where the cancer cells self-destruct and disintegrate, preventing the lymphatic spread of cancer any further, said King.

“In our research, we use nanoparticles — the liposomes we have created with TRAIL protein — and attach them to natural killer cells, to create what we call ‘super natural killer cells’ and then these completely eliminate lymph node metastases in mice,” said King.

In cancer progression, there are four stages. At stage I, the tumor is small and has yet to progress to the lymph nodes. In stages II and III, the tumors have grown and likely will have spread to the lymph nodes. At the stage IV, the cancer has advanced from the lymph nodes to organs and other parts of the body.

Between 29 and 37 percent of patients with breast, colorectal and lung cancers are diagnosed with metastases in their tumor-draining lymph nodes — those lymph nodes that lie downstream from the tumor, and those patients are at a higher risk for distant-organ metastases and later-stage cancer diagnoses.

In January 2014, King and his colleagues published research that demonstrated by attaching the TRAIL protein to white blood cells, metastasizing cancer cells in the bloodstream were annihilated.

“So, now we have technology to eliminate bloodstream metastasis — our previous work — and also lymph node metastases,” King said.

This study was funded by the nonprofit organization Lynda’s Kause Inc., started by Lynda King, who died from cancer in July 2014. Lynda King is no relation to Michael King. The foundation funds metastatic cancer research and patient support, and Michael King’s laboratory received the organization’s first two research awards.",https://medium.com/cornell-university/cornell-scientists-develop-killer-cells-to-destroy-cancer-in-lymph-nodes-1e2684a4473a,['Cornell University'],2015-11-13 00:18:22.625000+00:00,"['Cancer', 'Research', 'Health']"
5 ways to make a unstoppable business,"a lot of people ask me at the conferences, what makes a unstoppable business? how do i keep businessing late into the night when my gums hurt and i’ve had enough business for the day??

as a leading thought leader, i have 5 secrets about business that will blow the lid off the whole damn thing

1. people

first off, what is a business? it’s people. think about it. it’s you and me, rubbing our hands together over data-sheets, igniting the sparks of a global econo-fire. that’s the blod and guts of the system okay?

that’s why diversity is so important, and why i constantly surround myself with all different kinds of men, tall men, fat men, men w/ confusing hats, etc. you want as many men in the boardroom as possible, so not a single man excluded

2. just graph it!

one mistake i notice many young founders make, is that they don’t measure things. this is why they always fail. measure everything. all aspects of my life are measured. even how much i’m measuring things. i know exactly how many things i have, and how many things i don’t have, at all times, forever. do you?

3. ideas, but more of them

you cant have a business without an idea. that’s why ideas are so rare, right?

WRONG. trick question. ideas are all around us. right now, you are inhaling 1,000,000s of potential ideas. ideas are just “electric words” and you need to monetize all of them, starting yesterday

4. take a breather somtimes, alright?

phew!

5. forget the handshake

handshakes are relics of the past (more on___t_this in a future post_s). so stop shaking hands already! you’re wasting time wagging another person’s fleshmeat when you could be businessing!

instead of shaking hands, look new clients directly in the eye and whisper, “i am now inside you”

5.5 push the limits to the max (…and beyond)

boundaries are artificial barriers that keep you from excelling. an empire can’t expand beyond the castle walls its build for its elf. that’s why i always “push the limits” to the MAX. example: you thought there were only going to be 5 secrets on this list, but count how many now.

you can’t get ahead unless you’re willing to go further, leave the limits behind in the star dust of the stratosphere ,,,,, b/c you deserve it

NEVER STOP >>

A sudden sense of liberty,"The title doesn’t even appear in the song, of course.

Same with Blue Monday, Thieves Like Us, Bizarre Love Triangle, Fine Time. Titles of New Order hits rarely appeared in their lyrics. But then they rarely appeared on their record sleeves, either. New Order seemed determined to keep you at arm’s length.

True Faith drew me in. I was around 12 or 13 and most singles I taped off the radio had hooks. Most videos did what videos were supposed to do — make pop stars look like pop stars. This was different.

The song was weird, in a really exciting way that I didn’t really understand or know what to do with. For the first time weird felt OK — warm, intoxicating, mysterious. The video was silly-memorable yet also mysterious. It made New Order seem the least pop-like pop stars I’d ever seen.

Things stick at that age, and True Faith got to me. It is euphoric, but also wistful and melancholic. It shape shifts its mood, resists definition. That ambiguity set me free, I think. I found it at the perfect time.

When I was a very small boy,

very small boys talked to me.

Now that we’ve grown up together,

they’re afraid of what they see.

I wasn’t quite a very small boy then. But I hadn’t grown up yet either. I was in limbo, able to look back but uncertain about the future. This verse, with its malevolent nursery rhyme rhythm, subjected me to an involuntary premonition. It was a weird, outside-yourself kind of feeling. But then, True Faith is a weird, outside-yourself kind of song. It was a madeleine into the future. It’s now a portal back to that feeling, that limbo. A limbo between innocence and experience, between the past and the future, between freedom and the price we pay for it.

I feel so extraordinary

Something’s got a hold on me

I get this feeling I’m in motion,

A sudden sense of liberty

The words of someone transported. An epiphany of the faithful, perhaps. Is this a song about religion? Perhaps back then I was dimly aware it might be. Its title isn’t sung, its dread of the future never labelled, yet that image of fearful men is coloured by each. Small boys grown up together, but pulled apart. Perhaps even then I figured that would require a force with the capacity to shape minds and erode trust.

But maybe I’m conflating my own sudden sense of liberty — my initiation into pop music — with the idea of religious epiphany. Certainly back then the song itself felt like a divine occurrence. Music wasn’t simply a click away. Songs you liked appeared on the radio and TV, suddenly, without warning. It was a blessed experience, and you simply prayed you’d be ready with the blank tape on pause.

I don’t care ’cause I’m not there,

And I don’t care if I’m here tomorrow

So maybe it’s not about religion, after all. Perhaps it’s about drugs. Or music. Or music and drugs. It would figure — Manchester, late 80s. But this is hedonism, not oblivion. Limbo — a glimpse from outside yourself, a realisation that only now and this really matter.

Looking at it now the song seems less about a particular object of devotion, and more about devotion itself — the dreamlike state of True Faith, testimony from someone momentarily stood outside of themselves. Blinkers off, for better or worse.

That’s the price that we all pay,

our valued destiny comes to nothing.

I can’t tell you where we’re going,

I guess there’s just no way of knowing.

Despite the sense of abandon, growing up comes at a terrible cost in True Faith. References to adult relationships are dotted around the three verses. They bring fear, guilt, disappointment and failure.",https://medium.com/a-longing-look/a-sudden-sense-of-liberty-306b83fba4da,['James Caig'],2015-11-03 09:30:28.519000+00:00,"['Lyrics', 'New Order', 'Music']"
5 Data Storytelling Homework Assignments,"Level Up Your Data Storytelling Game

What draws me to data storytelling? The opportunity to work in the space where analysis and intuition, qualitative and qualitative, logic and emotion, overlap. In my version, data and storytelling work in concert with each other. Both modes of thinking can be incorporated into every step of the process, from determining which questions to ask, to figuring out what data and methods can answer those questions, to designing and communicating the insights.

A couple of weeks ago, I had the opportunity to spend a day in Athens, Georgia with folks — designers, journalists, technologists, teachers, researchers — who share a love of data storytelling at Tapestry, a conference hosted by visualization software company Tableau. Here are some five homework assignments my favorite speakers inspired me to give myself, along with a few insights:

Homework Assignment #1: Create a data graphic on your cell phone

Hannah Fairfield, designer at the New York Times, spoke about how to create data graphics that build to a reveal — just like any other good story does. This concept was echoed throughout the day: When you show your audience “2 + 2” and trust them to infer “4,” they experience the information as discovery, which is stickier than simply presenting an interesting finding. As part of this talk, Fairfield shared an example of on motorcycle helmets and fatalities presented as a slideshow that steps the audience through a data story toward an insight. The slideshow was designed to be viewed on a cell phone (as is every graphic Fairfield develops for the Times):

This data story from the New York Times is, effectively, sequential data art. It’s designed with a mobile-first mindset.

While this graphic was designed for a cell phone, it wasn’t designed on a cell phone. Why should you even try such a thing? Designers often don’t “think in mobile” because they do their work on giant screens. Forcing yourself to not only view the graphics you make on a small screen, but build it there as well, will help reinforce the mobile-first mindset.

If, like me, you are at a loss in terms of how to actually create and edit graphics on your phone, here are some apps to get you started: iOS, Android.

Homework Assignment #2: Use a single set of data to tell 7 (or more) types of data stories

Ben Jones of Tableau Public — inspired by Kurt Vonnegut and Edward Segel and Jeffrey Heer’s must-read paper on visual narratives — presented seven common data story patterns: change over time, drill down, zoom out, contrast, intersections, factors, and outliers.

To illustrate these story types, Jones used a single data set on the freedom of the press. This approach highlights something I truly believe is at the heart of data storytelling (or any kind of storytelling, really): A single data set can lead to infinite stories. This is far more exciting than simply telling the story through different channels or mediums: The insight Jones pulled from the data, as well as the presentation, was different in each example he presented.

There are no doubt more than seven types of data stories, but this is a great start. Images are from Ben Jones’ presentation, (which I then converted to an animated gif).

It’s easy to become accustomed to telling certain types of stories with data. Those habits help us do our work better, especially when operating on a deadline. But sometimes we need to break them. Creativity is a never-ending dance of finding, learning, and outgrowing patterns, and this homework assignment can help you navigate that process.

Homework Assignment #3: Collaborate with a researcher and offer to visualize, for a new audience, the data they’ve compiled

Working with a small team, when Popular Science’s Kathryn Peek wants to do an ambitious storytelling project, she looks outside her organization for opportunities to collaborate. Often, this means teaming up with scientists and researchers to present their data in new ways for new audiences. As they work to present the information in new ways, they often end up uncovering new insights as well, as they did with this visualization of the lifecycle of scientific ideas.

Data storytelling happens in all kinds of settings — journalism, science, business, academia, education — and each of those communities has developed its own best practices, conventions and points of view. Cross-pollinating your data storytelling with another discipline provide news inspiration and has the potential to expand your skills as a data storyteller.

Homework Assignment #4: Write down your definitions of “data,” “story,” and “data story”

Data designer Kim Rees of Periscopic introduced herself with a statement she knew would be provocative at a data storytelling conference: She doesn’t think data and story belong together.

As she spoke, it became clear that her definition and my definition of “story” didn’t line up. She equates story with fiction, whereas I see story as a way of organizing information. (Many of my favorite storytellers — Joan Didion, John McPhee, Ira Glass, Jad Abumrad — deal in nonfiction.)

The reason I bring this up is not to debate Rees — although that would be fun — but to encourage as a thoughtful approach to the work of data storytelling. Definitions needn’t be concrete — in fact, I’m sure mine will be mutable — but forcing ourselves to think about them is a great way to examine the principles and assumptions that underlie the work we do as data storytellers.

Homework Assignment #5: Tell a data story using a QUESTION → ANSWER → NEW QUESTION structure

Storytelling is an an evolutionary strategy, says Newman University English professor Michael Austin. We tell stories because they help us survive; the entertainment value is a by-product. (Austin has written an entire book on the topic, Useful Fictions.)

The best stories create, then mediate, anxiety. How? By posing questions, then answering them. If you can do this in a way where the answer of one question gives rise to a new question, well then you’ve got yourself an infinite storytelling loop.

For a great story, pose a question that demands to be answered. For a never ending story, keep doing this.

How can this help you be a better data storyteller? You know why your data is important, but your audience doesn’t. Before you present the data, present a question that can be answered by the data. Create a need and then satisfy it.

What comes next?

As I complete these homework assignments, I’ll post the results and share them here — and I encourage you to do the same.

What data storytelling homework assignments have you given yourself, and how have they helped you be a better storyteller?

Texas Commissioner’s Facebook Post Suggests “Muslim World” Be Nuked,"By: editors

The elected Republican official recently shared a Facebook photo of a mushroom cloud, suggesting an atomic bomb to be used on Muslim countries for “peace.”

Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, whose Facebook page is usually filled with farm jokes and extremely patriotic quotes, has recently come under fire for a social media post that proposes bombing the “Muslim world” in the name of peace.

The photo, which Miller reposted from another Facebook page Patriots IV Drip 2 — an anti-Obama group known for their Islamophobic rhetoric — looked like it was taken from Nevada nuclear tests in 1957. Accompanied with some hateful hashtags, the photo read: “Japan has been at peace with the U.S. since August 9, 1945. It’s time we made peace with the Muslim world.”

Although the Republican’s campaign Facebook page soon removed the photo, the damage had already been done.

The hateful meme, suggesting the deadly weapon that killed tens of thousands of innocent people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki be used in middle-eastern countries, sparked an outrage among Texas Democrats.

“It is unacceptable for Republican Sid Miller to be promoting such disgusting rhetoric. Sadly, this kind of racist, xenophobic hate speech qualifies you for higher office with Republicans’ Tea Party fringe base,” stated Manny Garcia, Texas Democratic party deputy executive director. “We hope Sid Miller shows some respect for Texans and the responsibility of holding state office and issues an apology.”

However, Miller’s campaign spokesperson alleges that the commissioner did not share the photo himself as he is currently in China. To make the matters worse, he also made it perfectly clear that Miller will not apologize.

“We’re not going to apologize for the posts that show up on our Facebook page,” said Todd Smith, the Republican’s campaign spokesman. “I don’t know who did it, but I’m not going to start a witch hunt to find out who did.”

He estimated that about 18 people have access to the campaign account.

“I read the post this morning, and we’re at the 60th (sic) anniversary of dropping the atom bomb in order to destroy an insidious enemy that was intent on destroying American lives, and we face a similar enemy who has vowed to destroy American lives, and I think that’s the topic that the American people are focused on,” Smith added.

Whether Miller himself posted the image or someone else did, one thing is for certain. While posting such an outrageous thing on social media is a questionable sentiment for anyone, it’s a particularly bad idea for an elected government official.

Sid Miller served in the Texas House of Representatives for 12 years prior to his election as the state’s agriculture commissioner, and this is not the first time he has made headlines for his anti-Muslim remarks.

Earlier this year, the commissioner told a crowd in Austin that he worries his grandchildren would one day live in an America that was a “Muslim country.”

3 Million Judgments of Books by their Covers,"Last week, my friend Nate Gagnon and I launched Judgey, a browser-based game that gave users the opportunity to literally judge books by their covers. We’re both makers, and Nate is a writer, and I’m technical. So excuse me if I get technical — I promise to reward you with pretty graphs.

As it so happened, the internet approved of our goof, as did Goodreads (whose API we used), various public libraries and book stores, Book Riot, Adweek, and a few articles (some yet to surface). We also got a tenuous mention in The Washington Post (points if you can find it, but we’ll take it).

Having both seen what kind of traffic a reddit front page could bring (Nate for Forgotify and myself for Netflix’s “Spoil Yourself”) we did the needful technical bolstering to prevent a Reddit Hug of Death. I’d love to tell you about said bolstering, as well as technical aspects of the game’s development, but I’ll save that for a future post.

Spoiler: it will contain this graphic of some scores resulting from gameplay emulation for testing.

We tracked various datapoints of our first-week 300,000+ visitors using Google Analytics to monitor how many levels they completed and how judgmental they were. We waited to turn on more detailed event tracking until after the reddit spike, because Too Many Event Actions can get your tracking turned off entirely.

BUT THE POINT is that thanks to all you nice people, we saw 3 million books judged by their covers this last week, and we’ve crunched the numbers for the most recent 733,802 of these judgments.

One last preface: This isn’t a scientific study. The results do not account for how well known a book is (which would influence the rating despite the cover), nor do they account for the fact that Goodreads does not allow ratings under 1 star. Each book’s results certainly had a pattern however, some we found very interesting.

A Call to the West,"A Call to the West

How an 800-Year-Old Islamic Gospel Music Made Its Way to the States.

Brook Martinez has never been to Pakistan or India. He doesn’t speak a word of Urdu or Farsi. And he’ll quickly admit that he’s no scholar of Islam. Yet, Martinez has a unique bond with South Asians that most people from suburban Connecticut don’t share.

“Was I 100 percent comfortable taking a sacred music and playing it a non sacred context with no one who is even close to Sufi?,” said Martinez, recalling his initial doubts. “No.”

Brook Martinez (far right) playing at Barbes in Brooklyn, N.Y. in 2012.

Martinez is the leader of an 11-piece jazz band that covers the region’s popular genre of music called qawwali, or Islamic gospel. The spiritual tunes have been around for a while, almost 800 years, but it’s only in the last few decades that the the music has gained traction in the West.

“It was used as a way to attract people to Islam and started spreading from the very beginning with the Chistiya Sufis of Afghanistan and throughout Central Asia,” said Hiromi Lorraine Sakata, Professor Emeritus of Ethnomusicology at UCLA.“And that’s carried into this century because of technology like the radio, television and more recently with the Internet.”

“It’s no longer exclusive.”

Qawwali, which is rooted from the Arabic word for “call,” remains a stronghold in South Asia, largely because of its ties to classical Hindustani music. The performances typically range from 15 to 30 minutes and start off very slow, building up to a trance-like chorus and rhythm well suited for meditation or prayer.

The Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan Party performing at the University of Washington in 1993.

Today’s qawwali parties are made up of 6 to 10 members that include a lead singer; an accompanying singer, backup vocalists, a harmonium player and a tabla player. The music’s call-and-response rhythm, improvisations and thunderous choruses make it easy to get hooked.

However, it’s taken some time for the sacred songs to spread, largely because of the religious nature. The Sufi devotional music stems from the idea that one must pay remembrance to God, what’s referred to as zhikr, specifically samaa, an auditory form of prayer.

“The idea is the singing of one person or group actually leads to the religious experience or ecstasy of those who listen,” said Shazad Bashir, a religious studies professor at Stanford University. It’s why most qawwalis are about God, the Prophet Muhammad, the Prophet’s cousin Ali and the folklore of various Sufi saints.

Traditionally, one would have to go into the depths of Pakistan and India to listen to a qawwali performance. “This kind of music was only accessible to people who made pilgrimages to Sufi tombs or shrines,” said Sakata, who spent time in Pakistan observing qawwali. “They would walk to these places to show their devotion to their Sufi saints.”

But that changed as qawwalis slowly started to play outside the shrine and on the radio all the while becoming intertwined with India’s Bollywood scene. Eventually, the Sabri Brothers, a popular qawwali troupe that still performs today, brought the music for the first time to Carnegie Hall in 1975.

“The audience was clapping and shouting deliriously, and one man went so beyond himself that he bloodied his head—banging it into the side of the stage,” wrote John Rockwell, a New York Times reporter who attended the concert.

“It was really a reaffirmation of the power of music, and an extreme extension of the very sort of ecstasy that Western music-lovers experience with their own music.”

It took a few more decades until the genre’s most famous singer made his way to the states. “It’s when people like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan started getting very serious in the West that qawwali reached a much greater celebratory status in places like Pakistan,” said Bashir, who specializes in Persianate Islamic societies.

Khan, who passed away in 1997 and would’ve turned 65 this Sunday, was an international superstar and is widely considered the most important singer in qawwali history. He was awarded the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s International Prize in 1995 and posthumously made it to TIME’s 60 Years of Asian History issue and NPR’s 50 Great Voices list.

It was Khan’s willingness to collaborate with western artists like Peter Gabriel, Eddie Vedder and Michael Brook that distinguishes him from other qawwals. And though he was often criticized by traditionalists, his ability to fuse the music’s old-school elements with new genres helped spread the religious theater to broader audiences.

“He was always conscious of trying to interest people in Islam through his music and was anxious in trying to attract young listeners,” said Sakata, who followed Khan in Pakistan and subsequently invited him as a visiting professor when she taught at the University of Washington.

It’s because of Khan and the exposure he brought to the genre that bands like Fanna-Fi-Allah, a northern Californian all-Caucasian qawwali band, exist.

Tahir Faridi (second from left) performing with his band in Santa Rosa in 2012.

“I’d say being white has been something that’s made it easier for us on a lot of levels because it’s been surprising and more interesting for people,” said Tahir Faridi, the leader of the band. “But capturing the hearts of Indians and Pakistanis has been the most challenging part because they think ‘Oh, they’re white and can’t probably sing and are just pretending.’ They end up being very impressed by our devotion, passion and study.”

Over the past decade, Faridi and his group have traveled extensively through Pakistan not only to learn the ancient art, but also to continue it. The group’s members have been invited into the living rooms of the genre’s biggest teachers, known culturally as Ustads, where they’ve spent countless hours in lesson and practice. That training ultimately paved the way for the group to play across the region’s sacred Sufi shrines and can be heard in their performances in the West.

“Our aspiration in performing qawwali is to play it as well as we can in hopes of paying respects to our teachers and what they’ve offered,” says Faridi. “Over the years, hopefully the band will be a source of religious and spiritual upliftment in the West that continues to give back to the tradition.”

While it’s rare to find a group like Fanna-Fi-Allah that has gone to Pakistan and back, there have been other instances of the sufi devotional music sprouting across the states. A group of South Asian Americans in Austin, Texas recently formed the Riyaaz Qawwali Party and perform traditional songs across the country.

And abroad, the fusion that Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan started still continues—qawwali elements can be heard mixed with the likes of flamenco to dub step.

“It’s kind of a natural process where one hears something new, is excited about it and starts to use it and claim it as his own,” Sakata said. “This is the way traditions continue. It has to be vital. If no one is interested, or nobody uses it or listens to it or composes in that style, then it’s not going to continue.”",https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/a-call-to-the-west-5f554a8c5be7,[],2015-08-28 20:13:04.579000+00:00,"['Islam', 'Music', 'American Dream']"
The X-factor That Every Professional Needs,"In the new X men movie, Professor Xavier’s ability to read minds, and control people, is acknowledged as the most special ability.

This is not because his abilities are awesome or cool, which they are, but because those abilities allows the Professor to absorb other peoples pain, without suffering under it.

It allows the Professor to bear under peoples deepest pains, and still be full of hope.

The Professor uses this ability to understand people and come up with solutions to help them with their pain.

What the Professor has, and is identified as telepathy, is simply empathy.

I define empathy as the ability to read people, to feel what others feel, and understand their emotions.

This is one of the most important skills in business. Business is about problem solving, and people will always pay more for problems that have emotional weight, and intensity, attached to them.

The most dangerous pains in life are never the physical ones, no matter how excruciating, but internal, emotional and spiritual.

Markets are made up of people, and the desires of human beings change as time goes on.

The most powerful ability an entrepreneur can have is the ability to understand people, human nature, needs and wants, and provide solutions.

Professor Xaviers excellence is rooted in the fact that he can understand truths and insights about people, better than they know their own selves.

This is what Henry Ford did when he decided to give people the commercial automobile instead of faster horses, which they would of probably asked for.

He anticipated and understood the changing wants and needs of the market.

Michael Dell did the same thing when he dared to believe that people would actually buy high end products, such as computers, online without being in a store to touch and feel it.

Steve Jobs did this multiple times, when he decided to make an mp3 with the most basic functions, including just one button.

In order to be a better entrepreneur, or an extraordinary professional, you must be able to:

1) Empaphise with people. Know how to read people, and see things from they eyes of those you want to serve. Learn to know them better than they even know or notice about themselves.

2) You have to be somebody that is proactive and solutions orientated, do not just understand people, but look for solutions.

Some people just acknowledge problems, that is only half of the journey.

3) Anticipate change, this is the only way you can best prepare yourself to deal with pain, failure, challenges, and pressure.

Professor Xavier has to first anticipate and embrace pain in order to bear under the pressure of it.

When you anticipate change, you are in a much better position to stay composed under pressure.

Do not be caught off guard, hope for the best, and prepare for the worse.

It’s Time For Me To Tackle Something New,"Cue the sappy music. About six years ago, I pitched my idea for Tested to the folks at Whiskey Media. My pitch was simple, let’s make a technology site that’s about having fun with technology instead of showing people how snarky and cool we could be.

I never could have predicted the way that one conversation would change my life. Since Norm and I launched Tested in 2010, I’ve been privileged to go places and see things that I never thought I’d see in person. I stood on top of a nuclear reactor (while it was running!), I was the kitchen assistant to a couple of world-class chefs who were developing recipes for astronauts, I helped test different ways to waterproof cameras, I hosted a bunch of 24-hour charity shows, I tested talk time on six phones simultaneously, I 3D printed LOTS of goofy stuff, I learned to race quadcopters, I made a bunch of goofy faces, I saw the future of robotics, I helped turn a San Diego bar into the carbon freezing chamber from Empire Strikes Back, and I had the opportunity to work with and learn directly from Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman on a daily basis.

Put another way, I’ve spent the last five and a half years meeting thousands of amazing people and helping to tell their stories every day. The places I’ve been and things I’ve seen are nothing compared to the amazing makers, scientists, nerds, students, and entrepreneurs I’ve gotten to meet while making the 2512 videos (as of 9/10/2015) that we’ve posted on Tested since 2010.

But, now it’s time for me to step away from Tested and take on a new challenge.

One of the things I’ve realized about myself over the last five years is that I’m happiest when I’m testing the tech on the bleeding edge — the technology so new that the creator’s original intent is still visible and the long-term potential is murky. The decisions made in these early moments of a new technology are the ones that change the world. By the time designers are worrying about incremental updates and chamfered edges, I’m bored.

Enter VR. I may have accidentally become the face of VR thanks to a couple of excellent photographs that Norm shot (Thanks Norm!) , but I find VR captivating nonetheless. From my perspective, VR is the next rough-edged technology with the potential to change the world.

After sharing a virtual world with another person during the Oculus Touch demo at E3 this year, I became a believer. I can’t stop thinking about the potential of VR as a communication medium. To that end, I’m starting a company to test out some different ways to communicate in VR. I’ve put together what I think is a pretty solid plan, but need to start doing all the scary business stuff I’ve never done before — raising money from investors, building a development team, hiring a lawyer, figuring out how to do payroll, and a bunch of other stuff I’ve probably never considered. As I ramp up my new company over the next few months, I’ll be gradually stepping back from my day-to-day duties on Tested.

Don’t worry, I’m leaving Tested in good hands. Norm and I have always run Tested as a team. Both of our business cards have always said “Editor”. We’ve always done what we wanted on small stuff and consulted each other on big projects. The results show on the site. I have the greatest confidence that Norm will continue making Tested the most interesting site on the Internet.

And I’m not going to disappear from Tested. I’ll continue on Still Untitled as a regular, a guest on This Is Only a Test, and probably even pop up in videos from time to time. And Norm, I’m available as a guest for LEGO With Friends! And yes, I’ll be at the live show in San Francisco next month.

So what’s next for me? I won’t be ready to give the full details for a while, but you can sign up for my TinyLetter to get 100% spam-free email updates about how things are going, follow me on Twitter for company updates (and other nonsense), sub to my YouTube channel, or subscribe to posts here.

Thank you all for your support over the years. I also owe a debt of gratitude to the everyone from Whiskey Media (including our former partners-in-crime at Giant Bomb, ComicVine, Screened, and AnimeVice) and Whalerock Industries who have made it possible for me to do everything that we’ve done at Tested so far.

More than anyone else, Norman Chan has been an amazing creative partner over the last 8 years, both at Tested and Maximum PC. Thanks Norm.

Edit: Like the biggest asshole ever, I didn’t post the right version. Joey Fameli has been behind the camera on the vast majority of videos we’ve posted over the last five years. He is the reason we look good in our videos. He shot the very first videos we put on the site, dealt with my amateur behavior while we were learning how to do video, and gently nudges us in the right direction. Thanks Joey.

Creating a Planetary Nervous System,"Dear Friends,

In 1998, former U.S. vice president Al Gore introduced a concept called Digital Earth, a virtual planet that is georeferenced, connected to the world’s digital knowledge. In the past 15 years, we have witnessed a quiet revolution in the deployment of sensor networks acquiring atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial data.

Sadly, this public data is hard to find, access and use.

In 2012, I founded marinexplore.org. Starting with a handful of Estonians, we built a search engine for public ocean data and a community for ocean professionals. We got data from 35 organizations and 40,000 instruments worldwide, with 8,000 excited community members asking for more. We learned that unless we expanded beyond oceans, our unique approach would not make a difference in the world. That’s why Planet OS was born.

Planet OS is a new revolutionary search engine designed for the next generation of Digital Earth delivering access to public data without moving it. Combined with Planet OS Toolkit, software developers can work with domain experts and create bespoke applications that solve some of their most pressing problems.

How much data is out there? Nobody knows for sure, but we know that our new system has indexed more data in 3 months than we had in the past 3 years. We hope that in not so distant future we will deliver it to your fingertips.

What would you solve with better Earth data?

Imagine all planet Earth Data interconnected available to the creativity of the best minds of our time, from researchers to software developers, but also the curious child who is just starting to explore the world?

Planet OS can provide solutions in affordable & clean energy, combating climate change, and protecting marine ecosystems. For example, Planet OS is being used to develop:

a real-time dashboard for increasing power output of sustainable wind energy. This happens by combining public weather data with turbine data in one system; replace spreadsheets with real-time environmental monitoring for the offshore and maritime industry; and use sound field analysis to help to reduce man-made noise in the oceans.

Al Gore said we need a Digital Earth. I think what we really need is a Planetary Nervous System. Help us to build a resilient, interconnected network which allows us to truly understand our Planet, and take action for a sustainable future right now.

Thank you!",https://medium.com/planet-os/creating-a-planetary-nervous-system-29ef67e9c90e,['Planet Os'],2015-09-28 21:42:03.008000+00:00,"['Climate Change', 'Sustainability', 'Open Data']"
Working For The Man Is Taxing,"Layoffs can be hard but they’re often my favorite part, more so if a triumph follows. I honestly can’t remember leaving a job where I’d wanted to stay longer. Maybe I’m lucky but jitters aside, I’ve always been happy to leave. Jobs are a mostly source of constant frustration, fewer than half of Americans would say they are satisfied with their work. We’re either unhappy, disengaged, over skilled or just underemployed.

Working towards retirement seems like an imagined passageway — lasting maybe a few years or a lifetime, towards a vacation — permanent or not. Sounds like Catholic sentiment, work hard now and be find rewards in another life. The middle of three boys, I’ve probably produced and reproduced the least. But I do travel a lot and keep a few passion projects. Personally, I never saw the point in staying on a career course if you didn’t like the trajectory or didn’t respect your boss.

Though I wasn’t always a designer. Life is good now but sometimes I wonder if I’ve really advanced all that much since high school. Charging $65/hr in the late 90s to build websites gave me a distorted sense of money. Nearly every job since then has paid less per hour, often far less. Not that my teenage rates weren’t worth it. My first client, a pharmaceutical company only just took their decade old site offline and replaced it with a barebones landing page.

Maybe I wasn’t ready to work in technology or just didn’t have the design credentials that I ended up as a debt collection agent around my mid 20s. My Mom worked on the same team, and for Marlene, the immigrant dream meant being a well qualified lecturer from India but disqualified from teaching in Canada. So she ended up working in a large national banking center where the street names reflected the trade. Some twenty or so floors of Immigrants which gradually shifted to “old stock” Canadians the higher up you went in the building, until at last you reached the top floor.

But the ceiling for Brown women must not be very high in Canadian corporate culture, seen in the wage gap between them and White native borns. They’re often over-skilled but discounted. Some say that things have slowly been improving, since we’ve normalized the visible minority discount somewhere between a 10–20% wage gap. As an Indian American living in the Bay Area, I have a mere 9% marginalized tax rate, a kind of systemic tax levied on women, visible minorities and women minorities. That’s in addition to the 9.3% marginal tax rate of California. 21st century equality…

Either way, I’ve never cared much for working in a call center, living in the ‘burbs or being discounted. On my 25th birthday, I gave the bank a weeks notice and followed my girlfriend to Michigan. “Y’all can all go fuck yourself!” That’s kinda what I imagined a future in America as.

So I just left. I quit Canada cold. I learned to stop saying sorry all the time. And about a year after I left, that succubus Stephen Harper became Prime Minister and he’s been there since.

My Canadian socialism gradually turned Californian libertarian — part mystic, part hedonist — but I knew early on, looking at upper management in Canada, that I was better off in new company.

Burning Down the Mouse,"No matter how your heart is grieving over the absurd cost, you must take your kids to Disneyland. The theme park has become a compulsory routine of modern American parenting. But even after you navigate the labyrinthine parking structure and slog amid impossible crowds pushing double-wide strollers across miles of hot concrete, even after you stand in the last of a dozen endless lines, all the while fielding existential riddles from your kids like “Why are we still standing here?” and “What are we doing?,” even after you endure a series of lackluster rides that amount to interactive advertisements for undead franchises, no sense of calm and well-being descends. You don’t feel proud of yourself for delivering the dream of Disney to your offspring. Instead, you feel like you’ve yanked your impressionable kids straight into the white-hot center of the tyrannically cheerful consumerist farce we call American culture. As George Clooney’s character tells a young optimist at the start of Disney’s Tomorrowland, “You’ve been manipulated into thinking you were part of something incredible. You thought you were special, but you’re not.”

Naturally, such skepticism is just a setup for that climactic moment when old-fashioned, Disney-style hope wins out. Nearly religious positivity in the face of doom lies at the heart of the Disney brand, after all — which may be why Banksy’s Dismaland, a theme-park homage to dystopian despair operating in the British seaside town of Weston-super-Mare until the end of September, incites such a powerful feeling of vertigo. The mysterious street artist couldn’t have better timing: Somehow a company built around a cartoon mouse has miraculously evolved and expanded and weathered countless storms of widespread skepticism, not to mention jacked-up ticket prices, overcrowding, and a measles outbreak last year that didn’t conjure fantasy or frontier or future so much as the perils of life in South Sudan. Along with the huge chunk of cultural mindshare in its pocket (ESPN, ABC, the Disney Channel, Star Wars, Pixar, Marvel), Disney has amassed thousands of sprawling acres of immaculate, branded property worldwide, from Disneyland Paris to Tokyo Disneyland to Hong Kong Disneyland, every foot of it haunted by the triumphant strains of “Once Upon a Dream” or “Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo” emitting from omnipresent speakers, every sight and sound and sensation a carefully honed feat of interactive advertising that continues to draw toddlers and teenagers and singles and couples and victorious athletes and dying children alike.

This is exactly the fairy tale that Dismaland aims to disrupt with its filthy, crumbling concrete spaces, its depressed park attendants clad in mouse ears, its orca emerging from a toilet, its boats full of immigrants circling ghost-faced through a polluted pond. Such images may be simple, but they’re meant to hit us at the same simple level that Disneyland itself does. While Cinderella’s corpse hanging from a toppled carriage as paparazzi cameras flash might strike some onlookers as overly obvious, it’s obvious by design. The catastrophes unfolding around us aren’t hard to miss, after all, but we continue to avert our eyes. As our public spaces worldwide are transformed into matching, carefully designed corporate realms dominated by shiny, flashing screens, the filth of Dismaland feels undeniably jarring. We don’t pay money to enter filthy spaces. This grit confuses us. This grit is the sad truth of modern times that we mostly manage to avoid.

Watch the trailer for Banksy’s Dismaland

Banksy couldn’t aim for a worthier target if he tried. Walt Disney wanted Disneyland to offer a comforting, clean, and harmonious escape from reality, to provide a nostalgic passage to small-town America in a time of anxiety. But Disneyland was also meant to embody the adventurous, can-do spirit of America, the America that still believed in its Gilded Age destiny as a city upon a hill, a shining example of liberty and prosperity for the rest of the world to emulate. That notion has long since expired, of course. As J. G. Ballard put it in 1983, the American dream “no longer supplies the world with its images, its dreams, its fantasies… It supplies the world with its nightmares now.”

In Disneyland, then, we recognize the outlines of modern thought, the ways we protect ourselves from harsh reality, the ways we’ve come to prefer these protections, this fakeness, to reality itself. Where once we decried mass-produced entertainment and the stultifying sameness of corporate-owned spaces, most of us are now humming anthems from Frozen and forsaking relatively lackluster public parks for the much more engrossing modern playground of the Apple Store. Even the quirkiest corners of the internet are crowded with full-color, interactive ads for the last corporate commodity we searched for on Amazon or mentioned in passing on Facebook, and now those random searches will result in phone calls from telemarketers who seem to know more about us than we know about ourselves. No matter how we try to wriggle into some virgin corner of the world free from screens or cameras or phones, unsullied by flashing ads or surveillance, devoid of jubilant ballads or beeping devices, we fail. We’re all plugged into a shiny, down-home, buoyant, authentic-seeming global simulacrum, one that not only doesn’t belong to us, but bleeds us of our sanity, our money, and our privacy and sells it off to the highest bidder. We are ravenous and impossible to satisfy. The illusory corporate grid of fantastical characters is real; we are the imaginary ones.

Can I Be The Almighty?,"“Religion is the prop of a man who has not yet found himself.”

This is an argument put forward by the Indian revolutionary Bhagat Singh. He denounced religion as the garb of a man who does not know himself. This is a radical statement and it gave me some food for thought. Having considered it for some time, I feel that this statement does hit on a significant point.

Only a man who has not realised his true potential, who has not realised how powerful he is, will search for a higher power to submit to. Man himself becomes the almighty should he come to realise his true power.

This sounds arrogant but what Bhagat Singh was alluding to was his belief that subscribing to a religion or God is a futile exercise. It gives you no power which you do not already have.

This makes sense to me; after all, what does one really gain by having a religion? At most, one gets a sense of belonging to a community — a group of people with a common set of values. This may be a priority to some and to those religion has some meaning. To others, religion serves no other purpose than to provide rules to stick by.

Defining Your Own R Operators,"Defining Your Own R Operators

for better readability and for its sheer awesomeness!

Say you are on your R console, writing some R code that will conquer the world! Let’s say you reached the point where you want to check the non-existence of the letter “a” in a list of characters [“a”, “b”, “c”]. So, you might think, negating the %in% operator like this:

!(""a"" %in% c(""a"", ""b"", ""c""))

… but conquering the world requires more readability! So how about we define our own negation operator? This is done like this:

'%notin%' <- Negate('%in%')

Using our freshly minted negation operator makes for much more readable code:

""a"" %notin% c(""a"", ""b"", ""c"")

The source of this tip is this tweet by LearnR.

Why stop at negation? We can extend this neat trick to build other operators as well. For example we can create a binary addition operator like this:

#define the add operator

'%add%' <- function(a,b) a+b #perform addition using our defined add operator

1 %add% 3 #output

The Dead and the Dying,"Death has been following me around lately.

It’s difficult to explain. But I’ve been feeling his presence a lot more these days. Lurking around. Waiting.

A friend of mine didn’t wake up a couple of weeks ago. Dead at 29. I’d just spent months sharing a desk with him. And death was just hanging around us, counting down mere days until he could show up.

And 48 hours ago, my bus dropped me off a couple of blocks away where death had greeted at least 769 people just a couple of hours before. I looked down and saw bodies on stretchers, and ambulances screamed past me. The stampede in Mina during the annual hajj pilgrimage is the worst tragedy to befall Saudi Arabia in over a quarter of a century.

Two days later, I’m sitting on a plane, as I’ve done too often this past month, waiting for my lukewarm tasteless airplane meal. Twenty-four hours from now, I’ll be ordering my artisanal coffee at the hipster coffee place near my studio and walking into the office overlooking the bay in San Francisco.

I was going to fly back to the U.S. from Saudi Arabia. But couldn’t do it. I flew back to Cairo for a four-hour transit just to see my sister and three brothers for a couple of hours before I had to get right back on a plane.

I haven’t really processed what happened.

All I know is I didn’t tear up when I saw the dead covered with sheets. I didn’t cry when a survivor recounted to me how he was heaped on top of piles of bodies. I didn’t feel much when I literally walked down the same path where people had breathed their last only hours before.

I only burst into tears when I hugged my family goodbye.

The thought I’m too afraid to articulate out loud keeps popping up in my head: It might be the last time I see any one of the people I love.

Death isn’t this far away thing like I thought as a child. It’s not just for old people. It’s not for the ill. It strikes anywhere, anytime. And the terrifying thought grips my mind: What if getting on this plane means I’ve seen my beautiful, wonderful, incredible grandmother for the last time? My funny little brother? And my heart squeezes and contracts to even type this and tears spring to my eyes — what if I never see my kind-hearted, loving, giving mother again?

I’m being melodramatic, I know. But I live half a world away from everyone I love. I picked up and left everything and everyone I know two years ago. If I knew my time was limited, if the life of someone I love was limited, would I stay here, so far away?

My mind and brain are confused. Twenty-four hours ago, I was sweltering in the blistering heat in a desert, praying over dead people. And 12 hours later, I walked into a mall with my siblings where people were celebrating Eid, a Muslim holiday, dressed in new clothes with laughing children everywhere.

The world has evolved where you can be in a war zone today and on a beach tomorrow. But our brains and hearts and eyes and ears haven’t caught up yet. A day ago, my eyes were seeing old men crying as they slept on the ground wrapped in nothing but towels. I was in the middle of a throng of thousands of people walking by a mountain chanting. And now I’m watching the boy on the airplane seat next to me watch Toy Story and I’m telling the flight attendant I would like a coke with lemon and no ice, please.

My life as a journalist has changed me. I remember this morgue in Egypt one time where I asked, “How many bodies?”, wrote the number down and then drove to the mall to have dinner with my friends.

And when watching fridges of bodies drive past me yesterday, when a man driving a truck full of body stretchers shouted at me to “move!” and when people sent me messages telling me they had relatives who died and might I know how they could identify them? I wasn’t feeling much. When I was told that if I had come earlier that day and walked around our camp site, meters away from the stampede area, to explore (as I was wont to do) I may have been caught in the stampede, I wasn’t struck by my own human mortality.

I was on autopilot. My brain was busy telling me to tweet, live stream, do phoners for news channels, upload vines, take photos, interview survivors — and “Oh, is he centered in the frame?” and what about the rule of thirds and “Oh, that ambulance siren was too loud the audio level will spike”, and “Oh, damn, my battery is running low and the 3G connection is too bad to send the footage to the producer”, and “Oh, when I’m walking up this bridge the wide shot will look good”, and “How about in this crowd, if I walk backwards and get a shot of them looking back”, and “Oh, maybe I should go read some Qur’an, I’m on a pilgrimage, and maybe have lunch with my mother. I’m not going to see her again for months and months and months.”

I wonder if my lack of spirituality on my hajj takes away from its meaning. I’d like to think not. I’d like to think that I did good by playing a little role in a job that is vital in this world today. I’d like to believe God put me in a position to do so and I would have been doing wrong if I didn’t do what I could do: report.

I’m looking out my flight window now. I see lights. How many lights have I seen this month? In five weeks, I have literally traveled the globe. From San Francisco to Washington DC, then onwards to Nashville, and then Hawaii. I transited through China to Malaysia, and then through Sri Lanka to Pakistan. I flew to Cairo for a day and then to Poland for a conference through Germany. I flew to Alexandria for a day and then onwards to Saudi Arabia for hajj.

Thousands and thousands of miles. Dozens of plane rides. So many humans. So many lives. So many experiences. So much we’re doing. So busy our brains. So fragmented our lives and so fluid and so busy.

We see too much. So much, it’s hard for something to leave an impact.

A week from now, no one will be talking about the poor pilgrims. Or the people who were sleeping on the ground in the 115 degree heat because they couldn’t afford a tent and were trampled while they were sleeping. We will have moved on to some new tragedy. Another boat sank in the Mediterranean, another horrific accident somewhere on the globe.

And in the midst of all this, our lives go on. We go to the mall, we order Chinese food, we watch Netflix. There’s only so much tragedy you can empathize with before it consumes you.

And the thread that links us all, present in every second: you are dying with every breathe you take. Everyone we love and care about is dying too. Could be tomorrow. Could be 50 years from now.

#WhatIWantedToWear: Auntiji,"Here’s the thing: being fabulous doesn’t protect you. Compliments don’t keep you safe. The thing about being a transfeminine person is that everyone always remarks on how “fierce” or “fabulous” you are, but few people ask how you are getting home. Every day I look at my closet I have to ask myself how I’m getting home. Every day I look at my closet I have to ask myself how I’m feeling that day. Am I ready to endure constant street harrassment? Am I ready to be gawked at? Am I ready to have people take photos of me without their consent? Am I coming home late?

I hate how our society evaluates peoples’ gender identities based off of what they look like. If I had it my way I would dress femme every single day. But I don’t, because I can’t. Often I’m too afraid. Often I’m too tired. When I look at people on the subway I try to think about all of the outfits that they would have worn, could have worn, how they could have fashioned their bodies if we lived in a world where being different is demonized.

Today I had a photo shoot in my house. What I love about being at home is that I can wear whatever the hell I want! I’m that girl who will call you over for tea and be wearing the most extravagant outfit. People will ask: “Where are you going?” I wonder: Why do we have to be leaving somewhere to be dressed up? Being at home makes me feel most safe.

When I left the house after the shoot I decided to wear the outfit on the right. I knew that people would probably read me as a gay man. But I knew that would probably get me home without being followed. Sometimes that feels like enough.

I’m tired of hijab.,"When I was 19, I stood on stage and talked about being propositioned by a university professor. I said he was a dirty old man and repeated some of the choice phrases women hear every day in the streets of Egypt.

When I left the theater later that evening, I overheard two men:

“Isn’t she ashamed of herself for saying such dirty words when she’s veiled?!”

Fast forward five years. I sat on a panel next to the president of Catalonia, speaking to more than 800 people from over 40 countries. And yet later on that day a man raised his hand after my presentation and said:

“You know, we’re doing you a favor.

We’re helping you take that symbol of oppression off your head.”

I’m tired of being the token “omg-look-such-an-articulate-awesome-non-stereotypical hijabi!”

I’m tired of hijab taking up so much space in my life.

I’m tired of speaking about it.

I’m tired of explaining it.

I’m tired of defending it.

I’m tired of being treated differently.

I’m tired of having to prove I’m normal.

I’m tired of being thought stupid and backwards.

I’m tired of the judgments — from both sides.

I’m tired of the opportunities denied.

I’m tired of expectations.

I’m tired of hijab.

It’s been a long, hard slog. I’ve been veiled for 15 years. I spent years writing about it, justifying it, hating it, loving it, ignoring it, defending it.

I did theater. Spoken word. I represented. I wrote angry critiques of the representation of Muslim women in media. I didn’t let other people speak for this Muslim woman. I spoke for myself.

I Wanted Someone To Love Me,"This article outlines experiences of Sister J and contains some graphic descriptions of upsetting events.

When I was 16, I got together with my first serious boyfriend. My parents were not sure about him at first because he was a couple of years older than me, and there were rumours that his brother sold drugs. However, they gave him the benefit of doubt and eventually my parents grew very fond of him. Unfortunately, he was far from what he originally seemed. I had very low self-esteem when we started dating. My low self-esteem started in my early teens. I always felt like the ugly duckling and the outsider among my friends. When I met him, he was very charming and kind of goofy but this was all a ruse.

It was not long into the relationship before he began psychologically and physically abusing me. He would always hit me in my back and the tops of my legs, all the places where nobody could see. He would even hit me with the metal legs of a tall stall. He would make me eat mouthfuls of dried chillies as punishment if I said something he did not like. My parents were right about his brother, he was a drug dealer. My boyfriend would make us hang out with his brother and friends all the time. I was manipulated into taking drugs I did not want to take. I began using “speed” and “trips” as a way of escaping the reality of the abuse I was receiving. As well as the abuse, my boyfriend was constantly cheating on me. He would make sure I stayed with his brother and friends if he went out so they could keep any eye on me. Sadly, one of the “friends” took advantage of my vulnerability and drug usage. He had sex with me which resulted in my now 22 year old son whom I love dearly.

When I found out I was pregnant, my self-esteem plummeted to new lows and my life felt like it spiralled even more out of control. When I tried to ask for help from my family, I was just accused of being an attention seeker. They did not believe me when I told them the things my boyfriend did. After my son’s birth, things got worse. When my son was about 2 years old, I took an overdose and had to have my stomach pumped. This is when a tube is forced down your throat and a charcoal liquid is poured into your stomach to force you to vomit. This was when I was first diagnosed with depression and was told I had probably been suffering with it for many years. This made a lot of sense to me. After my diagnosis, I got some strength and finally left my abusive boyfriend.

I was sent to counselling and put on antidepressants. My life seemed to be getting back together. I had a good set of friends around me. My self-esteem was rising but I still longed for one thing: I longed for someone to love me.

When my son was 6, I bumped into an old friend. This man was to become my husband (now ex-husband). In the beginning, he was charming, loving and considerate. However, his abuse towards me was more extreme than my first boyfriend. My ex-husband physically, sexually, financially and psychologically abused me over and over again. He timed everywhere I went, monitored all my phone calls, spent all my money and got me in debt. He slapped, punched, kicked, bit and hit me with objects. One day, he missed my knee by millimetres when he hit me with a hammer. He broke a broom handle over my head. He pulled me by my hair so much that I would cry in pain every time I washed my hair. He pinned me against the fridge and would only let go just before I passed out. He forced me to strip naked and sent me naked out in my back garden. He would smell my underwear for the smell of sex and accuse me of sleeping with other men. He raped me many times. There were times he beat me so bad I could hardly move and he would still force himself on me. He would force me to do unspeakable things that made me feel dirty and degraded. He not only abused me but isolated me from family and friends so I had no one to turn to for help. I called for help other ways. On one occasion, I tried to slit my wrist and on another, I took another overdose, again resulting in having my stomach pumped. When I finally escaped him I can honestly say I was shell of who I should have been. I did not recognise myself at all.

Since then I have received many different types of counselling, some which have helped and some that have not. The hardest thing about all of this is that my family still do not understand depression. They did not and still do not acknowledge that I suffered with it. To this day, I remain on antidepressants. When I felt so low and could not get out of bed, I was called lazy. There were days I would just cry constantly for no reason at all and was accused of seeking attention. I cannot really put into words what it felt to be so low that the only option was to try and take my own life.

Thankfully, I manage it better these day. I still have the occasional low days but have not felt as low or depressed as I did in both my abusive relationships. My self-esteem and self-worth have started coming back gradually over time. I attended support groups for abused women and started doing a lot of reading. Five years ago, I started researching Islam and through that research, I found many answers to questions I had over the years and started to find a sense of peace within myself. Four years ago, I took my shahada and my life has improved greatly beyond what I hoped for. I have met some wonderful amazing sisters who have been a tremendous support to me. I find so much peace and solace reading the Qur’an and during Salah. When I find myself feeling low I automatically make dua’a or pick up the Qur’an. I had reached a certain level in my life where my self-esteem and self-worth had returned but that has increased tenfold since becoming a Muslim. I feel truly blessed.

Today, I am a facilitator and run domestic violence support groups. I have also been blessed with the opportunities to have spoken at a variety of events to help bring more awareness of the realities of domestic violence. The abuse I received from two ex-partners and the subsequent depression I had because of it now pushes me to speak up about it in order to help others. My hope is that by speaking out others will feel they can, too, seek help. My hope is that that they will see that they are not alone; there are people that understand and that will listen without judgement. There are people out there that can help.",https://medium.com/inspirited-minds/i-wanted-someone-to-love-me-dd52c31f9233,['Inspirited Minds'],2015-12-28 13:02:12.287000+00:00,"['Relationships', 'Domestic Violence', 'Abuse']"
Bottom-Up Navigation,"Contextual Navigation & Minimal Headers

Visitors who arrive on your site via Google (or any social media site with a feed, e.g. all of them) are extremely likely to bounce. If the content they’ve found isn’t quite what they want, they’re gonna pogo stick back to their search results (or news feed) and try another one.

If you want a second chance to capture a pogo sticker, you’ve got one great tool at your disposal: they’ve already told you what they’re looking for. Something about that piece of content matched their search terms (or captured their interest) and you can reasonably assume that similar content might do the same.

So sweep out the breadcrumbs and take a tag-based approached to contextual navigation.

A website header without all the crap. Looks a lot like an app header. Weird.

The top of a content page has two jobs:

Help visitors evaluate the content as quickly and easily as possible. If it’s not what they want, help them find similar content.

Tag-based navigational links do both of those things. They provide keywords that tell visitors what the content is about, plus they can link up to browse pages that map to each of those keywords. That’s good for SEO and it’s two more things than a traditional navigation header ever did.

Nobody fires up a web browser because they want to experience some really awesome decision trees.

And speaking of useless, let’s talk more about breadcrumbs. They’re those little lists of tiny text links that tell you where you are on a site, or so the theory goes. Ask Hansel and Gretel how well that works.

Breadcrumb trails uselessly reproduce navigation options already available in the header, most commonly “Home” or, even worse, they reproduce the Back button. They force content to pretend it “lives” in one and only one place, when it should be linking up to any and all related browse pages.

So what should we do instead? I say dispense with the idea that users need to know “where” they are on your site.

IED Awareness for First Responders,"You are a first responder. You have received a call at a crowded local motel for a medical emergency. The manager unlocks the room and you enter to find a man unconscious on the floor. As you treat him, you notice something unusual. Around the room, you notice bottles of chemicals; acids, hydrogen peroxide, acetone, and other bottles of unknown liquids. You also notice a number of batteries on a table next to an electronic timer, dozens of nuts and bolts taped inside the lid of a briefcase, and half a dozen mason jars containing a clear liquid, and what appears to be white sediment. Then the kicker, you observe several small, silver, cylindrical objects with wires protruding from the ends labeled DANGER EXPLOSIVES on a nearby shelf. Your partner looks at you and says, “Well, well. What do we have here?”

That question has surely been asked many times by first responders who have stumbled upon bomb making operations in the course of their duties. Some might default to thinking they have walked into a meth lab due to the chemicals present. But the presence of certain items signals something perhaps more nefarious. In either case, I will say right now, if you should ever encounter something like this get out, secure the room, call the bomb squad and evacuate the premises. Read on, and you will discover why.

The intent of this article is to educate first responders on how to recognize the components of potential improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Without getting into too much detail, it provides a very basic understanding of IEDs.

In addition to the container, which can be anything from a shipping envelope to a backpack, briefcase or even a vehicle, there are four components to most IEDs. Remembering them is made easy by using the acronym PIES: Power, Initiator, Explosive and Switch. Power is self-explanatory. It provides the heat needed to initiate an explosion. Batteries are a good source of power as they allow the IED to be easily transported and remotely placed without tell-tale wires giving away its location.

It is important to understand that not all explosives are the same. Some, such as gun powder, are sensitive to being handled and are easily set off, while others, such as Trinitrotoluene (TNT) and Semtex are not. Regardless, if you think you have explosive compounds present, it is important to leave and secure the area immediately. Situations such as this require the expertise of properly trained and equipped ordnance disposal teams.

More stable explosives need the shock of an initiator, the second component to PIES. In the scenario presented above, the small, silver cylindrical objects were blasting caps. The blasting caps would be connected to the power source and inserted into the explosive to provide the shock necessary to detonate a more stable, less sensitive explosive compound. This sequence is known as the firing chain.

An IED explodes at the Boston Marathon.

The next component in the PIES acronym is the explosive. Explosives are categorized as either low explosives or high explosives. Low explosives, like gun power, burn rapidly or deflagrate, whereas high explosives, such as those used in military applications, detonate. Low explosives are often found in commonly made devices, like pipe bombs. Low explosives were used in the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, resulting in three deaths and hundreds injured. High explosives are used, for example, in hand grenades and explosive shells. Regardless of whether they are low or high explosives, all explosives are dangerous and should be treated accordingly.

A completed IED showing all four components of PIES.

It is not uncommon for explosives to be manufactured with commonly available chemicals. Practically every hardware store carries the precursor chemicals and other materials needed to create an IED. Every explosive contains is an oxidizer, to cause rapid burning, and a fuel to burn. An example of this is the compound known as ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (ANFO). ANFO was the main explosive used to destroy the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, which resulted in 168 fatalities and nearly 700 casualties. The ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer, served as the oxidizer, providing oxygen for the rapid burn of the fuel, which was a mix of diesel fuel and nitro-methane. All these chemicals, and associated components, were purchased from commercially available sources.

In the scenario presented at the beginning of this piece, acetone, hydrogen peroxide and acid were present to make Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP), a popular explosive compound among terrorists. It was TATP that Richard Reid, the infamous “Shoe Bomber,” tried to ignite on a Paris to Miami bound flight before he was subdued by the other passengers. The mason jars in our fictitious motel room contained the mix of chemicals and resultant TATP sediment, which would be later dried into a powder for use.

The final component to any IED is the switch. The switch can take many forms, from a simple pressure switch to a timing device, such as a digital timer or even a simple alarm clock. More sophisticated on-demand switches would include something like a cell phone, similar to the one found in the notional motel room. With it, one could dial the phone’s number at a moment of opportunity, which in turn would provide the power to initiate the firing chain.

Other components not included in the PIES acronym would be a container for the device and shrapnel. In our motel room scenario, the nuts and bolts would have been used for shrapnel intended to cause death and injury. They were taped to the inside of a briefcase, which would act as the container for all the components. When put together, you would have a lethal IED in the form of an innocuous, everyday item. In some cases, such as with a pipe bomb, the container provides the shrapnel.

What has been presented here is a very basic overview of IED components. In and of themselves they are mostly harmless. But the same concentrated hydrogen peroxide your local hairdresser would use to bleach hair may also be used as an oxidizer. The batteries used to power your child’s toys, could be the power source needed to initiate a firing chain. The key for first responders in defending our nation against terrorist bombings is to first be able to recognize the potential components of an explosive device. Once a bomb has gone off, it’s too late. Recognizing what may be a bomb in the making is not difficult. You only need a little knowledge to know what to look for. Likewise, unfortunately, you only need a little knowledge to create these infernal devices.

There are a number of resources available on the internet and through your local library that provide an awareness of explosives. The best resource I have encountered for first responders is the Incident Response to Terrorist Bombings (IRTB) course, offered by the Department of Homeland Security, through New Mexico Institute for Mining and Technology in Socorro, New Mexico. This class is offered free of charge, inclusive of travel, by the federal government. It offers intensive classroom instruction and live demonstrations of various explosives. For more information on the IRTB, follow this link http://www.emrtc.nmt.edu/training/irtb.php. You can also contact the state point of contact (SPOC) in your respective state who can provide you with information and the application necessary to register and attend the training. You can locate your respective SPOC by following this link http://www.emrtc.nmt.edu/training/statepoc.php.

If you should ever encounter any PIES component, especially if in combination with other components, you need to ask yourself, “Well, Well. What do I have here?”",https://medium.com/homeland-security/ied-awareness-for-first-responders-423fbb5d8912,['Hs Vortex'],2015-11-23 23:15:12.147000+00:00,"['Awareness', 'Terrorism', 'Homeland Security']"
"Trackers, data and apathy. I love the promise of the quantified…","I love the promise of the quantified self, but let’s face it, it’s a pain in the backside. Whether it’s the cost and choice of the tech, the recording of the data or not knowing how to make use of that data — right now it’s too hard for most of us to unlock the insights that will truly benefit us.

A while back I read an article in the Guardian about wearables called The future of wearable technology is not wearables — it’s analysing the data. It’s mostly from Riann Conradie’s talk at CES 2015 about LifeQ. The piece is by Samuel Gibbs and essentially sets up idea that the wearable or tracker isn’t the point it’s what you do with the data that matters. For me this is indeed the issue, as it is with any data. But analysis is only part of the story. There are a few hurdles that still need getting over before we see wide spread and long lasting value from the quantified self.

For the dedicated quantified selfer, things are pretty good. Recording data about many different activities is easier than ever before, as the data, sensors and hackable devices are abundant. But it is still squarely for the enthusiast or hobbyist, as getting truly useful data to analyse requires multiple devices and inventive approaches to recording and analysing the data. Also it takes dedication, as there’s a lot of manual data entry and a reliance on spreadsheets. The rest of us can count our steps and general fitness activities but beyond the simple nudge to do more we are lost. It’s getting there with simpler platforms and smarter tech but we need to see a few more advances before general adoption and widespread personal empowerment.

For me there a three main hurdles that are holding back the quantified self.

Which devices, platforms, or systems do I choose

This one is a killer. What do you choose to track your data? Is it a bespoke device that tracks steps, activity and sleep, or do you stick to the phone, hoping the battery lasts whilst lugging it around. Different data requires different sensors and sources. As yet there aren’t really any single gadgets that actually track all the behavioural data you may want to record. At best you can invest in a platform or eco-system of devices, and hope that it covers all your needs or is easy to extend. Just how many different discreet gadgets will I need? Even for those of us who love gadgets and recording our data, we still struggle with wearables.

The problem is that you need to actively manage all the devices (which is really about the different sensors) to record the data. They need to be with you and you have to make a conscious effort to ensure they are charged and working. It’s a small thing but an essential one. As holes in the data when you don’t track not only effect the data but also effect your morale. There’s something very demoralising about having walked 5Km only to realise you forgot to track it. It’s feels like you’ve been cheated, duped or in someway swindled. Being able to add it manually helps but isn’t the same, it lacks that sense of reward.

Remembering to track or do is one of the biggest problems. It’s the same with any intentional behaviour that’s out of the norm — you need to find ways to nudge yourself to do it. I always think of Jerry Seinfield’s advice for writers; get a wall planner and colour in every day that you write, when you look at it you will not want to see any blanks. Essentially you are nudging yourself. But once those blanks start adding up, it’s easy to fall into a slump. The small failures can end up crushing you when it comes to holes in your data, and there’s no going back to fix it. We need to make it easier for people not to have those holes. Where possible we must make tracking and recording the data simply part of something we are already habitually doing. It’s no good if you need to explicitly do it, because sometimes we won’t. To achieve this, it will have to fit into our routines and rituals. Once upon a time we all wore a watch, it was ubiquitous and almost always with us, now we all carry a phone. But sensors need proximity so we are looking towards the watch again. The thing is, it’s mostly focused on the easiest stuff. It’s the motion based behaviours, and that’s serviced well enough and for most of us already. We can automatically track our movement, our activity and even our heart rates but how does the data from this work with the other data we may want to record?

The more I have to do, the less likely it is that I’ll keep doing it

As others have pointed out it’s hard work to actively keep up the recording of data. Even tracking weight is a manual activity for most people (unless you’ve bought into a system that has smart scales like Withings). Either way it means recording your weight in a format that can later be combined with other data. Plenty of systems allow for different inputs from other devices, but many want to be the record of choice, the single authority for all your data. When you consider all the types of data you may want to record it starts to get crazy. Check out the trackable options on the Apple Health App, looks pretty comprehensive right?

But as many people have pointed out it misses some pretty major health indicators such as menstrual cycle. How’s that for missing a user need for 50% of your audience. Unlikely to be the record of authority for them. There will always be other data sources, other indicators that you want, but may not fit with this or that system.

For most of it there isn’t an automated option, it relies on people knowing the values and inputting them manually. The nutritional data for Caffeine on the Apple Heath App asks you to input milligrams as a data point, I have no idea how many milligrams of caffeine are in my cortado or my flat white. I’m sure there’s a reference somewhere online, if I can be bothered to find it for each nutritional element I feel is important, but really? It’s this kind of thing that causes the trouble, no matter how good our intentions we struggle to maintain new behaviours. We simply can’t adopt 100 new habits all at once and even if some do become habitual, just how much effort/time are you willing to put in? Imagine sourcing and calculating all that nutritional data for everything you eat. Do you even need to? Lets face it all that recording and active self monitoring stops being fun very quickly, unless you’re Nicholas Felton or have a limitless obsessive side. Calories and food intake is the holy grail of the health/dieting sensor market but it’s tricky to automate. There are some interesting new products, like the GoBe calorie counter and the Vessyl that claim to automatically calculate calories. The GoBe is interesting (if it actually works) as it calculates calories post intake, recording what your body has taken onboard rather than being based on product dietary information and guesstimated intake. But it’s another wearable, another bespoke bit of kit to carry, charge and keep on top of. At least it’s a step in the right direction, until we can get smart toilets that do this automatically (health data from sewage). But the real issue is that it only sees half the picture — the calorie data, none of the context of what you ate or when or why. That additional contextual information is likely to reveal far more about the triggers and reasons for dietary blowouts and spikes. As I said it’s tricky, but it shouldn’t stop us trying.

just how many things am I willing to lug around?

We need to get to a situation where we collect all this data automatically and passively, that way it will be easier to achieve much wider adoption. When I don’t have to think about data input it’s way more likely to get tracked. I don’t want to have to tell something manually that this is a ‘workout’ versus me sprinting for the bus. But at the same time I want that sprint for the bus recorded. I don’t want to see the aggregation of my calories for the day, unless I can see when and what was consumed and in what circumstances. I’m never going to have the discipline to ensure I manually capture that, I need the tech to step in. Ultimately it’s about more sophisticated sensors and nuanced data, and we are getting there. By using a mix of many types of data, the relationships between our behaviours and activities, and the relevant indicators we can gain better insight. I need to understand the things that change me in order to change the behaviours that cause them and this needs a diversity of data.

Seeing the data isn’t the same as knowing how to respond to it

This one is the hardest, as it’s where we need the most help from others. Let’s say we’re happy with our devices, habitualised our data tracking and input, then what? How do we get value beyond the nudge to do more exercise and eat less of the bad stuff. Or is that enough? If we want more, we need analysis and insight to help us understand how the changes we make impact us. We also need a little help in choosing which changes will be the most affective and realistic.

Lets start with the analysis part. Thankfully many of the platforms and services create reports and charts to help you analyse the data. Some utilise the social aspect and play on simple competitive tendencies to encourage more or better activity. Others use your data combined with everyone else’s to understand the patterns and trends in their system, some of which is shared back to you to help contextualise your personal data. But often these are fixed views that don’t allow for data exploration or adding more data to them — they tend to be from inside the one system only.

I use run keeper to track my exercise. It’s a useful App and service, it’s on my phone so fits with how I like to workout (running with headphones and music). It’s a very deliberate and intentional form of tracking and coaching activity. I tell it the context (running) and hit start when I set off and stop when I’m done. It works well for measuring that distinct activity and helps by coaching me through my run. I tried using it for other things like cycling but as I cycle for exercise, fun and transport it didn’t work so well. If I chose to record all bike rides (when I remembered) the data was really skewed and the averages and aggregates tended to be depressing. I either needed to pick and choose when to record, or find some way to slice the data later to make it rewarding. It’s not that I didn’t want to record all the activity, rather that the reports for analysis the system supplied, lacked the nuance for me to ask the questions I wanted. Prepackaged generic views of data only ever get you so far —at best they give you well known metrics useful for the simple nudging around basic goals; run more, improve time etc. They are descriptive — how fast am I, how many times did I run last month, how far have I run? But often the answers we want from the analysis are hints to how we can improve. To answer those kinds of questions you need nuanced data, and often a lot more contextual data. That’s when you can start exploring a hypothesis and often bust a few personal myths. Only then does it become possible to experiment and test ideas to improve. To do that you need to be able to analyse data from different sources and explore the associations in that data. To analyse what other environmental or lifestyle activities are influencing you. That’s why the Apple Health App is so verbose, but it doesn’t help me with the analysis or diagnostics, it doesn’t help me spot where I can potentially intervene and make a change.

Intervention requires hard work and analysis, and some kind of insight into the factors that may be influencing me, as well as ideas on how to challenge them. If I don’t have any ideas, where can I get help identifying this critical things that I can change? If I can’t experiment and try out ideas to improve, I may end up just looking at a bunch of metrics that tell me that I’m failing. I’m going to need proactive advice and I’m going to need those nudges. I think that’s where the network and social thinking comes into play. It’s simply no good being a quantified selfer in a vacuum. Yes you will manage to quantify yourself but to make change you need more. Be that in the form of peer encouragement, help, benchmarking or simply seeing what worked for others. This shared and open personal data platform will be key. It needs to also be on my terms not the technologies, as this data is created by and should belong to me. It needs to be a fair exchange if I share this with a larger entity and I need assurances on use and real value in return. There’s some interesting development in this area and personal data rights. Another take on this is the sharing of health data, with startups like Ubiome and the ‘for the greater good’ aspects of the Apple Research Kit.

Of poetry and airplane safety,"Welcome to yet another edition of Dear Know-it-all(DKIA) — the place where I heal the world one question at a time. Our first question today comes from a lucky someone who’s found his soulmate but is a tad apprehensive about how to approach her:

Dear Know-it-all, I’m in love. I knew that she was the one as soon as I landed on her Facebook profile. She was a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend. It was like we were meant to be together. The other three women I was stalking on Twitter and Foursquare paled in comparison. I knew that I couldn’t just send her any old introductory message. So, I toiled, and I toiled and then I toiled some more, then slept for a while, and then there was some more toiling until I came up with this: Roses are red, Violets are blue, I wanna makes, Fraanship with you. What do you think? – Desperately hers

Dear desperately hers,

I must confess that I like your style. There are only two ways to woo a girl — the way of the gentleman and the way of the creep. I like how you’ve honed in on the latter perfectly. Let’s face it, it’s much less work. Imagine bending down to lay your jacket in every Bangalore puddle you come across in this rain! And let’s not forget those skyrocketing dry cleaning bills.

I love the poem. Just one minor bit of feedback — violets aren’t really blue, they’re violet.

Ah, true love! I’m always happy to help it along. Our second question was called-in via phone by someone who has complete disregard for the law:

Dear Know-it-all, I am currently travelling from Mumbai to Delhi by air for the first time. Midway into the flight, the pilot started telling us about the weather outside and the route that he was going to take. A quick check on my phone(luckily I had the required maps offline because it failed to connect to the internet) revealed that it was a very roundabout way of getting there. I quickly waved the air-hostess over with my phone and asked her to tell the pilot to turn the plane around. She stared at me with a look of horror, screamed something about it being every man for himself and jumped out of the plane with her parachute. Now one emergency landing later, I find myself alone in the plane and the authorities seem to be on their way. So, I’m calling you to ask what just happened? – flying newbie

Dear flying newbie,

This’ll teach you to pay attention to the air-hostess when she makes her safety announcements. Studies have shown that mobile phones in airplanes are the biggest cause of airplane crashes, way ahead of pilots doing wheelies after playing beer pong and the riots resulting from the airline running out of vegetarian meals. I hope they lock you up and throw away the key.

Such irresponsible behaviour always gets under my skin!

Well, that’s it for another edition of DKIA, try not to do anything stupid before I return.

Vers Does Not Mean Versus,"Boy: “So what are you into?”

Me: “(insert list *here* and then:) and I’m vers.”

Boy: “Wait, well what do you like more?”

Me: “Well, it depends on the person, their cock, their ass, and how I’m feeling that day.”

Boy: “How strange; well, you look like a bottom.”

I should have this conversation printed on every t-shirt I wear. Apparently, I was unaware that “vers” really meant versus: you are a top or a bottom. Not both. “Vers” is that word that means you’re hip or edgy in bed, and really it’s still code for top. And if you look like a bottom, well that’s that.

WRONG.

I have and will have and am still talking about what I like to do in bed to potential hookups, lovers, friends, strangers (you) etc. I thought it was quite simple, but it’s not. IF I am wanting to engage in anal sex, the position I take is context-dependent.

Being a bottom is a super vulnerable position. If I’m not that comfortable with the person I’m with, I’m less likely to bottom for physical safety concerns. After there was a murder related to Grindr last fall in my town of Ann Arbor, and after leading a workshop on hooking up and physical safety, I am not in a place where I’m willing to open myself up to (too much) harm. And having my face in a pillow with my ass in the air usually doesn’t allow for quick reaction time in case shit hits the fan.

I have also recently arrived to the bottoming scene, and I am learning more about my body, my prostate, what I like, and how I like it. If someone’s dick is too small or too large for what I know I like, I will most likely be in the mood to top. While a good top can work whatever penis they have, not all tops are good tops. And some experiences I wish I could wipe up with a tissue and throw away. Memories, however, are not like cum.

Similarly, not all butts are good butts. Having grown up in the U.S., butts are still instinctively dirty to me. They poop and fart and I think I should stay away from them. They usually smell like booty (in not a good or bad way) and I’ve been socialized to stay far, far away. Socialized to run screaming or to strap a bottle of Febreeze to my thigh just in case. So if someone’s booty reminds me of the asses I was haunted by as a child, there is no way I’ll approach it. . . . But they can approach mine . . . .

And then sometimes I eat way too many beans. Sometimes I eat three bananas in a day. Sometimes I get too excited with the fiber bran muffins. Sometimes I get too ravenous with the meat—the recently non-vegetarian in me gets a little wild around new types of meat (pun intended). Sometimes I’m nervous or anxious and have diarrhea. Sometimes I am having a good bum day. Sometimes I’m having a bad bum day. My butt is the more variable component in the dick-ass equation and so some days I feel more like bottoming or topping or not engaging in anal based on this.

But I also don’t just have sex for me. I have myself for that. So if I’m going to physically engage another person in sex, I like to know what they like. If they like something a lot (say, bottoming), I can get off on that and assume the appropriate role (say, top). For me the sex I have would get boring if I did the same thing every time. Mixing it up, trying new things, and changing old habits spice up sex, and I like Sriracha on everything: let me feel the burn.

Even this is too basic of a conversation for me. Sometimes, and quite often, I want to fuck someone and then be fucked by them. I don’t know when or how me saying that I’m “vers” meant that I was referring to a dichotomy, but I do not approve! For me, being vers is being versatile. I can top, I can bottom, I can neither, I can both, I can do other things.

I’m queer for a reason and it’s not to reproduce over and over how straight people have sex. I’m not here to reproduce normative sex. I am not one for strict categories. The moment when “vers” turns into “top” and “queer” turns into “gay” turns into “straight,” I know that my penis and ass have imploded into an oblivion of angst.

IED Awareness: The Blast Zone,"In this companion piece to my previous article, IED Awareness for First Responders, I cover the basics of what every first responder should know about the area around a bomb which is affected by the blast. This area is known as the blast zone.

Many are only mistakenly concerned about shrapnel, those small, solid bits and pieces of a bomb, which radiate out from the epicenter of a blast, that can kill and maim. However, there is far more to be concerned with. Many injuries and deaths associated with bombings are a result of other forces within the blast zone. Certainly, shrapnel is of great concern, as it can travel great distances at very high velocity. But one must also consider other forces within the blast zone, namely heat and over-pressure.

One characteristic behind explosives is that they instantly release great amounts of energy. Physics tells us any time that happens; a vast amount of heat is generated and radiates outward from the blast. This is why detonation is always accompanied by a flash of light, the telltale sign of rapid energy release. The heat from this energy release can reach over one thousand degrees, and can cause severe injury and death to anybody within the blast zone. A secondary effect from such blasts is the ignition of flammable material in the area. So, first responders are not only immediately concerned with the injured, they must often contend with controlling resultant fires.

An example of heat released in the form of light. The shock wave is visible as a semi-transparent outline around the resultant light.

Over-pressure is an invisible force which radiates out from a blast. The laws of physics also tell us that when something is heated up, it expands. The same holds true of air in the blast zone. This expansion of air radiates out from the blast at great speed. The leading edge of this movement of air is called the shock wave. As the shock wave passes by, it creates an extremely rapid increase in air pressure. If large enough, this over-pressure can knock down walls or buildings not built to resist such pressure. According to the Department of Defense, even 1 psi of over-pressure can shatter windows. When people are hit by the shock wave, the sudden increase in air pressure can not only knock them down, but can cause massive internal injuries. As little at 5 psi over-pressure can rupture eardrums, and a 15 psi increase will begin to cause lung damage. An over-pressure of 35–45 psi has been shown to cause death in 1% of people, where an over-pressure between 55–65 psi will result in fatalities in 99% of people.

Another phenomenon associated with over-pressure is what happens when normal air pressure returns to the blast zone. After the blast wave propagates out from the blast, it leaves a void in the air pressure. As the air pressure rapidly returns to normal, it causes a reverse wave of pressure which can cause additional secondary blast effects. As the pressure wave moves back, it can drag objects, such as broken glass and other debris toward the blast epicenter, causing further injuries and damage. This process of over-pressure moving out, and the subsequent return to normal air pressure in the blast zone, often takes only fractions of a second to occur.

It should be noted that blast effects occurring in enclosed areas, such as a building or bus, are greatly enhanced due to the effects of containment. Objects such as walls or shaped charges, which direct blast waves, can also increase the lethality and damage potential of IEDs.

How close one can safely be to an explosion depends on many factors. The amount and type of explosive charge used, composition of shrapnel, and the effects of over-pressure all factor into the equation. The chart below from the Department of Homeland Security provides some general guidelines on evacuation distances for various types of IEDs.

The distances in the chart above are minimum distance recommendations. It can be reasonably stated to get as far away as practicable from any potential IED. A good rule of thumb is that if you can see the bomb, the bomb can see you. Don’t stick around thinking you may get to witness a cool explosion and then duck out of the way just in time to avoid injury. Explosion velocities of some compounds are measured in thousands of feet per second. There is no way you could react fast enough. If shrapnel doesn’t maim or kill you, the over-pressure may.

This article presents only very basic information regarding blast zone awareness. There are a number of resources available on the internet and through your local library that provide an awareness of IEDs and blast zones. The Department of Homeland Security is an excellent on-line resource to learn more. You can follow this link to their Office of Bombing Prevention web site: http://www.dhs.gov/obp for more information.

The best resource I have encountered for first responders is the Incident Response to Terrorist Bombings (IRTB) course, offered by the Department of Homeland Security, through New Mexico Institute for Mining and Technology in Socorro, New Mexico. The IRTB course is offered free of charge, inclusive of travel, by the federal government. It offers intensive classroom instruction and live demonstrations of various explosives.

"Infinite universes, the meaning of life and Rick and Morty","“Nobody belongs anywhere, nobody exists on purpose, everyone’s going to die. Come watch TV?” The philosophy of Rick and Morty. By Swéta Rana

“Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here.”

If you’ve never watched Rick and Morty, buy now. I’m serious. It’s not a vague suggestion. It’s an imperative. Open a new tab, search for it, and order it right now.

Hey, what are you doing? You shouldn’t be reading this sentence right here! You should be buying Rick and Morty!

My friend pestered me similarly for over a year before she finally got me to watch it (sheer apathy on my part). And boy, I’m so glad she did. Rick and Morty is many things: an animation, a comedy, an AdultSwim production, a magnificent force of sheer genius… It’s not your average cartoon.

Rick, a hyper-intelligent scientist, and his nervous grandson Morty, are both voiced by co-creator Justin Roiland. The former regularly drags the latter along on his adventures. This set up, à la Futurama, means crazy stuff can happen courtesy of ‘science’ — think spaceships, inter-dimensional hijinks, aliens, fantasy worlds and time travel. And of the many scientists out there, Rick is of the booze-swillin’, swear-spoutin’, powder-snortin’, orgy-havin’ variety. This cartoon certainly ain’t for kids.

Co-creators Roiland and Dan Harmon and have extensive comedic experience, and many of the show’s hilarious jokes were entirely improvised. But the humour isn’t the only reason I love Rick and Morty. The thing that really does it for me is the philosophical speculations. Wait, please, don’t stop reading! I’ll explain.

Rick and Morty extensively explores the common philosophical and scientific theory of parallel universes. In brief: if there is no limit to space or time, then space-time must start repeating itself, because matter can only be arranged in a finite number of ways. If there are an endless number of possible worlds, then anything that can happen has already happened.

When Rick accidentally turns all humans on Earth into mutated aliens, he uses a device to transport himself and Morty to another universe. In this universe, humankind is perfectly safe — and Rick and Morty have just died in a freak accident. ‘Our’ Rick is nonchalant about stepping into this universe and continuing life as before, but the immediate and existential horror that Morty experiences as he buries his own corpse is palpable and utterly chilling. Maybe his life doesn’t matter at all — a second, third or billionth Morty could just step right in to take his place.

Overwhelming? Yes. Cynical. Yes. But Rick and Morty doesn’t intend to depress or alarm its audience. It acknowledges the randomness, uncertainty and meaninglessness of the universe — but it also asserts that the universe’s meaning doesn’t have to matter, that it’s the meaning you make yourself that counts.

Rick is a jaded man bordering on total misanthropy, but his deep affection for Morty redeems him. He doesn’t feel the need to find an innate meaning in the universe, because he has parties and experiments and friends.

As for Morty, in one episode he summarises his worldview very succinctly: “Nobody belongs anywhere, nobody exists on purpose, everyone’s going to die. Come watch TV?”

We live in a time of great uncertainty. A deluge of information bombards us daily; sometimes it feels like our world is collapsing around us. Maybe it is. Perhaps it’s collapsed before? Rick and Morty’s suggested response: try not to worry about what you can’t change. Right now we’re in this universe, and that’s all we need to focus on. Do something that makes you feel good. Hang out with the people you love. Go on a heroic adventure. Have a party, or read a book. Maybe watch a new TV show.

Fashion Tech brought to Life,"Anouk Wipprecht is an artist, designer, and engineer. Her work entwines the worlds of fashion and technology and challenges our relationship with the garments we wear. She explores robotic couture, experiments with sensory experiences, and creates futuristic fashion that empathizes with how we perceive the world and interact with it.

Anouk’s worked with groups like the Black Eyed Peas, Cirque du Soleil, AutoDesk, and is now at Microsoft Research Labs as an artist in residence. Thanks to a collaboration with CODAME ART+TECH, we were lucky enough to have her stop by Salesforce last week to speak and showcase her work. I also sat down with her to talk about her process and learn more about her journey into the emerging world of fashion tech.

These are the highlights —

The Journey to Fashion Tech

Photo by Ryan Scott

Anouk began as a fashion design student in The Netherlands, passionate about what people could say by the clothing they wore. As soon she arrived to her studies, however, she developed a strong dissatisfaction with the practices and philosophies of the fashion industry that taught to mass manufacture design and deprive people of the best quality garments.

“It felt a little bit evil in a way. I expected fashion to be empathic, a way to help humans understand each other better. The industry itself can be a pretty evil machine in many ways.”

In a search for inspiration, Anouk found robots,

“On the other hand, you have robots — technology which is perceived as evil by the means of science fiction but I felt different…there was something wrong here.”

Fabric wasn’t expressive enough. Anouk wanted to make something that felt fluid, personalized and interactive. “As opposed to having an analog dress that could only express a single emotion or message”, she asked, “wouldn’t it be remarkable to have clothing that could communicate with us… and change?” At the core, she discovered, that this was something she couldn’t find in her fashion studies alone but could find in technology, arduinos, and robots.

“I saw interesting systems that could monitor us…nurture us. I wanted those [systems] to not only be in the devices we carried but also in the garments we wore.”

When her instructors first saw her with robot micro-controllers they kicked Anouk out of class and told her it wasn’t fashion and that robotics and fashion together wouldn’t be accepted. Nevertheless, she left to Sweden to pursue her growing interest in fashion tech and began learning interaction design, programming, and engineering.

Courage to be Different

I was fascinated by Anouk’s inclination towards risk and experimentation. In Silicon Valley, risk (and failure) have become suitable norms. For Anouk, however, her dissonance wasn’t as accepted. As she continued to develop her craft, she attributed her courage to be different on the innate basis of being human. As she told me,

“I think [risk and experimentation] is what makes a human. Otherwise innovation and development wouldn’t happen. [It’s about] being able to act on your impulses and having a strong belief in what the world should look like.”

Work & Inspiration

During her presentation, Anouk showcased two of her latest projects: A jaw-dropping 3d printed spider dress and an interactive installation that revealed how we view personal space and proximity to others based on body-tracking sensors. Both the dress and the installation touched deeply on themes of subconscious and brought greater self-awareness and empathy for those interacting with the projects.

Photo by Ryan Scott

As she presented the spider dress, she explained it’s interactive functionality. When you approach the dress it reacts — the legs on the dress expand and contract, moving elegantly or aggressively, responding to how you approach.

“If a cat doesn’t like you, you get a claw. If a human doesn’t like you, you hear about it from someone else.”

There is a real candor in animal interactions that is often concealed in the way humans relate to one another. To have our our internal feelings exposed can be strange, even frightening but it also raises questions about human nature, authenticity, and our own self-awareness.

When asked about the inspiration for her creations, Anouk responded,

“I don’t like to do things twice. I’m always on the search for something else. It’s mostly curiosity that’s driving it. If you have a curious mind, you will always be able to seek new things out from the existing world. Sometimes you blow things up and sometimes things work out. It’s all about curiosity.”

Being a Female Engineer

Photo by Todd Matthews

The field of engineering is still largely male-dominated. I wanted to get Anouk’s thoughts on breaking into the field and what she’s experienced first hand as a woman engineer.

“If I’m at a conference or other places with technical people, it can often be 90–95% male. At a lot of conferences, I’m the only female speaker. Certain companies say they want to be 50/50 by a certain year but they still have a lot to overcome.”

She continued,

“On an individual level, it has a lot to do with attitude…Perhaps it’s something that society has pushed us towards.”

Anouk admitted that the topic is complicated. The work that she is doing however is not purely engineering but instead at the intersection of engineering and design — a locale that I believe will only become more significant in the future.

The Artist in Residence Experience

This week Salesforce debuted it’s Artist in Residence program, working with our artist and innovator Reza Ali. Having been an artist in residence at Intel, Autodesk, and now Microsoft Research Labs, I asked Anouk to help shed some insight into how we could provide an invaluable experience for the artists who walked through our doors.",https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/fashion-tech-brought-to-life-c82cfce6a84,['Ian Schoen'],2015-12-18 18:24:41.480000+00:00,"['Events', 'Fashion', 'Art']"

The Architects of Dungeons & Dragons,"“When my daughter was eight years old, I killed her character in a group of 15 people at a convention. You could have heard a pin drop from a mile away.”

I’m talking to Bill Webb about Dungeons & Dragons. His company, Frog God Games, has been publishing adventures, supplements, and other D&D-related content for more than a decade.

“We have a stock philosophy in our house, and this is the rule: everybody rolls dice in front of everybody, so there’s no cheating. Most people who cheat in D&D aren’t the players; they’re the Dungeon Masters cheating so they don’t have to kill characters,” says Webb. “But if the game’s not hard, it’s not fun, and the rewards are cheapened.”

Dungeons & Dragons, or D&D as it’s known colloquially, is a tabletop role-playing game wherein a group of friends gather around a table with their Dungeon Master. The players assume the roles of fictional avatars — warriors, sorcerers, thieves, bards — with rich backstories and unique skills and abilities. They keep track of these characteristics, as well as their inventories, and, most crucially, their stats (such as health, intelligence, and even charisma) on their character sheets.

The Dungeon Master — also known as the game master, the GM, or the DM — sits at the head of the table, usually hunched behind a cardboard divider, which hides their maps, rulebooks, dice, and notes. The Dungeon Master is cloaked in mystery. It’s their job to insert the players’ characters into a fictional world, usually, though certainly not always, inspired by creations like J. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth, George R.R. Martin’s Westeros, and the Hyborian world of Robert E. Howard’s Conan the Barbarian.

At the beginning of a campaign, the characters are presented with a plot-hook or a quest that will lead them on to bigger and better adventures. The Dungeon Master might initiate the first session by telling the group that they are a band of fortune-seekers and do-gooders, brought together by a desire for adventure. They might then elaborate that for the past three weeks, the party has traveled away from the peace and quiet of the Realm and into the wilderness of the Borderlands to join those who live there in their fight against the forces of chaos.

At the end of this prologue, the Dungeon Master might provide a call to action: “Finally, on the morning of the eighteenth day, you and your companions approach a towering Keep with blue-clad men-at-arms guarding the gate. They call out, ‘State your business.’ Looking around, you can see a number of faces eagerly peering down at you from the walls of the small fortress. What do you do?”

The above is a loose summary of the beginning of the classic D&D module B2 — The Keep on the Borderlands, written by Gary Gygax, the game’s creator. For many who grew up playing D&D in the 1980s, this adventure is the gold standard for what a Dungeons & Dragons adventure should be. In under thirty pages, Gygax provides the Dungeon Master with all the tools necessary to run an adventure that will provide more than twenty hours of play: there are villains, shop keepers, secret plots, a mad hermit, a tribe of lizard men, tips for new DMs, highly detailed maps, and a number of secret treasures and magical items that the players may or may not discover, depending on the choices they make during their adventures.

You can think of D&D as the origin of every video game RPG experience — it’s what Bethesda Softworks, the creators of the Elder Scrolls series, strive for when they build a vast region like Skyrim. In D&D, the modules are the software and the reference material, and the Dungeon Master is the supercomputer that renders the images and scenarios, while enforcing the rules of the game world. The DM also ensures that no matter what the players decide to do, they feel free to explore without ever encountering the flat walls of a Potemkin village, or the flat dialog of a non-player character who only exists so that the world doesn’t seem eerily unpopulated.

The best Dungeon Masters invest years and years into ensuring that the worlds of their D&D games can achieve this dream of total immersion. They’ll write backstories for the lowliest barkeep, and draw detailed continental maps with thousands of points of interest and notes about the local animals, foliage, and weather patterns of the various regions.

For some DMs, pre-written adventures like Gygax’s The Keep on the Borderlands serve as a launching pad into a creative journey that can span decades, as they go on to create fantastic worlds and sprawling stories of their own. This was the case for Vince Howard, a claims analyst in central Missouri who has been playing D&D since 1978, when, at the age of ten, he and a group of schoolyard friends played The Tower of Zenopus. It was shortly after that first foray that he decided to become a Dungeon Master himself.

In the beginning, Howard was running mostly pre-written adventures, but over time, he began to enrich the content of the modules he purchased. As he wistfully recalls, “It was Judges Guild [a third-party publisher of D&D adventures] that got me into game writing. They put out a good product, but it was broad strokes. They gave you a great idea, but then they were very terse. It was ‘here’s the monster, here’s the treasure, here’s the magic item or trap.’ You had to flesh it out yourself. It really pushed you as a DM. You had a kernel of a great idea in front of you, and you were either going to enjoy that kind of product because you were going to make it your own, or you weren’t going to like it because it didn’t make sense. For me it was an opportunity to take somebody else’s work and polish it up.”

Howard spent his time filling in backstories, figuring out why there was a monster hanging out in a dungeon guarding some invaluable treasure. In his eyes, T1 — The Village of Hommlet is the pinnacle of adventure writing, and functions as a yardstick when evaluating his own work. “Everyone had a backstory: the wizard and his warrior buddy, the guy that ran the tavern, the local trader … there were all these stories that your players might never find out about, but it would breathe life into that village, into that adventure, and it made me excited to run it.”

“If all you’re going to do is sit around and referee combat for hours, anybody can do that. You might as well ref little league soccer.”

Howard’s first published adventure, Ryubix Manor, is the manifestation of a twenty-year quest to create material with this level of depth. “The thing that appealed to me as a GM was reading through good modules that told a story to me, and then gave me the opportunity to present that story to the players, and maybe they’d figure it out and maybe they wouldn’t. If the dungeon leaves me cold, then what is that gonna do when I put it on the table for the players?” Howard asks. “I’m writing to the GM. When they read it, I want them to go, ‘Oooh, here’s all the stuff the players aren’t gonna know. Am I gonna give it to them in rumors? Are they gonna figure it out? If all you’re going to do is sit around and referee combat for hours, anybody can do that. You might as well ref little league soccer.”

In the spring of 2014, after a few rejections from larger publishers, Howard decided to bring his work to Kickstarter. With the support of ninety-nine tabletop gamers who shared his vision, he was able to bring his almost one hundred-page haunted house adventure to print with full color maps and professional illustrations. “Oh, highlight of my life,” he told me of his first successful campaign. “I’ve done a lot of wonderful things, but when Ryubix Manor funded — highlight of my life.” Howard has since published two shorter modules: Wishtaker and City of the Lich. And his wife, inspired by the community that formed around the modules, went on to produce a leather-bound tome of potion recipes, Liber Elixirium (The Essential Guide To Potions and Oils).

Bill Webb — the one who offed his daughter at the beginning of the piece — started playing D&D around the same time as Howard; he can’t quite recall whether it was 1976 or 1977, but he knows it was definitely the first iteration of the game. That version is known to the hardcore “grognards” who played it simply as “White Box,” named for the color of its packaging. Unlike Howard, Webb never used any store-bought materials, preferring to create both his adventures and the world they were set in from scratch.

“I was the Game Master growing up,” he says, explaining how he came to publish Rappan Athuk, a 676-page self-described “mega-dungeon.” “So I had probably 1,500 pages of stuff in notebooks, and during my college years, my friends and I typed up a lot of my handwritten notes when we weren’t chasing girls or drinking beer. So, I had a 400-page, typewritten set of notes about this big dungeon and the original twenty-six levels of it mapped out. It’s grown a lot over the past twenty-five years — it has like fifty-five levels now.”

For Webb, challenge is everything. He prides his work on being some of the most deadly in the business, and points to S1 — Tomb of Horrors, a module that most players scoff at as an impossibly difficult toy for sadist Dungeon Masters, as his gold-standard of adventure design. He believes that the game has softened up over the years, allowing players to survive things that would have resulted in a Total Party Kill (TPK) in earlier editions.

“We’re universally panned as the hardest, most killer dungeon ever written. But I’m actually glad. That makes me happy.”

His second company, Necromancer Games, has the slogan “Third Edition Rules, First Edition Feel,” which points to his driving philosophy. “If the players don’t have to use their brains to be successful, I believe it’s a failure on my part,” he says. “A DM will read my stuff and be like, ‘Oh my god, everybody’s gonna die,’ but usually, if players are careful and they use their noggins, they’re gonna be able to navigate my dungeons. People need brain exercise. They can’t not pay attention. We’re universally panned as the hardest, most killer dungeon ever written. But I’m actually glad. That makes me happy.”

This mentality explains his ambivalence towards dispatching his daughter Jillian’s character at that convention some years ago. Jillian is thirteen now, and her current character, Kit, who she’s played consistently for the past six years, is a level-seven cleric. “I finally have ‘raise dead,’” she says, referring to the spell that can bring deceased adventurers back to life.

Following in her father’s footsteps, Jillian has started to DM games with family, friends, and even strangers at conventions. Webb reports that she’s built up some notoriety in that convention circuit. “I don’t think I’ve ever had anyone make it out of one of my convention games alive,” Jillian says. “I’m always rooting for the players, but they always head into trouble.” And bringing the conversation back to the real arbiter of every D&D game, she adds, “Everybody just sort of rolls unlucky.”",https://medium.com/kickstarter/total-party-kill-3898fb82b5fb,['Willis Plummer'],2015-08-02 02:28:40.872000+00:00,"['Fantasy', 'Dungeons And Dragons', 'Gaming']"
The working world will never be the same again…,"My first annual review was imminent, and I was excited. This was the opportunity I’d been waiting for. There were whispers that my salary was going to be negotiated, and I had prepared my case inside out. I felt I’d done well, excellent even, in my first year of employment. The organisation was small but growing, and I was working hard to put my stamp on the role. A good old meaty chat with my boss would be the perfect opportunity to discuss my contribution, my progress and my future.

I arrived to work on the day, a little nervous but confident in my preparation. The day dragged on but 3pm arrived, and there was a knock on the door.

‘The boss will see you now.’

As I walked into the office, the colour must’ve drained from my face. On the table was a piece of paper, written, printed, letter-headed and signed. I sat down opposite my boss, and I will never forget how he slid my entire year’s work across the table with his middle and index finger. On the paper was a brief note of thanks and my revised salary. Five minutes later I was back at my desk.

It was at my desk, that day, that I had my first original thought. I saw my life stretched out in front of me, and I saw my life’s work for what it really was: a choice. I realised that if I continued to be on the wrong side of the table, no amount of preparation would determine what that piece of paper read. Had I already relinquished control over my life, aged 23, to the powers that be? After being shepherded from school to university, and from university into employment, was I going to sit back and watch my future being slid across the table for the best part of my working life?

My review prompted me to read widely on subjects from entrepreneurship to lifestyle design in an effort to understand more about the ideas, philosophies and histories pertaining to ‘work’, that thing that occupies so much of our time. I discovered a tremendous discourse around the subject of what we do with our lives that I had never been exposed to before. In this new world, business and pleasure were not mutually exclusive, but conjoined, and pursued as one. I was inspired to start my first micro-business with my girlfriend alongside my day job, and earned enough money to quit and move to London in pursuit of something more.

Here’s what I know for sure.

The world of work is in tectonic transition. Imagine a bouncing ball. It falls from the height of its existing trajectory, hits the earth, and is propelled onwards and upwards onto a completely new path. We live, right now, in the exact moment where the ball makes contact with the ground. At this moment, both paths, the past and the future, exist as one. Behind us is 200 years of a professional paradigm born from industry, the Old Work Order, and ahead of us is a world of work that looks very different, the New Work Order. Alas, here we are, smack bang in the middle of both.

It is vital, if we are to fully exploit the opportunities of the New Work Order, to understand how, and why, we got here. If I am to successfully argue that working practices are changing, you should have some idea as to where they came from in the first place in order to fully appreciate your own contextual significance.

The Old Work Order.

The OWO comes from industry, and a core principle of industrial labour organisation is to reduce the role of human input in the production process to a set of prescribed instructions, which can be easily learned and followed. In other words, industrial labour processes are designed to make human beings replaceable. Is it any surprise that two thirds of UK employees admit to being disengaged at work? As such, the OWO has come to be characterised by corporate apathy and professional stagnation.

Our factories are less recognisable these days. New ones aren’t built with stone and brick but with glass and steel, and they aren’t cramped and stuffy, but lofty and spacious. The City of London is dominated by gigantic glass mega-structures, designed to reduce as much as possible the distance between the natural outdoors, and the unnatural human environment on the inside. We long to feel connected to something more natural, something more innate, and the leaders of the Old Work Order know it.

But make no mistake, the principles of industrial labour are alive and well. Our schools and universities are designed with the specific intention of making us fit for purpose in the OWO, and when we enter the world of work we fill our CVs with evidence of our replaceable skills, so that we can be employed to perform replaceable tasks for a company that exists, so it would seem, to make its owners richer.

For many of us, the OWO exists as a set of expectations and assumptions, along with an action plan designed to help you survive and thrive within it. We know the ideology, the chances are that we were raised with its expectations and assumptions, and we probably followed the action plan. The problem is that this system is not designed with authentic personal fulfillment in mind. Human satisfaction is not the end goal of the OWO, and it never has been.

Over time, the principles of the OWO have been absorbed by our society, and have shaped our cultural understanding of ‘work’ as something we wear a suit for, something we take a holiday from, even somewhere that we go to that is separate from our life at home. We expect to be separated from our friends and families, we expect to be given 20 days off a year, we expect to wait in line for a promotion and, most alarmingly, we expect not to enjoy ourselves. These assumptions and expectations have become our cultural normalities, and we build our lives and careers in reaction to them.

The End of the Institutional Age.

The 20th century was certainly the age of the institution (see this TED talk on institutions vs. collaborations). Institutions were the primary means of organising resources in order to ‘get stuff done’, or produce a coherent, sustainable and valuable output. Institutions run using an organising principle of centralisation, that is a single set of rules, systems and processes that must be followed as a means to the end of some explicit goal.

Institutions could justify this centralised structure because they owned the factors of production, the means of value creation and by extension profit creation. Regular people did not own the factors of production, nor the means for value creation, regular people need money, so regular people work for the people who own the means of making money.

Over time trust is developed between the people and the institutions, and we plod along happily. We work for you, you give us salaries, pensions, job security, holidays and healthcare, we get drunk at the Christmas party and all is well. This will stay the same until one day when perhaps something happens when institutional trust is eroded en masse, new means of labour organisations are invented, or new access to previously inaccessible value creating resources come along.

Or, all of the above. At the same time.

Value Creation: Now Comes Pocket Sized.

The world is cyclical, and the western world is experiencing a technological transformation as revolutionary as the one that sparked the Industrial Revolution some 200 years ago. With the advent of the Internet, the harnessing of the Internet cheaply, quickly and widely, and the growth of smart phone usage, we are now inextricably connected.

Connection creates value: ideas are spread, opinions voiced, and new opportunities for value creation are born.

The most powerful tool of value creation that has ever existed now fits into our pockets.

At the same time as increased individual empowerment, economic and social forces of vast magnitude are eroding trust in institutions. It’s institutions that caused the financial meltdown where millions of people lost their savings and their livelihoods, institutions that wage wars they struggle to justify. The idea that companies and governments will take care of us is losing resonance, and becoming rapidly outdated.

We need to look after ourselves.

We are living in a world of work mid-bounce. Survival will be determined by those who understand and embrace where the New Work Order is heading. The question, then, is this:

How do we survive and thrive in the New Work Order?

The New Work Order brings with it a new set of prerequisites that are fundamental for its successful navigation. The Connected Economy demands that we bring something new to the table, beyond simply compliance and the ability to routinely follow instructions.

Let’s take a look at this visually:

2.0 Triangle

The Old Work Order is 1.0. Our CVs, for so long our passport to employment, are an enshrinement of 1.0 and, by extension, the OWO. But 1.0 is no longer enough. It is necessary, but insufficient. Most significantly, 1.0 is replaceable.

The NWO is 2.0. Seth Godin, for so many a prophetic figure, affirms that success in the NWO is determined by our art: that which makes each of us unique and distinct. The goal of our efforts in the NWO is not to refine our replaceable skills, but to create value through self-expressive action.

“The job is what you do when you are told what to do. The job is showing up at the factory, following instructions, meeting spec, and being managed. Someone can always do your job a little better or faster or cheaper than you can. The job might be difficult, it might require skill, but it’s a job. Your art is what you do when no one can tell you exactly how to do it. Your art is the act of taking personal responsibility, challenging the status quo, and changing people.”

Re-imagining Value and Work.

The NWO requires us to fundamentally re-imagine some prominent concepts, for which our current understanding no longer serves us. I’m going to concentrate briefly on two of the most important: value, and work.

Value:

Your Value is everything in the NWO. You survive and thrive in the NWO by becoming valuable. We become valuable by creating valuable things, learning valuable skills, having valuable experience, and building valuable relationships with other valuable people. By far the most valuable thing in the NWO is you. You are your own most precious asset.

1.0 is necessary but common, so it is not valuable. 2.0 is rare, thus valuable. Success in the NWO depends on how effectively you can cultivate your 2.0 characteristics. Initiative, the top of the triangle, is the rarest and most valuable characteristic you can have in the NWO, and is Seth Godin’s (there he is again) ‘7th Imperative’ for success.

“The world is changing too fast. Without the sparks of initiative, you have no choice but to simply react to the world. Without the ability to instigate and experiment, you are stuck, adrift, waiting to be shoved.”

Initiative is the energy currency of the NWO, as ATP is the energy currency of a cell. Initiative isn’t waiting for instructions, and it’s not asking for permission. Initiative is the act of doing without as you are within, in other words, doing stuff that you believe deserves to be done and sharing it with the world.

Taking risks, taking initiative, cultivating your creativity, experimenting, being curious, innovative and collaborative, these are the keystones of becoming valuable in the New Work Order.

Work:

As I mentioned before, work in the NWO is not something that you wear a suit to, and request permission to take time off from. In the NWO, work is any activity that builds your value. It is the word we can use to describe the process of appreciating our value, and any action that does this is our work. Writing this blog post is work. Reading every Seth Godin book is work. Going to an Escape School Meetup is work. Initiating independent and collaborative projects is work. Work is whatever you decide it is. As long as you do it, and as long as it makes you valuable, it is work.

The Self-Directed Career.

Think of making yourself valuable like building a house. Nobody is going to pay you to build your own house. You have to do it for free, and you have to do it to the best of your abilities, but you can build it however you want. You should inform and educate yourself on how to build your house, equip yourself with the necessary tools, and get to work. As you build your house, you are creating value where before there was none. You have created an asset, and all it cost you was your time and energy. Unlike a real house, you don’t need to be the finished article to start leveraging your value in the NWO. As your value appreciates, you will have the ability to initiate multiple opportunities for monetisation, and you can use your entrepreneurial skills to establish numerous streams of income.

The Self-Directed Career is the New Work Order. It is by far the most powerful opportunity for anybody looking to leave the Old Work Order behind and embrace our new trajectory. It is even more powerful than starting a business. A business is a ‘thing’, an entity that exists outside of you, even if it is your creation. A Self-Directed Career focuses not on the extrinsic, but the intrinsic. It is the process of transforming your career from the pursuit of a pay cheque into the pursuit of self-actualisation.

I am a Self-Directed Careerist in the New Work Order. It is my personal mission to decode the process from ground zero to self-sustainability and beyond, and to help people connect who they are with what they do along the way.",https://medium.com/21st-century-career/how-is-the-working-world-changing-129c6d6e49c5,['Will Reynolds'],2015-08-20 14:45:10.427000+00:00,"['Culture', 'Work Reimagined', 'Careers']"
A whimper in the desert,"A whimper in the desert

Denis Villeneuve’s Sicario , a brilliantly dark drug-war thriller set in a desolate, parched desert where nothing can grow

Let us bring up again that old Eliot chestnut, “the world won’t end with a bang, but with a whimper”, to remind us that Sicario begins with a bang (or rather, several), as a FBI SWAT team enters an Arizona charnel house of horrors, only to end, two hours later (and this is no spoiler) with a distraught, whimpering FBI agent asking what did she just live through. We can ask the same question ourselves: what were we just hit with?

Sicario systematically puts up a genre scaffold, a framework that lures the viewer in, and just as systematically tears it down with each new development until its nominal heroine - a door-busting, no-nonsense FBI agent named Kate Macer and played vibrantly by Emily Blunt - is left hanging from what’s left by the skin of a finger nail. (It’s a metaphor. There are no cliffhangers like that in the film.)

The warning this is going to happen is, actually, perfectly enunciated by Benicio del Toro about a third of the way into the film: “Nothing will make sense to your American ears, and you will question everything you do. But, in the end, you will understand.”

And understand we do, in Denis Villeneuve’s brilliantly dark and almost hopeless drug-war thriller, synthesizing a resolutely contemporary take on one of American cinema’s most hardened tropes, the twisty thriller following a hero in search of justice.

Taylor Sheridan’s script is incredibly ambitious in its attempt to dramatize the many tentacles of contemporary drug trafficking, using Ms. Blunt’s character as his way: an agent who has been on the frontline of chasing drug and people traffickers assigned to an undercover operation to neutralize a Mexican kingpin where the book everything is supposed to be done by has just gone out the window.

The script does falter uneasily when it tries to give a voice to the Mexicans who suffer the most from the drug war — a subplot about a local cop on the take is so bare-bones it’s almost cringeworthy, and nearly all of the characters on the Latino side of the border are purely functional archetypes not given much thought.

But Mr. Sheridan packs a mean punch when it comes to fingering the political aspects the thing takes on the American side, designing a quicksand swampland of loose morals and means-justifying-the-end ironically set in the desert lands of Arizona, Texas and Mexico.

Roger Deakins’ roving camera, a surveillance object if there ever was one, moves implacably, almost inexorably above and on the surface of this desert, where derelict cars do double duty as entrances to a hellish underworld, coyote holes into which Kate is about to fall through like Alice on the other side of the looking-glass. Down is now up, left is now right, “truth, justice and the American way” quietly devolving into an almost lawless New Wild West, as seen through the get-the-job-done credo of Kathryn Bigelow’s Iraq war films and the cool, professional sheen of Michael Mann’s contemporary noirs.

Mr. Villeneuve may clearly be trespassing onto Steven Soderbergh territory here; Sicario could be a more focussed Traffic minus the mosaic plotting, but in fact there’s more in common with the Canadian helmer’s earlier Prisoners in the earnestness with which it approaches its tale (though, for my money, Sicario is the better film).

I can’t help but think of Mr. Villeneuve as an equivalent to Christopher Nolan: in an American film landscape where most everyone seems concerned with making entertainment, both directors are aiming for a scope and approach that is serious, certainly thoughtful, occasionally stern in its moralist approach, but trying to approach serious issues within an arena of genre filmmaking while refusing simple, black and white dichotomies. Sicario is notable for its refusal to sugarcoat the pill — there’s a starkness, a darkness to the film, borne out of the disenchantment in its tale, of its realization there can be no escape from this vicious circle.

Unlike the liberal thrillers of the 1970s (another reference all too present), where things were done with a view to making sure things got better, Sicario offers no easy fixes, no comforting solutions; this isn’t going away and all we can do is contain it. The beating tempo editor Joe Walker creates highlights the fact that every new piece of the puzzle isn’t going to fit neatly, everything is a challenge that changes the image you’re trying to build. Halfway through the film’s taut two-hour running time, you’ve lost all landmarks and are merely being buffeted back and forth by the twisting and turning plot, left as much in the dark as its heroine is, even though the director can’t occasionally help tease the viewer with information hidden from her. After all, everything happens above Kate’s paygrade.

Not everything works in Sicario, for sure; it certainly may not be the most original or illuminating take on its hot-button subject. But it’s a smart, thoughtful, thought-provoking one, and above all a formally masterful feat of control and command from the director and his crew, turning the landscapes of Arizona and Mexico into a sort of parched, desolate, apocalyptic territory where nothing can survive but bloody violence.

A place where the world does not end with a bang as much as it dries out with a whimper, all love and emotion wizened and worn out by weather until nothing is left but the desert. And it’s a desert.

A Sex Worker Talks to a John,"The money changing hands is a way of saying, “This money symbolizes our agreement that this is temporary, a fantasy, it’s just pretend, and at the end of the hour we go our separate ways. Now c’mere and let’s pretend!”

There’s a saying, which I think is kind of crass-sounding, that “You aren’t paying for the sex, you’re paying for her to go away afterwards.” But it’s true in a way, and the agreement goes both ways. By paying, you are agreeing that the hour is all you get, is all you are entitled to. In some ways, this is preferable to one-nighters and hookups and short-term affairs, when even if there is agreement to not get attached, inevitably somebody might anyways, and then there may be resentments and long-lasting emotional consequences to deal with",https://medium.com/the-billfold/a-sex-worker-talks-to-a-john-96ad98817171,['Logan Sachon'],2015-12-08 21:22:05.487000+00:00,"['Sex Work', 'Antonia Crane', 'Jobs']"
#WhatIWantedToWear: The Skin I’m In,"RuPaul once said “we all come into the world naked and the rest is drag.” In thinking about what I wanted to wear, I found that what resonated most deeply wasn’t how I dressed my body up in drag, but how I felt about my body itself. As a survivor of body terrorism, I often think about whose bodies are devalued, criminalized and ultimately destroyed.

While I have learned to celebrate my body, the journey to radical self love wasn’t easy. In fact for the majority of my life I internalized the shame of being too fat, too black and too intersex for mainstream America. Everyday in ways big and small I was told that my body didn’t belong in their bathrooms, on their airplanes and especially not on their runways. However since relocating to NYC earlier this summer I’ve become one of the first plus size trans models of color.

I believe that when we show up whole and authentically we allow others to do the same. That’s why I’ve decided to unapologetically display my dark skin, my stretch marks and all my lovely lady lumps. This nude self portrait has become one of my favorite pictures because it signifies the moment when I learned to love my body in all of it’s melanated glory.

Interlude,"I woke up to blackness. That was pretty common. My room had six windows exact. I could barely see the moon, save for when I pointed at it. I let my head leave the pillow for a minute as my eyes adjusted. There was a tiny monkey in my room, fast asleep. He looked so peaceful resting there, breathing in, breathing out. I heard a whisper come from what seemed to be outside my room: “Monkey. Monkey.” Did I just say that or was it coming from outside? No, it was outside, I’m sure of it. I heard the voice again call the monkey. I sat up in bed and pulled the covers a bit closer to my chest. My throat was tightening. Still the voice kept calling the monkey. At first the sounds seemed to come from nowhere in particular, then they were distinctly traveling through each of my six windows. The voice was consistent. So was the monkey, at every call he fidgeted and adjusted his sleeping position, but then continued to snooze. I started to feel anxious as the voice got louder. “Monkey! Monkey!” It was so loud I’m sure the moon could hear it. Through one window, through the next.

Why Marissa Mayer is too hot to be Yahoo’s CEO: The case against hiring women.,"Marissa Mayer, Yahoo! president and CEO, on the August 2013 cover of Vogue.

“We could never hire her because she was too hot. Even if she was qualified, we would never hire her. Men would’ve fought over who got to sleep with her. It would be too distracting. And it might even be dangerous for her. She would’ve been harassed. And I can’t fire my entire workforce for harassing her, because then who would do the work?”

Last night I spoke with a man who believes denying qualified women roles at his Chicago trading firm is not only not sexist (“it’s realist,” he says), but is actually good for business (see above quote from said man).

“I’m not a sexist, I’m a realist,” this man (a father of two girls) repeated, justifying the systematic denial of opportunities to women in the workplace. He lauded himself for this hiring practice, as if perpetuating sexist ideals and realities — and admitting to it — is the moral high ground.

Of the over 150 employees who publicly identify themselves as working for this firm on LinkedIn, only 18 are women. That’s an 11% female workforce.

Good for business?

Not exactly.

David Futrelle explains in a February 2013 article for TIME:

“Economists see discrimination as a form of economic inefficiency — a massive, systematic misallocation of human resources. Those in the discriminated-against groups can’t bring their full talents to the table, languishing in jobs that are in many ways ‘beneath them,’ while less-talented members of more privileged groups take high-powered, high-paying jobs that are beyond their abilities, dragging down everyone with their relative incompetence.

Economists describe this, drily, in terms of ‘human capital frictions’ that impose ‘a group-specific tax for each occupation on the inputs into human capital production,’ as one recent paper puts it.

…progress against discrimination — and towards a not only fairer but also more efficient economy — has paid off in a big way. As Hsieh and his colleagues figure it, ‘[c]hanges in occupational barriers facing blacks and women can explain 15 to 20 percent of aggregate wage growth between 1960 and 2008.’ Most of this change, they say, has been ‘driven by the movement of women into high-skilled occupations.’”

When I asked how this trader’s discriminatory hiring philosophy is any different from not hiring a black person to appease racist employees (or, in his language, to protect said black person from the inevitable harassment he or she would experience), I was told it is “entirely different.”

“Racism is unacceptable,” he said.

Racism is unacceptable, and institutional sexism is strong business acumen.

Being a feminist in 2015 is hard. Not because people think I’m going to set off the fire alarm with my burning bra. And not because there’s a widespread irrational fear of the “F” word. But because it’s socially acceptable to endlessly justify sexism —prejudice or discrimination based on sex, especially discrimination against women — as realism.

It’s this kind of flawed logic that prevents women from breaking into male-dominated fields. Women comprised only 17.6% of executive officers in the finance and insurance industries in 2013, according to the 2013 Catalyst Census: Fortune 500 Women Executive Officers and Top Earners, which counts the number of women in upper management in Fortune 500 companies.

It’s this kind of flawed logic that not only boxes women out of male-dominated fields, but also perpetuates the inherent less-than, other-ness, and lack of value women are perceived to have.

In the trader’s mind, a male employee’s right to harass a qualified female employee outweighs her right to get the job she deserves.

(Remember, he can’t fire his entire workforce for harassing her, because then who would be left to do all the work?)

This man is the embodiment of why workplace diversity is so important. He’s not only self-assured, he’s externally validated by the 89% of male coworkers he’s surrounded by. How is he supposed to know he’s wrong when everyone around him says he’s right? Sameness and discrimination breed sameness and discrimination.

I left the conversation feeling furious and defeated. There’s only so much you can say to someone who earnestly believes they’re doing a service to “hot” women by not hiring them, saving them from the throes of the male-dominated workplace. I kept thinking, “Is Marissa Mayer too hot to be the CEO of Yahoo?”

Of course she’s not. It’s a ridiculous argument backed by patriarchal ideals that’s perpetuated by men, particularly in male-dominated fields.

In my parting words last night, I advised the trader to educate himself on the topic before he so explicitly defends his discriminatory workplace practices to strangers (discrimination in the workplace is, after all, illegal. The company’s hiring page states it is an “equal opportunity/affirmative action employer and does not discriminate with regard to age, race, creed, color, religion, sex, disability, pregnancy, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, ancestry, national or ethnic origin, citizenship status, military status or status as a disabled veteran or veteran of the Vietnam era, or any legally recognized status entitled to protection under applicable federal, state, or local anti-discrimination laws.”)

My expectation of equality for men and women doesn’t make me an idealist, just as this man’s promotion of inequality in the workplace doesn’t make him a realist.

So here I am, writing on the Internet about one man’s decision not to hire a woman because she is a woman. A “hot” one, at that.

It’s sexist. It’s discriminatory. It’s wrong. And I’m not afraid to say it.",https://medium.com/endless/why-marissa-mayer-is-too-hot-be-yahoo-s-ceo-the-case-against-hiring-women-6202dfed82d0,['Alex Kane'],2015-11-20 15:40:20.191000+00:00,"['Women', 'Feminism', 'Diversity']"
"“You Here for the Oculus Gang Bang, Too?”","It’s a strap-on, that headset. No two ways around it. A blindfold, too. With headphones, if you really want to do this right. Now, throw in some kind of artificial orifice, like a Fleshlight, or some other newfangled creation in the burgeoning field of teledildonics, and ask yourself: How does it feel? Amazing? The porn industry imagines that it does, just as it imagines you, deaf and blind and draped in technology, are excited, even turned on.

That’s the hope, anyway, when Brian Shuster, the CEO of Utherverse, delivers his “visionary keynote” to XBiz 360, a conference that bills itself as “the online adult industry’s top trade event.” We are in the Andaz West Hollywood, on the Sunset Strip, when Shuster says he believes virtual reality is the inevitable future of pornography. This is not a surprise. Porn is an industry not unlike any other in media, in that free content has eroded the business model from within. Utherverse creates online 3-D virtual worlds where a user’s avatar can meet and have sex with other users, or pliant bots, in a variety of sexy, rendered venues. An X-rated Second Life, basically. The most popular of Shuster’s domains is redlightcenter.com. He has been pouring money into making his virtual kingdoms ready for the second coming, which is VR. Tomorrow he and his team will be hosting a small virtual demo of one such world on the Oculus Rift.

So, VR it is, or will be, or might be. Who knows!? It’s the future, anyway. I was eager to see what Shuster’s futuresex visions looked like, just as I was surprised he was actually going to show the demo. I had spent the past four months listening to people tell me how exciting it would be, to exist in this fantasy world of virtual sex with anyone or anything imaginable. And yet trying to glimpse some form of this VR porn had led me to a distant edge of Los Angeles County with a distinct sense that I was unwanted and had, perhaps, fallen for an elaborate form of X-rated hucksterism.

My search for the future started quite hopefully, with a company called SugarDVD, which is like Netflix, but for porn. The company announced it was working on a “choose your own adventure”-like first-person virtual experience for the Oculus Rift. A spokesperson for SugarDVD named Rebecca Bolen wrote on the company’s website that they had a demo and were looking for volunteers. When I called her, Bolen told me the company’s engineers were not simply working on an erotic experience unlike any the world had seen, but were talking about what to build off it that would change the very way people thought about sex. “We’ve been doing social media longer than anyone,” Bolen said. “When you think about it, what’s more social than sex?” I said I wasn’t sure. Before she hung up, she told me how she’d be talking to the team, the CEO and developers, and would set up a time for me to come in and chat, see what they were up to, maybe sit in on one of those meetings where they discussed and planned out the future.

Weeks passed, then a month, then Bolen’s emails began bouncing back, then she appeared again, but only to set up a meeting, then push it back, then cancel it. Eventually I determined that the best course of action was to just show up at the SugarDVD headquarters.

SugarDVD is one of a suite of companies owned by Oddesse, which has its offices in Chatsworth, in the northwestern-most corner of the San Fernando Valley, where the suburban development peters out at the foothills of the Santa Susanas, crude hills pockmarked with sandstone boulders and rattlers, probably. The office itself was a low-slung cinderblock structure, unmarked and unremarkable. I pressed the buzzer and waited. A man in a Mickey Mouse T-shirt opened the door. I said I was here to see Rebecca Bolen. “Do you have a meeting?” he asked. “Kind of,” I said. Then added, “Just tell her Ryan Bradley is here to see her.” But when he went to close the door, I made a move, wanting to wait inside. It was hot out, and relentlessly bright. “No,” he said, “You need to wait here.”

A minute passed and then suddenly I saw a woman rush down the stairs and, in what seemed like one fluid motion, move from the last step to opening the door. “Ryan?” she said. “Rebecca?” I said. “Oh, I don’t think any of our engineers are available to talk to you right now!” she said. She was extremely pale and had very red hair and a matching red leather jacket. She let me in.

We talked for an hour in a large break room. There was very little about the décor to suggest this was the headquarters of a vast adult entertainment empire. Behind me, on the bookshelf, I noted Jack Welch’s Jack, a Murdoch biography, and Stori Telling by Tori Spelling. Bolen apologized for the disappearing act. They had been very busy updating their streaming service app, she told me, so that it could tailor content even more specifically to users’ desires. “So that, if you hate big butts and you cannot lie, you will literally never see a big butt in any of the videos. Sometimes it will even be pixelated out.” She repeated a line she had told me before, when we were talking on the phone, about how SugarDVD was more of a tech company than a porn company. This seemed very important to her. At one point a little robot on wheels careened into the room, pivoted, and shined a green light at us. “Oh, that’s our droid,” she said. The droid backed out of the room and, in the hallway, proceeded to do a series of spectacularly high hops as Bolen continued talking.

Eventually we started talking about the company’s progress in VR, which was…not far? It was slow going. They had just scanned one of “the girls,” a star named Alex Chance, and were going to scan a few more. The scanning process was as simple as getting the star to stand in the middle of a room while cameras moved around her, then stitching the images together, on a computer, and replicating her body virtually. As for the demo itself, they were “exploring options” like changing a star’s hair color, but what sort of “action” would be available was still a mystery.

At the end of our meeting Bolen took me in to see SugarDVD’s CEO, Jax. Jax Smith. A pretty good porn name. Stocky fellow with something between a close-cropped beard and extravagant stubble, loose fitting black deep-cut V-neck T-shirt, big biceps. We said very little to each other but shook hands long enough for him to squeeze just a little too hard and stare just a little too long, imparting to me that he knew what I was doing, and that I wasn’t invited. I squeezed his hand back and tried without words to say something like “Yes, I am not supposed to be here, we are not supposed to be having this uncomfortable moment together, you and I. Nonetheless I am learning all kinds of interesting things about your technology company.” Then I smiled wide and told him this all seemed really exciting and I couldn’t wait to set up a time for us to have a longer chat. “Sure, sure,” he said. Then Bolen led me out, and I was never invited back.

(Months and months later, Bolen told Matter that SugarDVD’s virtual sex demo was canned, that the company is “pursuing the options” but that “the technology was moving very quickly and we had to put the project on hold until we could gather more resources to pursue VR options.”)

The Andaz West Hollywood — host to Xbiz 360 — was once, not so long ago, the Continental Hyatt House, also known as the Riot House, a place made famous by the rock stars who stayed there and trashed it (Zeppelin, the Stones, Bowie — though Bowie didn’t, apparently, toss his rooms quite so aggressively). “Today,” a placard inside the Andaz reads, “the hotel appears on almost every reality show on TV.” The Andaz’s Panorama Penthouse is filled with men, mostly middle-aged, mostly in advanced stages of hair loss, who appear to have never considered nor touched the top three buttons of their shirts. All are wearing a white lanyard with the words “exoClick” printed on either side, repeatedly. Attached to the lanyard is a badge with the attendee’s name and the company he works for. Every other square inch is filled with advertising — for adultfriendfinder.com, cams.com, alt.com, penthouse.com, and Out Personals. The walls of the Andaz are covered with ads, too. As are the elevator doors (both sides), floors (carpeted and otherwise), and hallways (which are lined with banners that both rise from the floor and come draped from the ceiling). The penthouse conference room has advertisements behind the stage and to either side. “They really sold the shit out of this place, didn’t they?” one speaker announced, with wonder. More than once, I overhear attendees remark that the space has been transformed into something like the physical manifestation of a porn site.

Many floors below the Panorama Penthouse, where the men who control online porn discuss the buying and selling of traffic, porn stars are considering how best to promote their personal brands in this modern age. The panel is moderated by the most famous male porn star since Ron Jeremy: James Deen. Perhaps you’ve heard of him? Or seen him costarring in the film The Canyons, with Lindsay Lohan?

Deen is seated in the audience, facing the four panelists, peppering them with questions. As a moderator he is relentless and sometimes brutal. After asking a young and fairly new star, Chanel Preston, what she would like to see in the future and getting the reply, “Some good sex. I don’t know. What was the question?” he stands up, walks over, and unplugs her clip-on microphone. Near the end, after Preston has plugged her mic back in but things have broken down into more of a discussion among the panelists, Deen begins wandering back and forth, in front of the low stage. Occasionally he takes a sip of water, or barks a laugh, or interjects a clarifying question. He does this when the four panelists are trying to make sense of their work, specifically, all the weird off-camera, fan-outreach stuff they have to do, which isn’t glamorous and too often, they say, goes unnoticed. “What about the fact that there aren’t superstars anymore?” Deen asks, then adds: “Lisa?”

Lisa Ann, the grand dame among the panelists, star of the mega-hit Hustler joint Who’s Nailin Paylin? answers, “There are no more stars because everyone has become obtainable.” What she means is that there is no mystery anymore. And something more base, still. She continues: “No one is up on a pedestal. Now everyone has side work” — a nice way of saying that they can be bought and slept with. “They don’t dress well. It’s disgusting. You can’t hire me at home. I’ve never had intimate engagements with a fan. I don’t want to be watered down.”

A prolonged and uncomfortable silence follows because, well, Lisa Ann maybe wasn’t supposed to tell it quite so much like it is. The truth — that more porn stars are prostituting themselves, that the wall between the fans and stars has crumbled to a dangerously imperceptible level, that with the rise of live-cam sites the work is often a disagreeable blend of fantasy and reality, and that with virtual reality that blending is only going to get trickier, with porn stars more obtainable, more watered down than ever — is ugly and bleak. Deen steers the panel into safer waters: “What is your favorite thing about performing in this day and age?” he asks the quartet. Lisa Ann doesn’t blink. “Big paychecks,” she says.

Wrapping things up, Deen turns to the audience and says, “Do not accost any of the performers on their way out.” He puts his microphone down, moves to the side of the room, and tries — and fails — to escape. “I have this sandwich I need to eat,” I hear him say, softly, once he is cornered by a conference organizer.

A man in the back, reflecting on all that we have just witnessed, says, “That was hot,” to no one in particular.

Before virtual reality there was Buttman. Buttman was the 1989 creation of an adult-film director named John Stagliano, who wandered through his Chatsworth home, video camera in hand, filming his various friends in various states of intercourse and undress. He also changed the face of porn, and virtual reality porn, forever. Stagliano called his plotless ramble The Adventures of Buttman, and it birthed a movement called gonzo pornography. Virtual porn today isn’t all that much different from Buttman’s first-person point-of-view exploits. The cameras are smaller, the images sharper and, more and more often, in 3-D. But Buttman’s first-person element remains. Along with, of course, all the random sex.

But watching a porn star do his thing (and it is, still, nearly always, the guy holding or wearing the camera) isn’t especially new, even the versions that are available on the Rift — i.e., video shot with 360-degree cameras so you can kind of look around (as if you were a person fixed to a point atop a porn dude’s head). No, to get a real peep at the future one must seek out fully built worlds. You need agency. You need to feel like you are the one having the experience, and not getting to exist as a camera atop another dude.

One avenue that has always granted users agency is video games, and sure enough, one of the most anticipated is called Wicked Paradise by a company called Immersive. Wicked Paradise was to be “like a mature TV series with a rich storyline and characters like Game of Thrones and with a lot of passion and excitement like Californication, but without censorship,” the game’s creator, Jeroen Van Der Bosch, told reporters last year. But when I tried to reach Van Der Bosch, and got instead Immersive’s then-CEO, Barr Potter, he assured me the company was “not going to focus on sex as the purpose of our content.” Also: Immersive was no longer working on Wicked Paradise. He said they wanted to be in the “mainstream entertainment business.”

You could also give viewers agency by surrounding them with renderings based on body scans, like the kind SugarDVD was working on. These existed and were of extremely high quality. Two British companies, Veivie and Infinite Realities, made them. One afternoon I met up with a friend of a friend who had a Rift and was willing to download these demos (which the companies make available online for free). The demos were deeply strange to the point of being disturbing. The renderings were static. And, while more realistic than anything I’d yet encountered, they felt more like a museum exhibit than like anything remotely sexually stirring.

Corey Strassburger, a co-founder at Kite & Lightning, the hottest and mind-blowingest of all the new VR firms in L.A. told me he understood my disappointment but that I needed to also understand just how difficult this three dimensional in motion image capture business really was. He, too, had seen some of the “frozen moment” demos. “It was cool, but too lifeless,” he said. “Good 3-D capture is only kind of possible now in even the best of circumstances — in blockbuster movies with huge budgets and viewers that don’t move and ruin the effect — and even then, it’s just so expensive and time consuming, it’s like we can barely do it. The ‘uncanny valley’ is just a really tough nut to crack.” Even then, if you had the ability to walk around, and you wanted to see something from the side, an awful lot of this human rendering business would fall apart. It’d look like the cheap trick of the eyes it really was.

The day after Deen’s panel at the XBIZ conference, Brian Shuster of Utherverse and redlightcenter.com has his Oculus Rift demo. Utherverse isn’t creating the most technically complex virtual realms (that’d be Kite & Lightning) but the worlds of redlightcenter.com are most representative of what everyone seems to hope VR porn will one day be. It’s a world you can move through. A world with a lot of gyrating, naked women.

The demo room is quite small, not even big enough for a real-life banner ad. It is terribly drab and monotone save for one man, Cash Garman, a reedy fellow whose hair has been sculpted into four fuchsia spikes approximately two feet tall apiece, whose pants are plaid and green, and whose sleeveless black shirt reads “Hack Planet.” Garmen is a client programmer for Utherverse. He’s here to set up whatever it is we are about to experience. I sit down and wait. The room begins to fill — it can’t seat more than 15. Someone walks in and asks, “you here for the Oculus gang bang, too?” and gets a few chuckles. Mostly, though, everyone is expectantly silent.

We are eventually asked to wait outside. Staring out at the sidewalk on Sunset, I think about a story I’d heard or read somewhere from the old Riot House, about Led Zeppelin’s band members tossing televisions off their balconies, and wonder how the smashed glass of the busted sets must’ve looked under the neon light, and did anyone get hurt? Later, I look up and find but cannot confirm a rumor that one television landed in the backseat of a car a kid had borrowed from his dad, a canary yellow Eldorado.

A woman with a clipboard calls me in. Garmen, finished with his setup, is leaning back in his chair at the front of the room and has got this great punker smirk-slash-sneer going. Beside him is a table with a laptop, headphones, and Rift. In front of that is a seat, for the participant. Behind the table, facing the seat, is a full-length mirror. Kind of nice touch, I think, to see yourself as you slip on the headset and enter virtual sexytime, or whatever.

The woman with the clipboard tells us we will be experiencing two scenes, about a minute each, one a strip club, one a sex party. The graphics, Garmen says, are a combination of motion capture and pure CGI, all rendered in the Unity gaming engine. They’ve already begun rolling out content that’s Oculus-optimized on redlightcenter.com, and should have about six months’ worth up soon. For this demo, they’ve “eliminated the joystick element” because it brings on nausea. So, no, you won’t be able to move. Can you have sex? No. But you can watch, which I do.

First, I watch the folks who are before me on the sign-up sheet. Each one sits down, while the woman with the clipboard helps him (or her; there are a few women in the small room, too) attach the black box to his face and slip big earphones on his ears. He sits still for a moment, then turns, far to the left, then to the right, then down a bit, up a bit, back to the left, straight ahead. By this time, maybe a minute in, many of the participants’ mouths are slightly agape. A few grin a little.

When it’s my turn, and I slip on the strap-on headset and wait a moment for my eyes to adjust, for the image to clarify, while the headphones are placed over my ears and a persistent bass begins to thump. I am in a strip club or, rather, someone’s idea of a strip club. More likely still: many people’s collective creation that is supposed to be a strip club. It is quite empty, and the lighting is weirdly harsh and delineated. A topless woman gyrates in front of me, but here is where writing about virtual worlds aid the lie. The words “topless woman” will immediately conjure in your mind a real image of a topless woman, just as the words strip club recalls a real space. Neither is true. Nothing looks remotely real. The sounds are real-ish — too loud but not loud enough to drown out muffled voices behind me, reminding me of the room I am sitting in with a black box strapped to my face while I look at digitally manufactured breasts bob atypically. I grin, and while grinning wonder if the others who I saw grinning before me were grinning about the same thought I’m having right now, which is: We are so damn silly, we humans, men in particular.

The strip club fades out and the other scene, the sex party, begins. I am on some large and vaguely Japanese-looking outdoor deck, or in a hallway. I’m not quite sure about the space because roughly human renderings of supine creatures to either side of me are fucking loudly. The depictions of the men’s penises are geometric and strange, almost tribal, and I catch myself staring at one of them. It reminds me of phalluses I’ve seen in the Oceania wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, particularly those carved into wood and used as gongs, or spears, or prows of long canoes by the hill tribes in Papua New Guinea.

Then a gentle tug, and the headset is off, and the time is up. I glance in the mirror and look at myself for just a moment, trying to read my expression, walk a few paces to the back of the tiny conference room, and sit back down and wait awhile longer, watching more people strap on, smile, and look to the left and the right at the sex renderings.

A sex surrogate named Eric B. once told me about a kind of sex that is maybe the opposite of everything in that tiny conference room — despite the fact that some people have suggested that VR could maybe help people in the exact way sexual surrogacy does, drawing them out, helping the wheelchair-bound feel more comfortable and connected. When describing his work, Eric B. stressed how long it often took to get to the sex itself, and how much of what he did was simply getting people to quiet their minds, which began with focusing on something as simple as touching, and being touched. “We take turns. I would hold your hand, and stroke it for a minute. Just one minute. And then the client, you would stroke my hand for a minute. The idea is to bring ourselves into that moment, to focus on the sensations of what’s going on in that hand, how does it feel to give, and receive, and stay present in the sensations,” he told me. “We go back and forth. We talk about ‘Wow, how was that?’” The key, he said, beyond staying present, not falling back into your mind, is to “only do things that feel good to me. We don’t think, Are we doing it the right way? Am I holding my hand the right way?”

The man at the front of the room with the black box strapped onto his face is sitting stock-still. He has been for a minute now. I wonder what he’s thinking, if he’s thinking about whether or not he’s doing this right, or if he’s given up, or if he’s considering just how difficult it is to escape from ourselves, the persistent present tense of our existence, that it’s impossible, really, and that simply dealing with ourselves and maybe someone else is plenty. “I’d say teaching people to open up and trust another person is the literal opposite of porn, virtual and otherwise,” Eric B. had told me. Sometimes his clients would be coming to him for years. Sometimes it took that long to learn to be touched.

The man at the front stands up now, his session over, and heads to the back of the room, where a colleague or friend has been waiting. “So? Next big thing?” his colleague/friend asks. The man hunches his shoulders up and let’s out a long, large sigh that turns into an “eeeehhhhhhhhhhhh.” As they leave the room together the door swings open and, from somewhere out in the hall, out past the window and the city and the atmosphere, a single patch of sunlight falls into the room, only briefly, then the door closes and it’s gone.

The web’s diversity expressed in a global map of animal memes

“A Global Perspective” on animal memes. The Civic Beat’s ongoing contribution to “How Cats Took Over the Internet” at the Museum of the Moving Image, curated by Jason Eppink. Photo by Negar Mottahedeh.

It’s been exciting days here for The Civic Beat: Jason Eppink’s terrific show, “How Cats Took Over the Internet,” opened at the Museum of the Moving Image. And as far as we can tell from the reviews so far, it’s been a hit. Here’s what The New York Times’s Jennifer A. Kingson had to say:

The exhibition — which may well be the first mainstream museum installation entirely dedicated to cats online — is made up mostly of images, videos and GIFs of cats and is meant to be a cultural deconstruction of their enduring popularity. The show takes a high-minded look at anthropomorphism and what it calls the “aesthetics of cuteness” as well as a low-brow wallow through cheesy trends — like the LOLcats who demand cheezburger — and bad puns, like Caturday, a fad that had people posting cat pictures on Saturdays.

One of the surprises of the show, as revealed in the review (I hope this isn’t a spoiler!) is that cats haven’t necessarily taken over the internet statistically — Jason found that cats and dogs tend to be shared in equal amounts. But as Carl Goodman, the Museum’s executive director noted, they are culturally significant, and that’s why the cats-on-the-internet phenomenon is worth thinking about critically in a museum.

And they’re also culturally situated. We’re excited and honored to have a global map of animal memes included in this show. The map reflects the hard work, ideation and research done by our map advisory team, which includes Jason Li, Ben Valentine, Ruth Miller and Matt Stempeck, and the many contributing researchers.

It’s been heartening to see reviews by writers at places like Vogue and Wired s who generally understand the themes we’re trying to communicate with the map and the research behind it — and that’s one of cultural specificity, which matters when we talk about the global web. The map hopes to show that he animals we find funny and cute and interesting to share on the web are culturally situated.

Sometimes it’s cats, sometimes it’s llamas, sometimes it’s goats; what we share online often reflects the conversations we have offline, and the relationships we foster with animals. And sometimes it’s no animals at all. Indeed, while memetic practice seems to be common in many corners of the web, the very act of sharing animal pictures on the web can itself be culturally situated. As we bring in more research from folks in different parts of the world, we hope to see more nuances and trends emerge. (The Museum has agreed to let the map grow over the course of the museum exhibition, which is great).

As one example, our map includes Negar Mottahedeh’s research from Iran, which suggests that animal memes are far from universal: the green chick is a cute animal, but animal memes make rare appearances in Iran’s web. Instead, Mottahedeh’s found that the color green has become a meme expressed in internet avatars and representing the opposition.

The more important meme in the above is the phrase that the chick is saying:

Three days after the election, a militia fired into a crowd of protesters, killing at least thirteen and injuring many more. The crowd raised the bodies of those murdered and broke into a chant: “Mikosham, Mikosham anke baradaram kosht ” (I will kill, I will kill, he who killed my brother). The recollection of this chant, which originated at an Iranian Revolution protest three decades earlier, sharply condemned the state’s betrayal of the Islamic Republic’s founding ethics of solidarity and radical kinship and its resolute stance against injustice.

Cultural specificity matters when we talk about the global web. The fun and silliness of animal memes reveals a deeper point: just as different localities on the internet express cuteness/funniness about animals in very different ways, so too can internet cultures — and offline cultures —be very different from each other in many ways.

Misunderstandings, often rooted on shaky conceptions of foreign contexts, occur far too often in global reportage. Take, for instance, a few recent examples: #SomeoneTellCNN in Kenya — no, Kenya is not a hotbed of terror — , and the Taylor Swift non-controversy in China — no, the Chinese government isn’t freaking out about Taylor’s new album title. Stories like these happen frequently, especially when writing about global contexts.

And so, part of our hope with the map is to broaden the conversation. Talking about animal memes and just how different they are in different parts of the world is, I hope, a vehicle to saying, “Not every part of the world fits neat Western narratives about how things operate.”

The internet is super diverse — and interconnected in really surprising ways.

So many movements and so many people around the world are sharing cute, funny animals. But due to cultural, linguistic and technological barriers, these actions are largely invisible to each other: the ola k ase llama in Mexico (see video at the bottom of this post) probably hasn’t met the grass mud horse llama in China (see video just below this paragraph). The goats of the UK don’t seem to intermingle with the goats in Uganda. But by placing them on the same map, maybe we can spark more curiosity about how different corners of the web express themselves.

And when we talk about the “next billion” coming online, it’s important to understand just how diverse that next billion will be. They won’t necessarily be sharing cat videos, or any animal videos. As Wired writer Margaret Rhodes notes in her review, “As the demographics of the Internet change, so will its memes and fetishes.”

Arguably, that’s already happening, but there are still billions more people who do not participate fully in broadband, always-on internet (which doesn’t mean they’re not connected ; I’ve written recently about what connectivity looks like in other parts of the world).

We hope our map offers a small taste of that, and we’re thrilled to be a part of the larger exhibition.

More from us soon, including an open call for researchers to share their thoughts and perspectives on animal meme culture (or the lack thereof) in other parts of the world. There are many geographies not yet covered that we hope to include in the coming months, and we’re already in touch with a number of folks preparing their entries to this ongoing project.

For now, we have to thank Andrés Monroy-Hernandes (Mexico), Kate Miltner (United Kingdom), Peter Kakoma (Uganda), Mark Kaigwa and his fellow researchers Ramadhan “Ramzzy” Oluoch and Dennis Bett (Kenya), Negar Mottahedeh (Iran), Irteze Ubaid (Pakistan), Matt Stempeck (Russia) and Alex Leavitt (Japan), as well as our editor Dorothy Santos.

Mega Christianity,"How to reconcile Christ teachings with the reality of mega churches today

The Hartford Institute For Religion Research defines a megachurch as a Protestant congregation with sustained weekly attendance above 2,000. The Institute’s database identifies nearly 1,600 megachurches [in the U.S.]. Roughly 40% of megachurches are nondenominational. Megachurches are not places where people merely go for a couple of hours every Sunday for worship. They are seven day a week institutions with many activities going on. [Source: http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterjreilly/2013/04/10/megachurch-denied-property-tax-exemption-for-gym-and-bookstorecafe/]

What do the mega churches have in common?

Generalizing, they use the so-called prosperity gospel, also know as ""the Word of Faith"" to attract the audience. Preaching the prosperity gospel, mega pastors make followers believe material blessing is the will of God for Christians, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to Christian ministries will increase one’s financial wealth.

Prosperity theology has been criticized by leaders in the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements, as well as traditional protestant denominations. These leaders maintain that it is irresponsible, promotes idolatry, and is contrary to scripture. Some critics have proposed that prosperity theology cultivates authoritarian organizations, with the leaders controlling the lives of the adherents. Academics have attributed some of its success to its parallels with the traditional shamanistic culture. Prosperity theology has drawn followers from the American middle class and poor.

How to reconcile Prosperity Gospel with Christ teachings?

Let's watch a video that caused a lot of discussion everywhere in the news last week:

Observations:

Prosperity gospel teaches followers to use God to achieve financial gain, whereas the truth of biblical christianity is just the opposite: God uses the believer.

Emphasis of giving is built on motives that are anything but philanthropic

What the Good Samaritan story teach us (Luke 10:35)? — Give, hoping for nothing in return

What does the Bible say:

Jesus teachings

John 10:7–11 (Abundant Life) 7 Therefore Jesus said again, “Very truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. 8 All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them. 9 I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved.[a] They will come in and go out, and find pasture. 10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full. 11 “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 12 The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. 13 The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. Matthew 6:19–34 Treasures in Heaven

19 “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. 22 “The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy,[c] your whole body will be full of light. 23 But if your eyes are unhealthy,[d] your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness! 24 “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. Do Not Worry

25 “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life[e]? 28 “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you — you of little faith? 31 So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. Matthew 19:23–28 23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. 24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” 25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?” 26 Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” 27 Peter answered him, “We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?” 28 Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife[e] or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. 30 But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.

Other teachings

Galatians 3:14 14 He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit. James 4:1–7 Submit Yourselves to God

4 What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from your desires that battle within you? 2 You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God. 3 When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures. 4 You adulterous people,[a] don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. 5 Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us[b]? 6 But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.”[c] 7 Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 2 Corinthians 8:8–15 8 I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others. 9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich. 10 And here is my judgment about what is best for you in this matter. Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so. 11 Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means. 12 For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have. 13 Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality. 14 At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality, 15 as it is written: “The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.”[b] Psalm 37:25

25 I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread.

26 They are always generous and lend freely; their children will be a blessing.[b]

Art Basel: Unsanitized,"With this newly revitalized approach to weirdness in mind, House of Gunt covered the gallery floor in the remains of my styrofoam head and tutti-frutti sucker meal, Influenza Mueller’s cut strands of hair, Anita Shavé’s slivers of broken mirror, and TToyota Mitsubishi’s customized picnic luncheon plates. Dino Real delivered unabashed opulence like an orgasm you can’t afford. Local Honey and SSTR collaborated for some sort of backwards self-seance with a recipe of thick tears streaming from Local’s eyes into a kettle of boiling water with the alienating sound of SSTR’s voice. Sophia Park brought whip-its to highten our craving for Limited Too and pastel-themed bedroom parties, followed by Ellen Degenerate’s fanny pack in full swing on the dance floor.

Kalan did a puppet show in the street outside the gallery while I rolled on the floor to the swing of a Percocet administered to me by a rando while we were wrestling on the sidewalk over a silver spoon. James half told me, half spoke to the room about how his life had changed over the past few months. I imagined what it would be like to hear his story had I really known who he was. He sat in a black folding chair against one wall of the gallery smoking a rolled cigarette and told me about how he got diabetes and how he couldn’t easily get access to insulin since he wasn’t from Florida. I wondered what it was like to suddenly find out you have to measure some part of your biology like a hawk and consistently maintain access to proper medical care and briefly imagined the smell of his hair on my pillow the night after he slept in my bed. He didn’t have to say much.

“REVOLUTION IS PISS” bled a piece of canvas framed on the wall.

We smoked one more cigarette and James left to go to sleep.

I woke up the next morning naked on a piece of foam. Kalan told me I was beautiful. I told them they wouldn’t think that forever. Part of me hates myself for trying to be honest.

In several terrifying moments I felt like I’d only met someone like Kalan in fragments of other people. It was magnetic to the point of nausea.

Hungover, Kalan and I walked to some of the stores surrounding Space Mountain on the hunt for food. Across the street from the galleries in a line were abandoned storefronts painted light blue. I’d heard Liz say the night before that the neighboorhood was being bought up and it’d all be gone and sold soon. It reminded me of the outskirts of Savannah’s downtown where rows of empty buildings line streets that have yet to be discovered by developers or turned into cheap housing or Kate Spade stores. Soon it’ll all be equally as overrun by tourist-rich glitz like the kind in Miami creeping into Little Haiti with money from downtown. In a rainbow mumu and face paint from the night before, I carried Kalan on my back to Mimi’s fruit stand for apples and bananas.

I couldn’t tell if they made Mimi so animated or if it was always in her nature to seem so genuinely inquisitive. “Did you two come from a circus?” she laughed as she rolled giant potted palm trees out onto the painted storefront. I bit into an apple and contemplated where Mimi’s fruit and my bare ass blowing in the wind underneath my mumu would fit into the liposuctioned experience of #ABMB2014.

As an idea, the lie of Art Basel, along with my vision of Miami interpreted through hot movie scenes in South Beach, seemed to exist far from the 8000 block of NE 2nd outside of Mimi’s— it lives far behind fake velvet ropes and purse checks and hashtags and location services to tag the whitewashed walls filled with sterilized, whiteified, expensified, sexified, pieces of buy-able, solidifiable, explainable, tangible “ART.”

That idea was reinforced the next day after crashing a model’s photoshoot on the 11th street beach outside of the UNTITLED tent, taking a photo of internet socialite Nicky Ottav walking down the beach dressed like Spongebob, and spilling two Wet Willies daquiris on Dino Real’s feet while contemplating what to do with our night. Local, Eyal, Blew, and Dino promised to meet up with us at some party a mutual photographer friend had mentioned in an attempt to continue our hack into Art Basel.

In the meantime, I got a text that Kalan had been arrested with the art cart on Lincoln Street. I bit the inside of my lip for not being able to separate myself from my group to be there—what my presence would do about it, I have no idea—but it is the same feeling I got knowing Ferguson protestors were filling I-95 and I was drunk, peeing into a bathroom decorated like a tropical island.

Six memos for 2015,"Here are six ideas that I think we’ll see and hear a lot about in 2015. Some of them are already creeping up the buzzword charts but before they get totally ‘rinsed’ here’s a few thoughts about them.

Resilience

I think this one is going to be a biggie, least of all because I can’t stop using it. For me, last year was the year of ‘responsive’ design, you couldn’t move for discussion and comment on it. I’m as guilty as the next man for this. But this year I feel that the discussion will shift, it will move from the methodologies back to the core needs. One of the main things that responsive design gives us is more resilience. Designs no longer brake so readily, for so many people — they responsively change, becoming more flexible and accommodating — becoming more resilient across a wider range of contexts and situations. The idea of resilience is already being widely discussed in both public sector and corporate strategy, reflecting a larger shift in thinking from rigid structures to dynamic, smart systems. We all want resilience, as we don’t want things to fail and crumble away. We don’t want to have to continuously tear it down and start again. We want to weather the storms and ride through rough and unexpected as we’ve come to accept that the unknown unknowns will always be there, sitting just outside of our view, just beyond our models. We know that the key is not to rigidly plan for the ‘event’ but rather to train and build our systems (physical, electronic, social, financial, et al) to quickly recover and adapt, to build in resilience.

Ambient persuaders

I’ve long been a fan of ambient signifiers in design systems, and I believe that the notion of things quietly guiding us is going to be a lot more common and lot more talked about this year. Architects and designers have long used ambient techniques to ‘guide’ the people engaging with their systems. Sometimes in architecture these aren’t so subtle and feel brutal or oppressive such as using scale to intimidate. Other times they provide that all important hint, that almost invisible signal that draws you in the right direction. The first example of this I came across was courtesy of Peter Morville, in his brilliant book Ambient Findability. He talked about how the chimes on the Tokyo metro were ambient signifiers for each of the metro lines — subtle hints to help commuters sense which train is at the platform. Many of these ambient (even subliminal) techniques track all the way back to propaganda and advertising, nudging people to think, feel or behave in the ‘desired’ way. For more the new use of ambient is not quite so sinister as it’s more about raising those hidden persuaders just into view but still leveraging all their power. With the interest in behavioural economics, the idea of ‘nudging’ people to make better decisions has become an acceptable concept for policy makers and designers alike. The differentiator here is that it’s about encouraging people to do something that they may not want to do in order to gain longer term benefits for themselves or society as a whole. What makes it ambient is that it’s not a heavily enforce rule or policy. It’s merely part of the context that the activity is taking place in or inherent to the way the process for that activity has been constructed. It’s all about a hint, a nudge, a suggestion to do it ‘this way’ over ‘that’ — it’s the designed path of least friction, or that annoying notifier that simply must be cleared. These nudges and hints are Buckminster-Fullers ‘trim tab’ the tiny element that moves the enormous ship. Behavioural design has been a hot topic for a while. With the rise is self monitoring, digital health and our algorithmic overlords, these ambient persuaders and nudgers will start to get used more and more as no want wants an artificially intelligent MS Office Clippy, nagging away at us. To discover a little more about designing for ambient signals, take a look at the brilliant work by Dan Lockton and his Design with Intent toolkit.

Ambiguity

With all the AI and algorithmic advances, the things that make us uniquely human need to be talked about a lot more. One of the incredible things humans do better than machines is dealing with ambiguity. Most UI and mechanical design is essentially an exercise in removing ambiguity so that only the single correct action is performed by the machine. But that’s mainly because of the mechanical interface (buttons, levers, GUI etc). What happens when the interface is more human, when it’s fully gestural and spoken, when we interact with the machine in the same way as we do with other people? When we talk to each other much of the intended meaning is alluded too, suggested, is based on shared understanding or is playful, subtle and deliberately full of ambiguity. Language twists and turns and morphs within the groups that use it. If you are from outside the group, the references, meanings and jokes are not always apparent or even noticed. If you have ever been the non native speaker (and the new person) sitting with a relaxed group of long term friends, you’ll know what I mean. You often don’t have the same reference points, so miss the subtlety, the miss direction and the double talk. With time you learn to spot the ambiguity and often resolve it. That’s really hard for an algorithm or machine to do, as its an open, endless space where the contexts are incredibly rich and sophisticated (potentially an entire shared cultural history which is both public and private). It’s not the closed language of a mechanical process. The communicator knows what they mean and those listening need to resolve the ambiguities to hopefully come to an understanding that at leasts aligns with what is being said. Ambiguity is everything thing beyond the order word, it’s gossip, banter and in jokes. It’s real conversation. As we talk more about machines engaging us directly and ‘thinking’ ahead to meet our needs, they need to be ready to handle ambiguity. After all when I say “I love corgis” what do I really mean?

The (unfortunate) return of the Maven

Although user/people centric design has made huge head ways over the last 5 years, there’s still a lot of push back on participatory and truly collaborative design practices. Last year really pushed hard on the empowered teams meme and the rise of hive structured organisations. But many organisations have been bitten by trying to force this on people and structures that weren’t ready. Usually this is down to mandating wholesale new ‘processes’ written in stone before they have ever beens used by the people expected to work with them. All process, no point. That belief that whatever this new project/process management is, it will save us, it will make us innovative and great. However, often where they expected innovation and rapid advances then ended up with disruption (and not in a good way), inferior products and failed teams. It’s not a fault with collaborative and empowered teams, it’s simply the process and its implementation. The thing is, I fear that these failures open the door to those who don’t believe in the team as creators and owners, and only see them as the means of production. As such it sets up the lone genius, the grand architect, or the ‘great man’ to step in and force their genius upon the rest of us. Trouble is, at best they exclude, own, mythologise and stop groups advancing and at worst they work in such isolated bubbles that they don’t ever engage with the people who may actually need whatever they make. We do need them as they occasionally have great breakthroughs, they have their black swan moments, but don’t build your company around them, don’t accept their myth. Even those who we believe are these singular geniuses almost always have their partners, teams and are never really alone. So empower all the people in your organisation to be part of doing great things, and avoid relying on the man behind the curtain. There’s no resilience with mavens.

Emotional sensing

There was a lot of talk about empathy and emotional understanding last year, especially in the product design arena. This included a healthy debate about what we mean by ‘empathy’, which included some great work defining the many facets of empathy and where and when we use them. This seemed to culminate in the release of Practical Empathy by Indi Young — a thorough analysis and methodology for using empathetic thinking in product, services and design research. I think this year we are going to hear a lot more about capturing and quantifying that type of deep emotional and qualitative information through the use of sensors. This is not really the toolkit of Indi (which is talking with people, face to face and understanding them) but rather that of the data scientist — analysing the large behavioural and sensory datasets around activities. The advances in wearable, relatively cheap, non-intrusive sensors has opened the door to accessing bio diagnostics that can be used to indicate emotional responses. It’s surprising how much can be derived from heart rate, pulse and a good understanding of the context of the activity. This has obvious benefits to researchers, and there were a few nice examples last year. Firstly one from Cities Unlocked, where they used emotional sensing to map the experiences of blind people as they travelled around the city. A true piece psychogeography if ever there was. The second was a piece about using emotional sensors to look deeper at how children play and the insights this gives toy makers such as Lego. This year we will hear more about this, including consumer services driven from the quantified self movement. Already we have pplkpr a service and product that uses sensors and context to track your emotional engagement with your ‘friends’. However the real power comes when we combine the both the face to face and the sensory data, as this gives you an incredibly rich understanding of the emotional experiences of an individual or group as well as their values and motivations. So don’t leave out the human interaction and our amazing empathetic skills when embracing the sensors and the lure of all that quantitative data.

Personal data rights

I’m not sure we have a widely accepted term for this yet, but it’s something people have been talking around for a while. It’s not about the data that others hold about us, rather it’s the data that we generate through our behaviours and activities that we could hold and own ourselves. It’s essentially the quantified self and our rights to control and own the data that we create and any data that concerns us. Part privacy, part big data, part behavourial economics and very much about the rights of use and it’s value. Recently I heard the phrase Personal Data Stores and that goes some way to describing it. It’s the total body of data generated by me and about me, it’s my digital self and the use of this data. As this debate unfolds further we need to take a look at ownership, governance and rights of the individual versus the system or entity that recorded or tracked the data. If I am the product then I’m going to also be the one ‘selling’ me — it could be time for you to request access to my API and pay for use.

So that’s my six: Resilience, Ambient persuaders, Ambiguity, Mavens, Emotional sensing and Personal data rights.

Of course I’m no sage or clairvoyant so in all likelihood they may not have even registered by this time next year, but it will be fun to come back and see.

Infamy in the Age of the Internet,"It seems that random acts of violence are happening more and more. With every incident we have the same conversation about where the media should put its focus.

I wanted to wait a bit and not chime in directly after the recent Oregon shooting because I actually don’t want to dive into the particulars of that event and the debates about naming the shooter.

It’s suffice to say that the young man who killed people that day wanted to live and die in “infamy.” So let’s talk about that human desire: “Infamy.”

What I want to do first and foremost is put these kinds of events in historical perspective. It is not a new phenomena. And so when I hear talking heads trying to ascribe these activities to some kind of modern illness, I fear we are missing the point. I have a general philosophy: The internet doesn’t create new human behaviors/motivations. It just exposes existing ones and puts them in new context.

Herostratic fame

One of the 7 ancient wonders of the world was the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. It was said of the temple by Antipater of Sidon:

“I have set eyes on the wall of lofty Babylon on which is a road for chariots, and the statue of Zeus by the Alpheus, and the hanging gardens, and the colossus of the Sun, and the huge labour of the high pyramids, and the vast tomb of Mausolus; but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, ‘Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand.’”

The ruins of the temple remain in Ephesus and I had the great pleasure of traipsing among those ruins a few years ago.

So what happened to the temple? It was burned down by a young man Herostratus. Don’t let his name fool you. This man was an arsonist in the 4th century BC. Not only did he burn down the Temple of Artemis, he sought credit for it. He proudly exclaimed that he was the person who burnt down the temple. He wanted to become “infamous” for the deed.

In response, Ephesian authorities not only executed him, they made mention of his name punishable by death. “Herostratus” became “he who must not be named.” It was their attempt at seeking justice (a restoration of balance) in response to the actions he took to try and become notorious.

In the end, their attempts failed. The historian Theopompus reported the event in his book “Hellenics.” Today “Herostratic fame” is a rarely used figure of speech which could be applied to many of the people who commit acts of violence in order to gain the world’s attention.

The Questions I’m Left With

I don’t have any talking head statements about how these situations should be handled. I only have questions.

With the hindsight of several thousand years, do we think Theopompus did the right thing? Today we know how one of the ancient wonders of the world crumbled. Herostratus also got what he wanted.

Are modern reporters analogous to Theopompus?

Is the Ephesian technique of scrubbing a perpetrator’s name from history even possible today? An old boss of mine (who I would quote if we weren’t under Chatham House rules at the time) recently said in a conversation that “the Internet is a giant copying machine.” One utterance is all it takes.

Even if the internet makes scrubbing the name from history impossible, do individuals have a responsibility if/how they share the perpetrator’s name.

I noted that I don’t believe the internet creates new human motivations, but it does put them in new context. In a world where people KNOW with certain confidence their “infamy” will be assured (via the Internet) are we setting ourselves up to experience these more frequently.

Is there a difference in how we approach a crazed individual who seeks fame and a crazed ideology or group that seeks attention/power. I’m thinking here about violent propaganda images from groups like ISIS or the KKK’s propaganda from the early 20th century, etc. One could argue that these groups must be noticed and addressed head on in order to combat them. The notoriety they seek can’t be left unchallenged.",https://medium.com/personal-growth/infamy-in-the-age-of-the-internet-3ae37ae11dc,['David Cohn'],2015-10-09 09:07:27.045000+00:00,"['Religion', 'Violence', 'ISIS']"

Add Tagging to your Laravel App,"In recent years, tagging systems have become a popular way of categorizing items, and you can find them in almost every app. From blog posts to todo lists, they all have tagging implementations.

Let’s look at how easy integrating a tagging system is in a Laravel app. In the Laravel Links app I created a few weeks back I decided to add tagging to the links and what follows is instructions for setting it up.

Installing a Tagging package

The community has created several tagging packages, and you will need to research which one suits your use case. Here are three of the most popular ones I found:

I choose the Laravel Tagging package by rtconner, and the installation is simple.

First require the package:

composer require rtconner/laravel-tagging ""~2.0""

Open config/app.php and add it to the providers array:

Conner\Tagging\Providers\TaggingServiceProvider::class,

Now run publish the vendor folder with Artisan:

php artisan vendor:publish --provider=""Conner\Tagging\Providers\TaggingServiceProvider""

Finally, migrate the database:

php artisan migrate

Now we are ready to add the trait to our model. My model is named “Links.php” and here is the class:

use Conner\Tagging\Taggable;



class Links extends Model

{

use Taggable;



protected $table = 'links';

That is all it takes to get setup and ready to use; however, it leaves out an important step. Tagging typically needs JavaScript and styling to make it easy for the user to select an existing tag or add a new one.

Installing jQuery and Selectize

Selectize by Brian Reavis is a jQuery based plugin that turns an input field into a tagging system. This plugin can easily be installed through NPM and then setup using Browserify with Elixir.

In your terminal install jQuery and Selectize and automatically save them to your package.json with the following:

npm install jquery --save

npm install selectize --save

If you open package.json now you should see the following dependencies:

""dependencies"": {

""laravel-elixir"": ""^3.0.0"",

""bootstrap-sass"": ""^3.0.0"",

""jquery"": ""^2.1.4"",

""selectize"": ""^0.12.1""

}

Bootstrap and Elixir come pre-included in a default Laravel install. Which will now use to finish off the installation.

Create a file resources/assets/js/app.js and include the following:

window.$ = window.jQuery = require('jquery')

require('selectize');

var bootstrap = require('bootstrap-sass');



$( document ).ready(function() {

$('#tags').selectize({

delimiter: ',',

persist: false,

valueField: 'tag',

labelField: 'tag',

searchField: 'tag',

options: tags,

create: function(input) {

return {

tag: input

}

}

});

});

What this is going to do is utilize browserify to pull in jQuery, Selectize, and Bootstrap JavaScript into our file. We assign jQuery to the window so that plugins can read it from the global scope. Then we are assigning the Selectize Plugin to any input with the id of “tags”.

Before we can compile, we need to adjust our gulp file.

elixir(function(mix) {

mix.sass('app.scss')

.browserify('app.js');

});

The unique change here is the call to browserify. That call allows our “require” lines to pull in the proper dependencies.

Bootstrap Styles

Since Bootstrap is already included we can utilize it to handle our styles. Open app.scss and uncomment this line:

@import ""node_modules/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap"";

This will pull in bootstrap directly from the node_modules directory.

All that is left is to pull in styles for Selectize. The plugin ships with bootstrap support and it’s just a matter of importing that css file:

@import ""node_modules/selectize/dist/css/selectize.bootstrap3"";

Now if you run gulp everything should compile, and your views will display properly.

Displaying and Saving Tags

In our template, we need to create two new items. An input field for adding tags and a JavaScript array of existing tags so Selectize can autocomplete.

In our controller pull out all existing tags and assign them to the view:

$tags = Links::existingTags()->pluck('name');

return view('create', compact('tags'));

Then in our create template add the tags input:

<input type=""text"" name=""tags"" id=""tags"">

Next a new JavaScript array of tags:

var tags = [

@foreach ($tags as $tag)

{tag: ""{{$tag}}"" },

@endforeach

];

Now when the form is submitted create the model and attach the tags:

// Create the link first

$link = Links::create([...]); // Now add tags

$link->tag(explode(',', $request->tags));

With this all set you should now be able to save tags and autocomplete existing tags.

More tagging options

The Laravel Tagging package includes a lot more features than what has been shown so far. Here is a list of all available features:

Eager Loading

$link = Link::with('tagged')->first(); // eager load

Removing Tags

$link->untag('laravel'); // remove Laravel tag

$article->untag(); // remove all tags

Syncing Tags

$link->retag(['tutorial', 'package']); // delete current tags and save new tags

Fetching by Tag

Link::withAnyTag(['laravel','tutorial'])->get(); // fetch with any tag listed Link::withAllTags(['package', 'php'])->get(); // only fetch with all the tags

Beastly Soup,"My son:

Your name — the same now. . . how many years? Your mummy and I decided to name and feed you as we pleased. Little did we know. Now you have become as you are, and I have decided to write, so as to let you know a little bit about yourself.

You were born:

Beastly Soup, we wanted a refund. A nickel, boy. That is what we would have taken — a nickel for your carcass. You were worth no more than that of what makes babies cute and astonishing. For you slept with your eyes open, they would not focus but only floated around in a blank apathy. Your mouth was dry, your lips chapped. You coughed incessantly, hacked like an old man who has smoked his whole life. One day your mummy and I looked in and found the cat sitting on your chest. The demon Purr was bent over, its mouth close to yours. Here was superstition in the flesh, and we prayed it would suck the breath from your body. We swayed to the enchanted scene, sung silently: “Asphyxiate! Suffocate!” But Purr jumped off, having seen us and become offended. I rushed forward, pillow in hand, to finish the job. It was mummy who stopped me. “No, sweetie,” she said. “Not like that.” As if we were going to discuss it. Come up with a better way. That’s what I thought. But maybe we forgot. Because we never got around to it, and you continued to grow, as inexplicably as a mushroom.

For days, sometimes for weeks, we forgot to feed or even water you. Then suddenly we would remember, “Beastly Soup!” It was like a game. Off we went, to search the house until we found you, found the place you had crawled into — once behind the water heater, where you stayed, still, like a turtle. We had to reach in to wrench you out from behind the pipes. We didn’t think you were alive. Put you down, cold and stiff as marble. It was only when the second commercial came around that we looked down to see the little puddle of urine you had made. “It’s peeing!” your mummy cried. “When does it drink?” I wondered. “We never see it drink.” In a way, we were pleased. Your survival instincts were accurate.

The years wore on:

Your mummy grew a mustache. The hair on her head grew thin and gray. I grew a belly, large and taut as a drum. Life was good. One day, we decided to let you out. Into the garden. To forage! There you must have prospered, for the bushes wiggled with your presence. “He’s in that one,” I whispered from the porch. “Is he?” mummy whispered back with a wink. We threw stones — none too big, we were just having fun — to see you panic and bolt from one bush to another. You grew like a snake in the garden. At times, you startled us.

One year, the rain came in great volume, more than in the ten years preceding. The ground was flattened by mud, all vegetable matter was depressed and anemic. The garden became a dripping and leafless place. One morning, I chased your mummy, both of us naked and screaming with limitless joy, through the copious mud. She tripped, and I was instantly on top of her. Through her insane fucking laughter and spitting of mud she was trying to say something. “I can’t hear you,” I said. “What?”

“Beastly Soup!”

We looked around. It was in that very moment that we grasped the somewhat shocking truth. You were no longer in the garden. You were no longer in our lives. That field of mud was devoid of you, it was clear. During one of our long periods of forgetfulness you must have gone out of the garden and down the driveway and along the long road that leads to town and farther even, thank God, because you were never seen again.

Until the second decade of the following century:

When we found out that you had circumnavigated the world. And though you walked in a straight line, it never took you anywhere either. Which is kind of funny when you think about it. Mummy covers her mouth now when she laughs, on account of no teeth. She laughs often. Her mind is gone. She sits in the chair all day long, looking at the garden. She has no idea it’s you there, trembling under the porch. I tell her it’s just the skunks in the crawl space under the house and that I’ll hose them out. This serves to animate her. The old self comes alive again. “Yes,” she cries, clapping, then holding her hand over her mouth and laughing. “Hose them out!”",https://medium.com/revolver-reader/beastly-soup-dca10126e456,['Roger Mensink'],2015-11-13 19:15:15.768000+00:00,"['Fiction', 'Short Story', 'Literature']"
The Grand Tour,"http://thelandy.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/dsc_0221.jpg?w=636 Used with Permission

“To answer your question,” the tour guide said, “it will be necessary to give some background detail.”

Pulling the microphone close to his face and clutching it with both hands as if holding something precious, and leaning toward the passengers, he started, “But because I am just a guide on this bus-tour who you probably believe is in this job because I have few employment options or little specialized knowledge that would qualify me for a high status job in the information economy, you would likely not accept what I have to say.”

Pulling himself upright as if to stand at attention and taking the microphone in his left hand, he shifted his right hand to hold it — open-palmed — over his heart. “So, before I start let me disclose that I am actually the Prime Minister of this exotic country, and I have merely posed as a tour guide to discover what visitors to our homeland want most from their stay in this place.” As he finished this statement he closed his eyes and bowed from the chin toward the tourists — who by now had stopped fiddling with their cellphones and cameras and were fixed on this suddenly-more-interesting guide for what they may have thought would be a lazy afternoon tour.

After a few seconds pause, “Now that you know I am actually a credible source of information I can answer your question, confident that you will take me seriously.”

As the tour-guide-turned-Prime-Minister paused to inhale and relaxed to a contrapposto stance before answering the visitor’s question, another tourist in the dim space near the back of this tour bus cleared her throat and said in a high-pitched voice with an accent native to this place,

“We are members of the opposition in this country. Mister Prime Minister, you have long made us feel like strangers in our own cities, and since you asked for questions and desires for our stay in this beautiful place, we will take the opportunity to present our demands.”

Hearing this, the Prime Minister stiffened, tilting his head slightly and squinting warily as he peered toward the voice. Catching his balance after the bus hit a pothole, he reached up to grab the luggage rail above the seats.

The newly-announced opposition leader slowly stood, still mostly hidden in the shadows, as several other people who were also — only moments ago — merely tourists, produced a 3-ring binder and passed it over to their spokeswoman.

Receiving the binder the spokeswoman for the opposition slowly opened it to the first page and adjusted her glasses. Clearing her throat again with an audible squeak in her voice as the bus hit a pothole in what was otherwise a very smooth road, she started in quick and distinctly enunciated speech.

“We want to be recognized as a legitimate party in perpetual opposition. We want to be able to enter the cameral chambers with messages from those we represent. We don’t actually expect to be influential because we believe that appearances matter and we believe that all developed nations must have an opposition, while this nation has never had one.”

The spokeswoman continued with the list of demands — one statement on each page of the notebook — slowly turning each page and never looking up as she went. Other members of the opposition sat silently, watching the still motionless Prime Minister as she read — transfixed — from the binder.

Finally, the speaker for this newly-announced opposition slowly closed the back cover of the binder, passed it to another individual, then pulled off her glasses and folded them deliberately before looking up at the Prime Minister — hands at her sides as if waiting in a queue with others for bread at a local bakery the bus had just passed.

After a few very long minutes of silence while the bus decelerated to navigate a series of hairpin turns on bluffs overlooking a calm bay leading to the open ocean, the Prime Minister pulled the microphone back to his face, and spoke in a voice becoming of a Prime Minister, “I have been eagerly awaiting this day and have taken this job as a tour guide just so strangers and newcomers to our country who were so far without a voice could bring to me their questions and expectations. I agree with you that all important countries must have an opposition and I welcome you to our system of government. I hereby accept all of your demands expect the one granting access to the cameral chambers.”

As the bus swerved sharply to the right to pull into the parking lot from which it had started, members of the suddenly-official but yet unnamed opposition murmured animatedly among themselves. The bus lurched to a stop at the curb at the end of the planned tour — a small compound that doubled as a souvenir stand and picnic barbecue restaurant.

While passengers on the tour rose to exit the bus, still murmuring excitedly to their compatriots, the Prime Minister returned to his role as tour guide, cautioning the exiting passengers to collect their belongings and to use care as they stepped down the narrow stairway off the bus.

Departing passengers who were now also aspiring-political-actors collected in groups just outside the bus, posing for photos with the new opposition leader, all smiling broadly in a warm and welcoming manner particular to residents of this place, giving enthusiastic thumbs-up and Churchillian V-for-victory gestures.

Last to exit were the only two authentic tourists — previously seated on the last bench of the tour bus — squinting as they emerged from the darkened interior, slowly descending to the parking lot into blindingly clear sunshine at this dawning of a new day for politics in this exotic place.

After landing with a jolt on the last and longest step to the pavement, the first tourist turned to help his companion as she followed down. They adjusted their shoulder bags and pulled their cellphones from their pockets to take a few snapshots as they limped across the lot toward the well- marked public facilities.

Turning to her companion, she mused “Quite a lovely place, don’t you think?”

“Indeed,” nodding in her direction as he scrolled through the cellphone photos he had taken on the bus ride. “We were fortunate to get seats on this bus. We should find out what tour company everyone else was with. They seemed to have things very well organized.” Holding his camera to his companion, he pointed to a photo of the Prime-Minister at the front of the bus, “And they planned for entertainment as well!”

They parted to visit their respective destinations as the smell of barbecue began filling the parking lot, still unaware that they had just received what was perhaps the best introduction imaginable to the inner workings of this aspiring and newly-modern paradise, on what turned out to be the most curious example of a party-bus, ever encountered.",https://medium.com/microcosm/https-images-duckduckgo-com-iu-u-http-3a-2f-2ftoysoftimespast-com-2fwp-content-2fuploads-2f2013-4506bc1c8dc8,['Don Winiecki'],2015-11-12 16:19:55.895000+00:00,"['Flash Fiction', 'Politics', 'Tour Bus']"
Natural Order vs Predictive Power,"Transformations of the feature space typically come with a natural ordering of the transformed features. For instance, the commonly used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) produces transformed features (or principal components) that are sorted according to how much of the original dataset’s variance is captured by a principal component. Accordingly, the first principal component captures more of the original dataset’s variance than the second component and so on.

Feature selection is a staple of the machine learning process and aims to increase model performance and reduce model complexity by eliminating features that do not provide much value to the model. Intuitively, feature selection eliminates features that are either irrelevant to the predictive task at hand or features that are redundant. The natural ordering of transformed features serves as a good heuristic for eliminating features. For instance, a common practice is to include principal components that explain the bulk majority of the variance in the original dataset (say 98%) and discard the rest. Nice and simple, right? or is it?

As it turns out, there is no guarantee that the natural ordering of principal components (for instance according to the amount of variance they explain) will match the ordering of principal components according to their predictive power (how much do they make the model better at predicting the target variable). It could very well be the case that a higher principal component PCj has more predictive power than a lower principal component PCi (where i < j) even though PCi explains more of the data’s variance than PCj.

The key intuition behind this observation is that PCA (and other statistical feature transformation techniques) are unsupervised statistical learning procedures where no particular target feature is being optimized for, rather the model is optimizing for a better representation of the underlying statistical structure of the data (according to some metric). In short, the target variable of the overarching prediction process is irrelevant to the feature transformation procedure.

In their brilliant book “Applied Predictive Modeling”, Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson give a simple example of a binary classification task where, on a particular (real) dataset, the second principal component PC2 (in this case accounting for only about 8% of the variance in the data) separates the two possible outcome classes in a much better manner than the first principal component PC1 (which in this case accounts for 92% of the variance in the data). The difference in predictive power can be seen clearly from the box plots below: PC2 exhibits a lot less overlap between the two classes than PC1 and consequently PC2 has more predictive power than PC1.

Irish broadcaster uses faith to make journalism truthful,"Growing up in Ireland David Blevins loved English and telling stories. He knew journalism is what he wanted to do. He also felt the presence of God calling him to the ministry. It wasn’t till a pastor at his church told him to seek out another job and if God is truly calling you he will lead you. Blevins took that advice and went to college to become a journalist. After four years at a university, he climbed the rungs of the journalist ladder. First he started as a volunteer at a radio station, than he was able to get a job at a local weekly newspaper, he finally hit it big when he landed a job as a broadcaster for Sky News.

“I’m not a Christian journalist, I’m a journalist who is also a Christian,” Blevins said.

In times of tragedy Blevins looks to his faith to not only get him through tough times but others. Blevins says that the Bible calls for the truth to be told and that’s how he conducts his journalism. He has never denied a story based on his Christian values because of the need for truth in his work. Blevins had worked 29 years in journalism when he finally felt the call of God. He did a lot of thinking before making his decision to study theology for three years. During that three years he was able to strengthen his faith and apply a deeper understanding in his journalism. His strong faith has made him a leader in the Christian journalism world.

“He stood out as one of the leaders at the (Poynter) conference,” Professor Phyllis Alsdurf said about Blevins.

Alsdurf, an English and journalism professor at Bethel University met Blevins at the Poynter conference for Christian journalists. She said he was really outgoing and had a great passion for his work. Alsdurf was able to turn that connection into getting Blevins to come speak at Bethel. Blevins turned the Eastlund Room into a place full of emotion. His charismatic personality along with sad stories of the Irish war lead to laughs filling the room into a quiet somber room. He shared tales of his journey through life and how Christianity has shaped him as a journalist.

“I thought it was cool to see how he integrated his faith into his reporting but knew where to draw the line,” said Joseph Hanson, a student who attended his lecture.

Blevins is a man who thinks that you can’t be a good reporter without understanding religion. He said that if you don’t know religion you’ll never know the full story. After his time studying theology he looked at news in a different way, he felt for the victims and their families. They weren’t just a story for him. They were people. God had given him the opportunity to go deeper in his faith and that helped him in his career.

“Ireland needs reporters who understand religion,” Blevins said.",https://medium.com/bethel-bytes/irish-broadcaster-uses-faith-to-make-journalism-truthful-ed315657bfbf,['Carson Selin'],2015-12-11 18:11:59.962000+00:00,"['Religion', 'Bethel University', 'Christianity']"
Anything For The Gram,"Getting it/ Photo by @Sandiegochris

Anything For The Gram

An Instagram Story

Instagram started as a clever app for users to share photos instantly. With the touch of a filter, a meaningless photo of breakfast could be turned into a creative work of “art.” Naturally, the Internet called it “hipster,” but this labeling didn’t last long.

The Instagram of today has evolved. While there’s still an abundance of Harry Styles and Justin Bieber pictures on the Popular (Explore) Page, Instagram as a whole has evolved into a community. Many of the friends I have today are people that I’ve met through Instagram.

I live in San Diego, CA. I moved here a little over two years ago, and for the first year, I didn’t know many people other than my girlfriend. Then in May of 2012 I met a friend though work who was posting incredible photos on Instagram. These photos were so good that I assumed he was using a DSLR, but he wasn’t…he was using an iPhone. I was blown away, and from that moment on I was hooked. We spent hours exploring the city, looking for new places to shoot. Since I wasn’t native to San Diego, this gave me a means of viewing the city in a way I never could have before. It became a challenge to find new places and take the best photos possible. At times I’m sure it seemed like an obsession, (I know my girlfriend thought it was) but it made me feel alive.

I’ve spent many evenings on beaches and piers waiting for the sun to set just so I could capture it. If you’ve ever been to San Diego you know that the beaches are definitely tourist hotspots. There’s always people taking pictures with tripods and big cameras, and here we were with our little iPhones — climbing over rocks, getting blasted by waves and doing just about anything to get the shot. “Anything for the gram” became our mantra (side note — get some sort of protection plan for your smartphone, it’s worth it).

Since those initial few months, I’ve met many creative and inspiring people through Instagram. People who have pushed me and welcomed me with open arms. People like me that love to explore and get a rush from taking great photos. It might sound strange, but Instagram has united us. We collaborate, we inspire, and we help each other grow. We’re a family. Some of my closest friends today are people I’ve met through Instagram. Two years ago I felt lost in this city, and now I’m finally home.

With the devices we have today, you can create exceptional photos with nothing more than a smartphone and a few apps. If you’ve ever been interested in mobile photography, I urge you to give Instagram a try.

Internet hoaxes and patriotism,"It’s time for another edition of your beloved column. Let’s face it, you can’t really do without me. I should probably check to see if I can claim this column as a tax deduction under 80C.

Our first question comes from a gullible reader who has fallen prey to yet another Internet hoax:

Dear Know-it-all, I went to the movies with my friends today. We only had two options at our local theatre — The Conjuring and Chennai Express. Since we were in the mood for some scares, we chose to see Chennai Express. I recently received a forwarded email which mentioned that anything Deepika says in her Tamil accent, when played backwards, reveals Satanic messages which affect the viewers subliminally. Is that true? – living in fear

Dear living in fear,

Don’t be silly. It’s common knowledge that you don’t need to play her dialogues backwards to hear those messages.

It’s like no one has even heard of snopes. The next question comes from a self-proclaimed Indian patriot. Yeah, one of those guys:

Dear know-it-all, Why is the government trying to push the changes to the RTI act? Does it think that all Indians are idiots and will let them do it? – A true patriot.

Dear true patriot,

I don’t know about other Indians being idiots, but you certainly are one. Can’t you see that the call for amendments to the act has finally united all the political parties to fight for a common cause? Even the Independence Day speeches could not do that. I say it’s absolutely worth it even if takes a Right To Information Pact(see what I did there?) to get them to act together for once.

Dear Know-it-all, I’ve heard rumours that the recent cricket series between India and Zimbabwe was fixed. Was it? – A cricket fan

Dear cricket fan,

You’re right, that series was fixed. But now how you think — there were no towels or other signalling infrastructure involved. After making some detailed inquiries which included some frenzied Googling and asking Prabhakar to shoot some grainy videos, I’ve come to the inevitable conclusion — all the games were computer generated by the BCCI(I think Randy may be involved too). Now before you dismiss my claim citing the Law of Averages(even I have to be wrong one day), just answer the following question — have you ever met anyone who has claimed to have seen that particular series in person or on television? Exactly. Also, repeated attempts to get any information from Kohli who was the ‘captain’ for this ‘series’ were met with non-committal responses like ‘Who are you and what have you done to the real milkman?’ and ‘What are you doing inside my fridge?’ and ‘No, I will not give you my autograph on that!’ I rest my case.

That’s it for yet another edition. Just remember what a wise person once said before hitting that send button — ‘There’s no such thing as a stupid question, only stupid people who ask said questions.’

The beginning of an adventuRe,"A few years ago I had to present a research about social media to the board of an online magazine. I almost didn’t know where to start: Twitter in Italy was pretty new, but I felt it could have been good for our zero-budget magazine. After some research I discovered this paper about Twitter mining and sentiment analysis using a consonant: R.

That was my first encounter with R project. It didn’t end up well. Back then my laptop wasn’t so good and I managed to crash it at least 5 times before I could perform some basic analysis. To be fair, I had a problem as well with coding. My only experience in coding was in Html and CSS, and I wasn’t even so good at it.

What I didn’t understand is that I fell in love. Suddenly I realized that the web wasn’t just a huge noisy mess, but it could be organized, analyzed and exploited. I fell in love with data science.

At the time data science wasn’t such a buzzword, I would say almost nobody knew it existed. So my life went on. I was living like 90% of us in an Excel world: my master’s thesis tables wheighted about 40 mb. I almost started learning Visual Basic, but luckily enough I didn’t.

“Suddenly I realized that the web wasn’t just a huge noisy mess, but it could be organized, analyzed and exploited. I fell in love with data science.”

Data always intrigued me, I steadily look for new insights, charts, visualizations, studies, etc. I even got a job that for the most part is about data retrieving and analysis from many different countries (the next time you feel the urge to mock HR people, you may want to think twice about it: the work changed a lot in the last years). But the process with Excel was tedious and annoying. What could I do?

R ! A spark.

I remembered about that tiny little mess I did a while ago. I could remember those little arrows <- assigning variables, the way I queried Twitter’s API and how many times my laptop crashed. I took a decision: learn to code in R.

Fun fact, in high school I was bad in math. Really bad. I mean it. VERY BAD. But weirdly enough I was good in physics, economics and statistics. So I decided to take the challenge and study statistics as well.

I had the luck to find a few nice books on the subject, that I suggest to everyone interested in statistics and machine learning:

“Naked Statistics” by Charles Wheelan

by Charles Wheelan “The Signal and the Noise” by Nate Silver

by Nate Silver “Data Science for Business” by Foster Provost & Tom Fawcett

Resurrection trumps Religion,"Hebrews confronts one of the pressing problems of the emerging church in the first century — ie the ‘Judaising’ of Christianity. We will explore this more fully later but the question that this raises is ‘How is revelant to us in the 21st century?

How is the struggle with religion a modern and defining characteristic of Christianity? Is the gospel a form of religion or is it fundamentally not a religion and in fact is at odds with religion? Indeed is religion hostile to the gospel and suffocating?

Bonhoeffer’s problem:

Religion suffocates Revelation

One modern thinker who has helped confront these questions is Bonhoeffer. We will therefore take a little excursion into Bonhoeffer’s inquiries with a view to proving the point that far from being irrelevant, Hebrews confronts problems that are relevant today, and relevant to non-Jews as well as Jews. We can even say, more broadly, that Hebrews was unsuccessful: it failed to stop the Judaising of Christianity so what the writer feared has happened. Thus we are facing a version of Christianity that is distorted into a religion and so the argument of Hebrews — a plea to purify the gospel and be true to its core — is still relevant today. It is an unfinished argument.

Bonhoeffer’s dilemma illustrates how a 20th century theologian grappled intensely with the issue of a public Christianity and articulated it in language that is stark and illuminating — language that many of us can identify with. We should pay attention to Bonhoeffer because as we all know this was not a theoretical debate for him, but one that cost him his life. (I will be drawing on a brilliant conference speech on Bonhoeffer by the eminent philosopher Paul Ricouer and he emphasizes this point).

Dietrich Bonhoeffer in Tegel prison

Bonhoeffer saw ‘religion’ not as a thing, institution, or social category that defines a justifiable arena of human activities, but rather as a ‘psychology’ as a way of thinking, being and doing about life. Increasingly he saw it as a smokescreen that obscured our knowledge of God and distorted the picture of what God was doing. He struggled to imagine what he began to call a ‘religionless’ Christianity and what it would look like. Importantly he saw ‘religion’ as almost a contrast with being ‘fully human’. He saw that the cloak religion boxes Christianity into a small subset of human activity and therefore limits God’s interests -and indeed God’s claims — on all of life. He would, I think, have been happy with Edwin Judge’s avoidance of the term ‘Christian’ to describe himself. Perhaps most tellingly, he saw religion as diverting attention from not only being fully human, but from being fully Christ-like. This is because he identified Jesus as the archetypal human being, the template for humanity not the starter of a specialist clique whose interests were ‘technical’ religious.

Bonhoeffer’s definition of Religion

He defined ‘religion’ or the religion mindset, as composed of two ingredients

1) ‘Metaphysics’:

By this he meant something like ‘supernatural’. Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy but he did not mean that. The key worldview of the religious psychology is to split reality into two parts — an upper and lower part. The lower part is the world of physicality and the upper part is the world of meaning and spirituality. God gets assigned to the upper part and thus we live in a world where a second layer of reality is added to perceived reality. So God inhabits an outer ring that is optional to belief and at the margins.

a. So clearly in Bonhoeffer’s terms, God must own the material world and it must be central to his interests, not peripheral. Hence a doctrine of creation, must be at the core of discarding religion in favour of a religionless Christianity. The vision of creation must be expansive in scope and push every horizon.

b. Secondly in Bonhoeffer’s terms, we must ‘discover’ God — his patterns, imprints, character revealed — and recognize him in all aspects of this expansive creation. We must recognize his handiwork in it all.

c. Thirdly — and most pointedly — we must recognize the Logos in all of this creation. The Greek idea of Logos — as governing principle behind all creation — suits these purposes as we shall see in Hebrews. Ie the Greek idea of Logos introduced a very rich and flexible picture of creation as animated by meaning which on its own was then disembodied by Plato. But once united to the creation doctrines of Jewish thought, it unlocked a rich picture of creation as logos — which in turn opens the door to Christ as Logos.

d. Thus, as we discover God in any aspect of creation — we are discovering the Logos or Christ.

e. This is supported by the dominant argumentative role that creation plays in Hebrews but also throughout the OT in Psalms, Isaiah and Job to name a few.

2) Interiority

The second ingredient of religious mindset is the ‘interiority’ instinct. This means that, having banished God from the world of activities and matter, he is allowed to return to a private devotional space that is unthreatened by the public world, and makes no claims on the public world.

3) To this we need to add a third —

Morality as audit.

Today we are seeing an increasing claim by the religious mindset on the public space. But they are largely doing this without dismantling the metaphysics mindset. So a kind of ‘sacred’ censorship gets applied to the public space. Ie we take the profane v sacred and apply it to the public space. This is disastrous and inadequate as it ironically appears to be bold but ends being conservative. It forces religion on the public space but fails to recognise the stunning hand of God in the public space.

a. To really integrate we need to first reform the metaphysics mindset — the supernatural view of religion — and replace it with a radical creationism. Thus I see God in all things and this is revelation not just proposition.

b. Then we take a religionless view of God into the public space. We present ourselves as fully human not Christian.

This religious mindset condemns faith to the edges of life. This is what Bonhoeffer identified in the redemptive focus of much of Christianity. The tight links between sin, problems, healing and salvation — all directed at the individual soul — created a dynamic interlocking logic that turns Christianity into a specialist interest that occurs at the edges of life. It fails to answer or address big life questions around meaning, longevity, durability, joy, vocation, innovation, intimacy, physicality, social cohesion, smart thinking, human centred design, organisations, family cohesion, business and enterprise, inquiry and learning to name a few.

Schizophrenia of Sunday to Monday

In making what looks like a radical case for religionless Christianity we must remember that Edwin has told us that this was how the Roman audience interpreted what they heard of early Christianity. They did not hear it as religious nor did they call it a religion but rather a philosophy or even a political movement.

The World of First Century Jews

Having painted a picture of the modern challenges we face with religion — or even ‘Judaised Christianity’ — we can turn back to the first century Jews. As I do, don’t forget Bonhoeffer — I will be arguing that the writer to the Hebrews was also in search of a religionless Christianity.

My goal in now exploring the world of the Jewish audience and their problems is to walk a mile in their shoes. We must be prepared to empathise with them so that we can feel their pain and look at the world through their eyes. We know when we are beginning to empathise because we stop judging and start to feel, ‘Yes at first glance that looked stupid, but I can really feel myself doing the same thing now’.

Firstly understand that Judaism was not a homogenous social unit. They formed into five segments and only one remained in its first century form.

1) Pharisees who were the letter of the law guys. They emphasized the law above all else and it was they who created the para- biblical rules, commentaries and books that have ended up defining Judaism since the first century

2) The Sadducees who were tied to the temple and its rites. They were mortal intellectual enemies of the Pharisees and you can easily see this as Paul played them off against each other. Obviously they collapsed with the destruction of the temple.

3) The Zealots who were in favour of political rebellion against Rome.

4) The Essenes who were monastics who withdrew from life and whose writings we found in the Dead Sea Scrolls

5) The Baptisers who stressed personal repentance and were led at first by John the Baptist.

The early church thought of themselves as Jewish Baptisers

Our first paradigm shift is to recognize that the early Christians did not call themselves Christians — we probably know this but don’t recognize its significance. We assume they mentally identified themselves as the ‘early church’ — ie a non-Jewish, breakaway movement without a name yet. But in fact, it looks much more likely that they thought of themselves as a continuation of Jewishness not a complete break from it. This is the only way to explain their behavior and makes much more sense of a close reading of the Acts which we will get to in a moment.

But it also begins to make much more sense of Hebrews — as the letter that signals the rift where this new movement broke off from Judaism and finally realized it could never be integrated.

The Temple as the defining symbol of Judaism & religion

The defining symbol of this Jewish identity was the temple. It was not mere architecture but the hub of meaning in Jewish religion. This makes Jesus’ prophecy in Mark 13 epic and disrupting . In response to his disciples’ admiration of the temple buildings — wholly understandable given their scale and grandeur — he told them it would all be destroyed and dismantled. It is impossible for us to conceive how jolting this must have been. It is not like saying to an Australian, “The Opera House will be destroyed”, it meant that their whole social identity and hopes would be obliterated. This would demand a complete rethink of their identity.

“As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look Teacher what massive stones! What magnificent buildings!” Mark 13

Now we know for sure that Hebrews was written before the destruction of the temple, but it too seems to predict or imply the destruction. But it does more than imply the destruction. It prepares them for its destruction by envisioning a far broader ‘social project’ and destiny that God had in mind — this being the New Jerusalem. He declares at the end of the book that they are coming to a new community defined magnificently by Christ and prefigured by the saints of old — and in this way he seems to me to be laying out the groundwork for what emerged as the totally distinctive movement called ‘Christianity’ and the church.

The Acts of the Apostles illuminates the Jewish struggle

Let us turn now to the Acts as the only extended social history of the early church — or I would prefer say as the evolution of the church and its tensions to be born. We will look at it, literarily — as a drama or a novel capturing a very human journey of discovery as they stumbled towards their destiny — the social destiny that was always coded into the resurrection and the gifts of the Spirit but that they took a long time to recognize.

Traditionally I have looked at this book as a pretty mundane narrative because I could only see it as organized around the theme of ‘organic expansion of the gospel’ which turned it into a geography lesson. There were sermons punctuated throughout but I found these largely indistinguishable and pretty Jewish. And it seemed to peter away at the end, with no dramatic climax.

Now I want to offer a new reading that layers a much more intense drama across the narrative — essentially the long struggle for the baby of the gospel to escape from its domineering parent of Judaism. This domineering parent is represented by the city of Jerusalem in the book and we can now reinterpret the geographical expansion as a series of ever widening circles which are stretching the cords tying the gospel back to Jerusalem — not just in mileage but in thinking. However the struggle is costly and messy and in the end, costs Paul, the principal protagonist of the book dearly. In fact we can trace a secondary narrative throughout the book of the character and the journey of Paul. Luke does not idealise Paul or sugar coat his journey, but emerges for me as an extraordinary biographer, who trusts the tale and lets the events tell the story in all their unresolved and tortured detail. We end up with a very human picture of Paul that challenges the oft cited criticism that “Christianity” was an invention of the intellectual genius of Paul not Jesus. Far from that, Acts suggests that Paul reached the end of his talents and his abilities in the struggle to get free from Jerusalem, and the quest was picked up and accelerated by others, most notably Apollos.

The Dramatic plot structure of Acts

So in this structure of struggle here are the big sections of Acts.

1) The first section covers chapters one to nine: it finishes with Paul’s conversion but we should couple Paul’s conversion with the martyrdom of Stephen and his epic sermon to the Sanhedrin. His sermon reaches a climax with the great rhetorical question from Isaiah; “Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool; where kind of house will you build me?” says the Lord. This question throws down the gauntlet to the old Judaism, and challenges the temple as the centre of their faith. It suggests that God’s work lies way beyond the temple and its customs, in the entire earth and all of the works of men’s hands.

2) The next section is the Peter section between 10 and 11 and Paul’s early missionary journeys . Both of them describe movements into Gentile territory that is criticized by the Jewish Christians, and then discussed and arbitrated on by the council of elders in Jerusalem. Clearly Jerusalem is working as some kind of headquarters for the early believers and they are the ones who demand answers and set policy. The Council in chapter 15 is a major section that Luke gives a lot of attention to. James’ endorsement of the Gentiles is fair but hardly a ringing endorsement; we can identify the traces of conservatism in his judgment, and we can feel the tension in the room and Jerusalem as he gives his verdict. He does not say “Let the Gentiles believe independently, and follow Christ only with no regard to Mosaic Law”. He puts four stipulations on them, both moral and ceremonial. But his reasoning is strange to us: he says that they must abide by these four laws because “Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues every Sabbath”. He is justifying the ruling by Moses and the widespread influence of Jewish customs, synagogues and Sabbath keeping. His reasoning does not emanate from the dying and rising of Jesus.

3) Then we have the long section of Paul’s further missionary journeys

4) Then Acts finishes with the longest section of all — beginning at Chapter 20 we see Paul’s emotional journey back to Jerusalem. We can read between the lines and recognize this is a deep thing for him. It is not a mere tactical return, and it is not like a missionary returning for R and R. This is an affair of the heart; his heart remains in Jerusalem and he wants to give them every chance to come with him to the full journey in Christ. We know that he is filled with foreboding and does not really expect to succeed and in fact this journey back is marked by poignant scenes of farewell and indeed by criticism or disagreement from other Christians who clearly do not think it is a good thing to go back to Jerusalem. Paul expects conflict there.

When he arrives back we see an violent mix of two ingredients: on the one hand, Paul’s strange attempt to compromise with Judaism, and on the other the fearsome extremism of the unbelieving Jews — whom we can only describe as ungovernable, fundamentalist jihadists. All of my sympathies lie with the poor Roman governor trying to make sense of it all and calm everyone down!

But the thing to note is that Paul’s presence caused uproar within days of his arrival — but the continued presence of James and the elders and the believing Jews had NOT caused any such uproar. In fact, they were living somewhat peaceably and they implored Paul to continue to keep the peace — by demonstrating that ‘you yourself are living in obedience to the law’. SO we can only assume that they were participating in Jewish customs, the temple traditions and keeping Moses law while also defining themselves as believers in Christ.

I would posit therefore that they thought of themselves, and defined themselves, and presented themselves as the Jewish Baptiser group, not a breakaway movement.

A new voice emerges from a new city

While this was going on a new voice emerges in Acts — Apollos. Luke gives us a detailed and careful portrait of him and his abilities, that we should read carefully.

Importantly he is from the city of Alexandria, and we need to explain what that means in the ancient world. Clearly he was a product of that city and it remarkable culture. In this city Greek thought and Jewish thought collided and intertwined — it was a productive conversation. This could happen because both movements were in a sense free of their old origins and its limiting hold — they met on neutral territory and in a new context where the old guards had no power.

Philo, Alexandria and the Greek ‘Logos’

In that city, the dominant force among the Jews was the brilliant and influential Jewish philosopher, Philo. Philo is famous for taking the Greek concept of Logos and integrating it into Jewish thought. He found the Logos a powerful and appealing idea, and mined it for its wisdom. It gave him a metaphor or a heuristic to explore God more fully and position God more broadly throughout creation. He could argue that God was not just a Jewish construct, revealed only to Moses but rather that God’s presence permeated all of creation, and all of thought.

He saw the Logos as the great bridge between God and Man — and indeed as the high priest. He identified the logos as the Melchizedek who integrated the mystery of God with the life of humanity on the planet.

Cleary we can see the huge influence of Philo on both John’s gospel and Hebrews. Both writers use the Logos concept heavily, but don’t subordinate their thinking to Philo’s Platonic worldviews. Rather they extend Philo — they agree with him that Logos is a useful way to think about God, and that it broadens the revelation from Jewish only customs to all of creation; that further it aligns nicely with a lot of Jewish scriptures about the revelation of God and indeed it feeds our reflections on the mysterious nature of God. They seem to nod in agreement towards some involvement of the Holy Spirit in the notion of Logos forming in Greek minds. Remember that Logos and Greek Philosophy had no idols and no pagan ceremonies built into them. So Philo was not studying ancient Greek religions (they did exist of course and the Greeks were idol worshippers but it was a marginalized movement in many ways and does not permeate the great Greek philosophers). So the interaction was between Jewish religion and Greek thought/philosophy NOT the Jewish religion and Greek religion. This was what proved fertile.

How John and Apollos extended Logos into Christ

But if Apollos and John had stayed with Philo they would have left Logos as a big Idea. Philo had no revelation of Christ (he preceded Christ by one generation) and so for him there was no incarnation. At best Philo was preparing Jewish thinkers by stretching their minds and their apprehensions — good soil into which the seed of Christ could fall.

So this remarkable man was positioned providentially — by skill, training and context and relationships — to move the gospel further away from the tug of Jerusalem indeed from religion itself, and out into the wide world of the earth and indeed the cosmos. He was in fact better positioned than Paul to do that, since I argue that Paul’s Jewish heritage got him in the end. In a way he was always an emotional prisoner to Jerusalem which was both a strength and a weakness.

The ‘Sins’ of Hebrews: ‘Judaising’ the gospel

Lets finish by looking at the book of Hebrews to identify from that book the problems that Apollos thought the believing Jews faced. What error were they committing, how was their thinking wrong, what dangers were they facing, what was their pastoral position?

You will know that Hebrews contains some dire warnings — and indeed it contains probably the most difficult and scary passage in the NT. Now these dire warnings are regularly used in the service of warnings today and generally in a moral way. We read them or they are preached as if we are facing moral bankruptcy.

Lets look at some of them.

(Chapter 2:1–3) How shall we escape of we neglect such a great salvation?

The sin in view is some kind of ‘neglect’ and the consequences seem pretty dire — as the word ‘escape’ suggests. If you “neglect” this salvation — what does that mean? The mind runs wildly here — try marrying that one to the Anglican confession that precedes every Sunday service! Would ‘neglect’ include not reading my Bible, not witnessing when I have the chance, sexual thoughts, moral shortcomings — even a hardening heart or a wandering mind?? And ‘how shall we escape’ suggests that something judgmental is imminent and we will have nowhere to run, nowhere to hide if we neglect it. You can see how fearful this verse sounds to the sensitive mind.

“See to it that none of you has a sinful unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God” (Chapt 3;12) & “Today if hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion”.

These all into similar territory, but it raised for me the even worse spectre that lack of faith will be my downfall. Since I am natural sceptic this is not very encouraging.

“Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.” (Chapt 4:13)

This raises the spectre of disobedience and falling away.

These all climax in the scariest of all Hebrews 6:3ff.

“It is impossible for those who were once enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God, and the powers of the coming age, if they shall fall away, to renew them again to repentance because they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.”

This is the scariest of all because at face value it seems to be saying that if we become apostate, we can never get back to faith again.

If you put all of these together, it makes Hebrews a threatening book, full of warnings and building a picture of a precarious kind of faith with an ominous God demanding that we keep up the standards — or else.

But let us now put these verses right back in the first century context that we have been painting.

1) The early believers were not a distinctive movement in their minds but rather an extension of the Jewish faith.

2) As such there was not a clean break socially, or in terms of social identity

3) Thus there was a critical tug of war between the old — represented by Jerusalem — and the new — represented by Rome or even Alexandria

4) As we shall see later, the new view — of the new city as it were — will extend the kingdom beyond ritual and religion in to all of creation. Thus we can see that the ‘Gentiles’ and accepting the Gentiles is code for a cosmic, non-ethnic defined view of the kingdom and interests of God.

5) The Jewish movement that was tugging the gospel back to the old core (Moses stood for this) was anchored in early believers not the unbelieving Pharisees.

6) This rump of the believers, was their emotional, heartfelt identity defining core and they were fully participating in Jewish customs, laws of Moses and temple rituals.

7) Given this, there was clearly an imminent danger that the new faith would get sucked back into its Jewish origins, get compromised and domesticated, lose its edge and become a ‘religion’.

8) The very heart of this debate was the scope and dominion of Jesus vis a vis the traditions and the law, the prophets and scriptures and indeed Moses.

In the light of this critically important situation we can see that Apollos was a strategic thinker who could identify that the entire faith was at a cross roads. It could get sucked back and lose its voice, or it could break free and fly unhindered towards its Jesus defined destiny. He was thus not confronting in Hebrews a mere pastoral issue, but a truly strategic issue of the future of Christianity. And this future was to be fought over the social shape it would take. So this was not a theoretical or doctrinal contest, it was a social contest. The Jerusalem movement was not fighting for a deliberate watering down of the Jesus message — I am not arguing that they were deliberately unbelievers. They were arguing for a social compromise, or compliance. They wanted Jewish behaviours to continue in terms of compliance with the religious rituals and the national identity. They wanted the temple worship and vows to continue — they were saying, rather like the church did centuries later in Germany, “Don’t worry about your private beliefs, but keep the social fabric preserved! Don’t rock the boat in terms of political, or social, or religious behaviours.” They were simply not taking Jesus seriously enough in Apollos’ mind.

He saw through all that. He recognized that the movement that God had begun in Jesus was revolutionary and cosmic in scope; it could not be contained in the old social wineskins of Judaism/religion. It must take an entirely new shape — that would allow the mesmerizing core to shine and radiate without any clouds or mists to dim it. It must be taken to its natural conclusions.

Thus the ‘sin’ that he was confronting, was the fearful prospect that we neglect this dramatic intervening voice of God, and that we underestimate Jesus and domesticate him, wrap him up inside the Jersualem customs and make him safe. The ‘sin’ was that we don’t rock the boat, we keep him not too threatening, rather than ask, “What has God done here, and how does that working challenge and redefine everything we know including our religion?” we ask instead, “How do we integrate God and religion, how do we demonstrate that we can have our cake and eat it too, how can we make Jesus fit into Jerusalem and Moses?”

It is the ‘sin’ of low vision, too little wonder and amazement, underestimating the ‘still small voice’ that crept into Bethlehem and into the human history in tiny vulnerable form and not realizing that, despite the lack of thunder and lightning, it was indeed God who was visiting us and speaking to us. How shall we escape if we neglect such a voice?

That was the day they killed the Son of God

On a squat hill-top by Jerusalem.

Zion was bare, her children from their maze

Sucked by the dream of curiosity

Clean through the gates. The very halt and blind

Had somehow got themselves up to the hill.

After the ceremonial preparation,

The scourging, nailing, nailing against the wood,

Erection of the main-trees with their burden,

While from the hill rose an orchestral wailing,

They were there at last, high up in the soft spring day.

We watched the writhings, heard the moanings, saw

The three heads turning on their separate axles

Like broken wheels left spinning. Round his head

Was loosely bound a crown of plaited thorn

That hurt at random, stinging temple and brow

As the pain swung into its envious circle.

In front the wreath was gathered in a knot

That as he gazed looked like the last stump left

Of a death-wounded deer’s great antlers. Some

Who came to stare grew silent as they looked,

Indignant or sorry. But the hardened old

And the hard-hearted young, although at odds

From the first morning, cursed him with one curse,

Having prayed for a Rabbi or an armed Messiah

And found the Son of God. What use to them

Was a God or a Son of God? Of what avail

For purposes such as theirs? Beside the cross-foot,

Alone, four women stood and did not move

All day. The sun revolved, the shadows wheeled,

The evening fell. His head lay on his breast,

But in his breast they watched his heart move on

By itself alone, accomplishing its journey.

Their taunts grew louder, sharpened by the knowledge

That he was walking in the park of death,

Far from their rage. Yet all grew stale at last,

Spite, curiosity, envy, hate itself.

They waited only for death and death was slow

And came so quietly they scarce could mark it.

They were angry then with death and death’s deceit.

I was a stranger, could not read these people

Or this outlandish deity. Did a God

Indeed in dying cross my life that day

By chance, he on his road and I on mine?

Speaking Out Against Toxic Men,"Trigger Warning: This is a true story of what I consider normalized violence against women in college towns. The names of women have been changed.

—

Kori and I were going to yet another drunken house party in our Midwest college town. I had other plans, so I stuck around for a few drinks and left her to meet up with a friend. A quick jaunt to a nearby bar to meet Brian and chat over bourbon, which was so popular there in the winter — maybe year round…the place was lush. We mostly talked about my relationship with Kori, about coping with love and jealousy in a hyper-masculine college town. It was clear that our relationship was ending and I needed support and that’s how I coped then.

It was late in a long winter — crisp air, clear skies and fresh snow. I was waiting until Spring to leave her but I sometimes worried about her at night. We were both constantly reckless, which inspired and petrified me, maybe kept the cold out. For whatever reason, that night I took a detour home and stopped by the party to check on her. As I walked up the hill, I saw her head peak, closely escorted by some friends. Relieved to see me, her friends handed her off to me with some heartfelt compliment of chivalry. I chuckled and thought nothing of it.

We headed home holding hands, walking and supporting each other on icy pavements and she seemed relieved to see me.

She barely spoke on that walk.

—

We were a block away from home when she finally spoke up. Her first words were, ‘Promise me you won’t be angry or do anything stupid?” I promised. She paused to find her strength, and I started to sense that the unshakable was shook. Then she told me what had just happened at the house party.

She was dancing in that damp basement when Matt, a white hipster, started hitting on her. To avoid being singled out, she skirted back to the group but he wasn’t having it. Struggling in her voice, she told me how after her rejections he turned sexually violent, grabbing her by the hair, he forced her against the rock walls. Disoriented by the crowds and sounds, she’d barely managed to dig her nails into his neck before another girl rescued her. She’d escaped his grip with a concussion to her head and a few bruises on her limbs, cowering outside as though she’d done some wrong.

She hadn’t done anything wrong.

—

Arriving at the doorstep of our place, I was livid. Staring in the direction of the party, I grew angrier knowing that he was drinking away the night. I’d wanted to return to the party and confront him and our friends. Why was Kori was quietly escorted out? I took out my phone to text Brian now— a former hockey player and bar fighter — before she cut me off, “You promised you wouldn’t!” Half in sobs.

In the gray days that followed, I tried to support Kori. She simply wanted to stay in bed and forget the assault but her nightmares said otherwise. What I’d learned in that time was Matt had a history of sexual violence. Worse, it was open knowledge to everyone but me. In some perverse small town twist, the first night that I met Kori a year ago, was at a party in his apartment. The campus police had broken up another house party so a random group of us scuttled into his nearby studio. Kori and I went home together for the first time that night, and though Matt was vying for her, our friend Camber stayed over. I learned for the first time now that Matt had bloodily beaten Camber, in what was explained as a sexual quirk — entirely non-consensual.

I struggled to understand how Matt was freely roaming our social circles as a fuckboi, with friends of ours falling victim to his violent psyche and others failing to stop him.

I didn’t understand how a guy could be accepted as two actors, a hipster socialite and a violent boy.

—

Unknown to Kori, I’d called up the campus assault hotline. They seemed near dismissive of the incident as though everyday, eventually talking me out of further action. Ultimately, only the victim can press charges, and it usually better to do it immediately. I wondered what would happen to other women in town if Matt wasn’t confronted? I wondered why was he afforded such protections as a young male in an affluent college town?

As a guy, I felt entirely alone and emasculated in my opinion. Kori wasn’t the first, and she wouldn’t be the last. Two days later, I begged her to press charges again, explaining that the campus police would handle the matter. She was furious that I’d suggested it, “What would happen to my reputation if people found out?” She showed a good deal of empathy towards him, “What if they kicked him out of school?”

She never filed a report and it’s unclear if anyone else had either.

—

About a week later, we all ran into each other at another party. There was Matt, Kori, myself, and a group of our friends. Everyone knew what happened, it wasn’t a secret — though no one talked about it. I asked Kori to go inside and she made me promise once again that I wouldn’t make an issue of it, though I’m sure she secretly hoped I would. I stood outside with Matt a while. His friend standing spoke first — he apologized to me for what Matt had done to her.

My blood was hot and my pulse was deafening. As I looked at Matt’s remorseless drunken gaze, imagining the whisperings of his abusive alcoholic Dad. He finally spoke, warm mist shooting out into that cold air, “I’ll let you hit me for what happened.”

She should have shamed him or I should have fucking hit him.

—

I looked around at those young cis het boys as they quietly crowded around us, waiting for something to pass, something to resolve the situation. Then I looked at Kori and her friends through the door screen, staring at all us confused man–children from inside the house.

“Matt, I’m not the one you should be apologizing to. You have a problem and everyone knows it.” Unflinching, Matt begged again as though asking for reconciliation, “I’ll let you hit me right now.” At that moment Kori stepped outside into the heat of that cold exchange.

A Brief Memoir of a Vietnamese-American Girl,"A Brief Memoir of a Vietnamese-American Girl

Growing up Vietnamese-American and learning to not hate that about myself

My parents had their fun with dressing us up.

I am Vietnamese-American, a child of refugees who came to America partially for better opportunities but mostly out of necessity. If you’re interested, you can google Vietnam. You will mainly find war stories and phở recipes and Full Metal Jacket references, but that’s not really who I am.

My dad would criticize how I can’t seem to describe my Vietnamese-ness in words but, frankly, it’s more of a feeling. I’ve been sitting here for half an hour thinking about what being Vietnamese means to me, but I can only think of colors, scents, tastes, and feelings. Congee means recovering from a cold. Tết (the Lunar New Year) means getting along with everyone, because it is bad luck to start the new year in conflict. Vietnam means the distinct smell of tropical fruit and the overwhelming heat that I haven’t forgotten, even after my last visit, six years ago. My Vietnamese upbringing is how my parents raised me, and the feelings that come with that are part bitter, part sweet, but — above all — grateful.

Cultural Dance at the 2014 VSA-UIUC Culture Show. I’m on the far left.

In the past few years, I’ve found myself growing increasingly connected with my ethnicity — the preservation of its culture, the Vietnamese-American experience of all generations, and the issues that affect our community, here and in the motherland. As I grow into my Vietnamese side more and more, I wonder: when did I grow out of it? What happened in between the Vivien in child form, who only spoke and sang in Vietnamese, to the Vivien a few years ago, who struggled to affiliate herself with Vietnamese culture in any way? In my retrospective search for an answer, several memories bubbled to the surface. Here are a few of them.

I am in kindergarten. I cry because I want to be blonde, like Sleeping Beauty, but my mom says it’ll never happen.

I am in first grade. For Halloween, my parents suggest that I go to school as the Moon Goddess, a character in Vietnamese mythology. By the end of the day, I might as well have worn an alien suit, and I look with envy to the witches, the princesses, and the Britney Spears’.

Me as the Moon Goddess. I wore the same headpiece that my mom wore at her wedding.

I am in third grade. I am having a verbal altercation with the boy on the bus home when he says “At least my mom speaks English!” I am furious. When I arrive home in tears and tell my mom what happened, she cries too, not because some snot-nosed kid insulted her, but because I had gotten hurt over who she was.

I am in fourth grade. The Vietnamese food, steaming and mouth-watering at home, is not as well received at school. I ask my mom, for the fifth time, to let me eat the lunch food at school. She asks me why, but how can I tell her that I don’t want to eat her food because of the looks I get at lunchtime? I continue bringing her food to school, oftentimes eating quickly before my friends arrive at the cafeteria table.

Find me at your own risk. Last time I checked, Disney princesses didn’t have bowl cuts.

I am in fifth grade. I was born Vi-Vien Bui, the hyphen indicating the Vietnamese roots of my name (Bui Trang Vi Viên), but Bui becomes “booty,” which becomes “booby.”

I am a freshman in high school. I am doing stretches during gym class when my Chinese classmate says, “You’re pretty… for a Vietnamese girl.”

I am a junior in high school. An Asian girl I’ve never met before comes up to me and says “You look half-white. God, you’re so lucky. I would kill to look part-white.” I don’t look remotely Caucasian, not half, not a quarter, but I thank her because it sounds like a compliment, even if it doesn’t feel like one.

I am a sophomore in college, walking with my friend through his frat house. One of his brothers whispers something about “yellow fever,” loud enough for me to hear. I’m stunned, and I hate that I cry because I’m not sad as much as I am frustrated that it would take too long to explain to drunk frat boys the implications of that and how it feels to be on the receiving end. Later on, I found out that they got high and laughed about it together. I imagine it was an exemplary moment of camaraderie and brotherhood.

Inside a Lion’s head.

I don’t blame anyone for making me wish to be something wholly different than who I am, nor am I bitter about it in the slightest. The other day, my Asian roommate told me she’d do anything to look white. Even though a part of me cringed, I understood the sentiment in a way that was painfully nostalgic. What I do regret is putting my younger self through years of self loathing over something that she couldn’t help or understand at the time.

I want to go back and tell her that she doesn’t need to have high cheekbones and a button nose to be cute, but to hell with cute anyway because she was smart enough and creative enough and kind enough and even if she wasn’t, she was growing into who she is now: someone who is still growing and will not stop growing. I want to tell her that it’s pretty damn cool that she knows how to speak two languages and she can be good at English while also being able to talk to her grandmother past formalities. I want to tell her to eat her mother’s food slowly during lunchtime and to savor it all the time because the college dining halls will not compare. I would tell her about how beautiful the áo dài is and to find all the excuses to be a moon goddess because the Vietnamese folktales are rich and full of history while Britney Spears only dates back to 1981 and the witch costumes weren’t even the least bit scary. I would remind her that her mom is the one who taught her to speak and read in English, and that’s why she was the only one in her kindergarten class who knew how to spell “spaghetti,” a food that was certainly not Vietnamese.

There is the chance that, upon hearing all of this, she wouldn’t believe me— from what I remember, she was stubborn as all hell. So I’d tell her to wait. I’d tell her that eventually she’ll learn these things for herself. Some things will fall into her lap and cause revelations; some things will sink in after years of searching and asking and finding. But she will find, and then she will understand, and then she will want to know more. Wanting to know more, she eventually realizes, will make all the difference.",https://medium.com/endless/a-brief-memoir-of-a-vietnamese-american-girl-8399d04dcdbd,['Vivien Bui'],2015-09-28 21:28:42.650000+00:00,"['Vietnamese', 'Culture', 'Asian American']"

We Need to Talk About Sexual Harassment,"A few days ago, my girlfriend finally took my advice to quit her job. I have always thought it was an obvious decision: She was getting consistent sexual harassment from a married employer.

It was only a few days ago, though, when the inappropriate touchings got out of hand, that she finally decided to quit.

There would be gossips, she said, and she was afraid she would be the one to receive the blame.

Also: He was an old friend she knew from her progressive rock band years.

She was just too sensitive, people would say. People would blame her for making things up. He probably never meant it — wasn’t he a good friend? She was just being dramatic, seeking for attention.

It’s what people always say, she told me. She almost believed it herself.

“Learn to chill out. Be a little more playful. It’s all good fun.”

Except when it isn’t.

That’s the thing about this kind of sexual harassment — it’s never objective. You can always excuse them.

I was the type of kid who would always choose female avatars in my video games. I was the type of unpopular kid who was always alone at recess because everyone else was playing soccer, and I hated soccer. I was the type of teenage boy who was so much more into fashion and dance than football and motorsports.

But, despite all that, I guess I had never really understood

what being a woman means.

Here’s the thing: There is no such thing as objectivity. At least not on a narrative level. The way we do things, the way we give meaning to our experiences — all these are but narrations we tell ourselves about ourselves. And the fact of the matter is that it is always those in power who construct these narratives.

Being a minority — not in number, but in narrative hierarchy— means that there will always be a part of our identity that is denied.

Earlier today, I came across one of the most powerful comic I’ve read in a long time. It will only take two minutes, so I suggest you go ahead and read it for yourself.

Done? Good. Now I will just say this:

All wars do this. All racist attacks have this texture of violence.

And this is precisely what sexual harassment does.

It might be a very dramatic, obvious action, such as rape. Or it might be small things, like staring at someone’s body with obvious sexual intent.

Most are somewhere in between, like uninvited physical touches. Or something verbal, like talking about a woman as a sex object right in her vicinity. Or something online, like the seemingly mandatory YouTube comment about a video host’s pair of breasts.

It can be anything. It varies from person to person, from culture to culture. Everyone constructs the meaning of their existence differently.

Even the “big” and “small”-ness of things is a false objectivity. Things have an exponentially traumatic effect when the assaulter is more trusted and familiar. Like a parent, or an old friend.

It took my girlfriend several disturbing occasions to finally speak up, because she did not want to ruin an old friendship. It was much easier to tell herself that he was only fooling around, and she was being too sensitive.

It’s a sad mistake to look for objectivity in cases of sexual harassment. Some people are okay with risky sex games with multiple partners. Some people have problems with shaking hands with the opposite sex.

You don’t have to agree with them. But wherever you are on the spectrum, there are boundaries you should respect.

It sounds like a terrible cliche, but it’s amazing how many people still don’t seem to get this. It’s amazing how many people still blame the victim for being a pussy, or an attention-seeking prude, or a slut that deserved it when the shit finally hits the fan.

It sounds like a cliche, but think about this: Every time you overstep that boundary, you tear apart and step all over that person’s construction of meaning about themselves.

Sometimes, the feeling lasts just for few ugly hours, and they are lucky enough to be able to talk to supportive loved ones, and they can speak up and get over it.

Sometimes it lasts a few horrific weeks, and they develop lifetime strong, classist, racist feelings against a certain group (e.g. the proverbial construction workers) to recover their self-worth. Terrible, but if that’s how they get over it, then that’s how they get over it.

Other times, when the degree is traumatic enough, they become so torn that they make breakfast for their rapists and stopped wanting to be beautiful for the rest of their lives.

I don’t want to underplay rape. But we should also not forget the seemingly more innocent, never-justifiable-in-court forms of sexual harassment that happens all around us, every day.

Think about this: Every time you tell a person that it’s her own fault of dressing too sexily, or that it’s her own fault of not being able to take a joke, you are chipping away at the person’s self-worth. You are telling her that, all this time, her belief in herself and the things that matter to her has been wrong, inferior.

Every time you say those things, you are helping to perpetuate a society in which it is okay to have unbalanced power structures, in which the majority has all the rights to infringe upon the minority’s self-worth and identity construction. And what are those if not fundamental rights of every person?

Assault is bad. But it’s not just about the assaulters. It’s also so much about the way we talk about these things.

So, the next time your friend tells you how a certain person or group makes her sexually uncomfortable, please stop trying to find out the objective facts of what exactly happened and judge accordingly. In fact, just stop whatever you’re doing and give her a hug. She probably needs it.

And the next time you make another person feel uncomfortable, even if she did not explicitly say it, perhaps you could think about apologizing. Explain to her that you didn’t mean it, even if — yes — for one second you might have meant it. There is always a chance to be a better person.

If you have felt these icky feelings yourself, speak up. Find someone you can trust. Comment on this article and maybe find some online support.

There is no objectivity for these things.

No court of law to decide what’s fair and what isn’t.

So let us all listen. And tell good stories. And give hugs.

It’s not just about being a good friend. It’s about creating that space in society where unsayable fears can be acknowledged.

The Life-Affirming Power of the Jewish Funeral,"Modern Judaism is unique in its views on the afterlife, because it practically has none. No heavenly rewards are promised for worldly virtue, nor is Hell threatened for sinners. In fact, it is the rare American Jew who can even name the place the Torah says people go when they die. So it is a bit of a mystery that Jewish funerals receive the elaborate treatment and importance they are accorded in Judaism.

How, when most funerals emphasize the passage of the spirit to the afterlife, can a religion with almost no afterlife deal with death?

Above all, Jewish funerals aim to honor the deceased. The burial of the dead is considered one of the highest obligations of Judaism. In the days of the Temple, even the high priest — who was normally prohibited from touching corpses — was obligated to bury the deserted dead.

The Jewish way of dealing with death is characterized by a head-on confrontation with the reality of death.

Embalming and adorning the body is forbidden, as it makes a mockery of God’s gift of life, and it represents a sort of self-deception. The Jewish metaphor for death is “dust to dust.”

As opposed to American Christian funerals, where the actual burial occurs only after the service is concluded and the mourners have left, Jewish mourners physically bury their own dead. The principal mourners place the first shovelfuls of earth into the grave, symbolizing their full acceptance of the deceased’s separation from the world.

In Jewish funerals, the hollow percussion of the dirt hitting the coffin marks the finality of death. As Maurice Lamm so aptly puts it in his book The Jewish Way in Death and Mourning:

Psychologically, the heart-rending thud of earth on the casket is enormously beneficial. In proclaiming finality, it helps the mourner overcome the illusion that his relative still lives; it answers his disbelief that death has indeed claimed its victim; it quiets his lingering doubts that this may be only a bad dream. The earth-filling process dispels such illusions and starts the mourner on the way to recovery and reconciliation.

The recessional away from the graveside serves to further direct the attention to the mourners. The mourners walk between two parallel lines of family and friends, who formally comfort them. After the recessional, everyone involved washes their hands. This symbolizes that, while the dead are respected, they are not worshiped. It also metaphorically removes the last traces of death from the community. The focus now is on the living.",https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/the-life-affirming-power-of-the-jewish-funeral-f1444bba9013,['Mirah Curzer'],2015-12-12 01:31:16.587000+00:00,"['Judaism', 'Religion', 'Death']"
6 ways to tell you’re truly in love,"Our totally legit love guru Sweta Rana has been inspired by the relationship advice found in women’s magazines. But how can you really tell that you’ve found the one?

If there are no flowers and chocolates, it’s probably not true love. Photo: Shenghung Lin/Flickr

Hello, ladies! Got yourself a man, but not sure whether it’s the real thing? Here’s how to tell…

1. He’s constantly on your mind

If you’re thinking about him all the time, it’s a sure sign of real commitment. Think about him at home, and at work, and in between? It’s clear this guy’s gotten into your head, and your heart! In fact, if there is a single split-second during your life when you’re not thinking about him, for example if you’re asleep or concussed or distracted by a ravaging, deathly disease, then it means you’re not in love, you never will be and you should definitely break up with him right away so you can go rot alone in a cave somewhere.

2. You have the same star sign

Specialised research has shown that if you share the same star sign, you are cosmically destined to fall in love and have several babies. In a professional study*, a whopping 20% were found to have the same star sign as their significant other. If your stars are aligned, he must be on your mind!

*survey of 5 participants

3. You’re not quite sure what his name is

Are you unsure as to what this guy is actually called? Hello, wedding bells! Your connection is so deep, trivial things like his name, birthday and personality are secondary to your passionate love. After all, a name’s just some nonsensical squiggles on a birth certificate, right ladies? If you’re distracted by silly things like what he’s called or where he works, you might want to take a long hard look at your priorities. Love first — boring facts and statistics later!

4. You fake your orgasms to end sex faster

Pretending to reach orgasm just so he’ll hurry up and finish is one of the kindest, most loving gestures you can make. You care so much about his beauty sleep that you’re willing to end sex as early as possible so he can get a good night’s rest. If you’ve ever faked an orgasm with your man, even just once, then congratulations — you two are on the crossroads between Love Boulevard and Commitment Lane! Next stop, Forever City!

5. You’ve cooked him a meal

After your Manly Man returns home from work, where he probably does Manly things like chop wood and punch strangers, he flops down on the sofa still wearing his Manly suit, watches some Manly sport and thinks about making a Manly dinner. If you’ve ever provided this meal for him — bless you, going all Nigella for your fella! Research has proved that literally no woman ever cooks unless it’s for a man, and we are biologically designed to not actually know what cooking is until we fall in love with one. Tip: the best technique is to present a live baby deer before him, tied up and terrified, so he can have the Manly pleasure of killing his own food.

6. You don’t believe you love him

Scientists have shown that stage one of any process in the entire world, whether it be grief, love, photosynthesis or global warming, is always denial. It’s human nature: you just don’t want to believe what’s happening to you. So, do you look at this guy and feel nothing? Do you imagine your future with him and begin compulsively vomiting in fearful disgust? Have you considered hiring an ancient army of ninjas to dispense with him altogether? Official research has proved that all of these feelings are 99% likely to be your subconscious denial of true love, and the other 1% was just like a typo or something anyway. Not loving someone is the crucial first step to loving them.

Why do so many women’s magazines do this? Why do they take the overwhelming, terrifying, beautiful complexities of life and reduce them into simplistic patronisations? Why do they assume that everyone’s sexual needs are the same, that love and sex are only understood heteronormatively, that being single is temporary at best and pseudo-supernatural at worst? These features always seem to encourage a woman to adapt themselves to a man, in ways based on ancient stereotype. It’s utterly disheartening.

But it’s also stupid. Terrifically, terrifically stupid. The nonsense above isn’t hugely different from what you’ll discover in Cosmo or Bustle. It’s so exaggerative it barely holds together. It’s so utterly absurd you just have to laugh at it.

So while these things are still floating around, join me in mocking them mercilessly. They are condescending, assumptive gibberish.

Close Encounters With An Abercrombie & Fitch Catalog,"When I was eleven, I shared a toilet seat in the woods with ten boys. Summer camp, near the Pine Barrens in New Jersey. A cabin with plumbing. I had a few Goosebumps books. Noah had four geodes. Eli had five decks of Magic: The Gathering cards. Adam had an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog.

It was an Abercrombie & Fitch Quarterly, actually — a retail catalog-cum-magazine, or “maglog” as they say in the biz. Twenty percent merch, twenty percent talk, and one hundred percent soft-core aspirational porn. Playboy crossed with Fratmen.com and a bit of Field & Stream. A four-page interview with Jenna Jameson next to highly saturated photos of an America that had forgotten its flannel-lined chinos and moose boxers but had gone on the camping trip anyway.

Adam kept it in a particleboard cubby, under a few Ren & Stimpy briefs. He’d just graduated fifth grade, and the first thing he said to us as we were unpacking was, “Hey, so, I’m gay, you guys.” He had a middle-part bowl cut and a bunch of oversized orange tee shirts from Aeropostale. One night, after we licked the crystals from jumbo salted pretzel sticks — snack, nightly, at 8:30 — Adam invited us to his bottom bunk. We gripped our Maglites and ran our fingers over thick layers of deltoid-shaped soy ink.

Two naked men were wearing moose hats in a nature preserve. The sun was slanting through the trees, dappling their quadriceps.

A decade after the Pine Barrens, I found a copy of the Quarterly in the apartment of the first guy I dated. This was a few years ago, in my mid-twenties. I’d just come out. Or, I hadn’t come out as much as melted myself into a puddle and slipped through the crack under the door, like liquid mercury. I didn’t tell a bunch of people I probably should have told.

I flipped through the catalog on the floor of his apartment, thinking of Adam’s Ren & Stimpy-briefs panache, his Aeropostale-swaddled candor. I’m the type that fumbles sentences during coffee with strangers. I aim to please. I’ll go for the white lie, or the hot pink lie, or the polka-dotted feather-hatted lie if someone is staring me in the face and asking me to take their side. In Kindergarten, someone tore down the alphabet poster and our teacher lined us up, execution-style, to ask each of us if we’d done it. I hadn’t, but I really wanted to say I had — and then nail the alphabet poster to the door like Martin Luther, maybe — just to make my everyone’s lives a little easier.

And so, Abercrombie. The Quarterly made my hormones do a kick line across my frontal lobe. I wanted to nibble the soy ink for snack until sunrise. To absorb it so deeply I sweat grey drops onto my pillow. To rip a page from that issue and fold it into a paper flower and stick it all the way up my ass until it came out my mouth.

Something I’ve learned about bravery is it takes just as much to say the obvious, banal, trite and true thing as it does to say what’s unique and rare. Accepting yourself is hard. Abercrombie can help.

“Hot Jesus, you know it’s all Photoshopped by these people in, like, L.A.”

That was Noah, with an amethyst geode in one hand and a pretzel stick in the other. It was almost lights-out. There were fireflies outside, shining their little butt lights all over New Jersey.

We’d wake up the next morning to fight a color war, and we’d lose. Our parents would pick us up in their duck-colored Suburbans and drive us out of the woods, toward puberty and caffeine headaches and sitting on the floor of a boyfriend’s apartment flipping through his Abercrombie catalogs. What if I knew that one day, in a decade and change, I’d be almost as confident as old tween Adam about who I was and what I wanted? If our Magic cards were actually magic, and a quicksilver amulet could have spun me out into now and back. Have you ever felt your entire past ripple through your hippocampus at once? What about your future?

“Duuhhhh, that’s the fucking point,” Adam said.

The Quarterly was discontinued in 2003, after the American Decency Association boycotted photos of doe-eyed bare-assed jocks in prairies and glens. Before that, though, there were four eleven-year-olds in the woods. Their retinas were absorbing the light reflected from images of glutes and leaves.

Customer Support is a Profit Center,"It’s easy for some people to discard the value of customer support and tell themselves that it is a cost center which is something you should outsource.

We already spent a substantial amount of time and money on development, why not save any cost possible attached to the delivery of the product?

The fact that customers are having issues can easily be problems on their end and we don’t want to be their local IT support staff.

Do you remember the last time you had a problem with your internet connection and you had to get on the phone with your service provider? Was that experience any good? (if it was, then you’re probably a loyal customer of their’s somewhat because of their support, no?)

If you’re a customer, you should be able to talk to the company you’re doing business with. Paul English, founder of Kayak.com

Customer Support directly influence your brand

Branding and marketing has become so much more about the entire experience with your product and your company, and not just an afterthought of advertising on top.

With any contact your customer has with your product or brand, the brand either increase or decrease in value from the perspective of the customer.

Why not make any experience with your brand as great as possible, so that you add value to your brand every time?

The circles of marketing

Most amateurs and citizens believe that marketing is the outer circle. Marketing = advertising, it seems. The job of marketing in this circle is to take what the factory/system/boss gives you and hype it, promote it and yell about it. This is what so many charities, politicians, insurance companies, financial advisors, computer makers and well, just about everyone does. Seth Godin — The circles of marketing

The above quote from the blog post by Seth Godin is accompanied with the photo on the left and also a downloadable PDF.

As customer support adds value to your brand, it also helps to think about customers as people you can influence and turn into evangelists. People go crazy when they get more than they expected. Every day we see evidence on the internet of companies winning big by going the extra mile.

That was basically the building block of Zappos, who was sold to Amazon for a substantial price tag.

My favorite example by far is LEGO who scoured their warehouses for the discontinued Emerald Night Train an 11-year-old boy had spent two years saving up his money to buy, only to discover it is now an expensive collectible that is not being manufactured anymore.

It arrived at their door step two days before his birthday. Priceless marketing.

Seth Godin ends the blog post with the following sentence:

When in doubt, when your marketing isn’t working, the answer is easy: go one circle in.

Insights for product and growth

I believe that we can never know too much about our customers, and very few actually know enough to clearly articulate their product decisions. Talking directly to customers should be a top priority, even after you feel successful and have become profitable (from day one?).

Treating customer support as part of both your product and your product design team can help you continually learn about their day-to-day jobs and learn about their struggles and enable you to align your product according to this validated learning.

Paul English, founder of Kayak.com, was frustrated with engineers not sharing empathy with customer issues when he explained it to them.

So he thought that exposing engineers directly to the customer would increase their empathy, and get the issue solved more effectively.

Career path to engineering

Hiring engineers will always be a challenge. So why not establish a clear path to engineering within your company?

Support staff who could potentially become engineers would early on show interest in how the engineers solved bugs reported by customers.

That slowly grows, and they’ll suddenly start doing initial research into the bugs. Is it a client side issue? Open up DevTools in Chrome and have a go at troubleshooting.

Someone doing customer support, is now doing a little bit of testing. The more they do that, they more interest they show in the subject the more they might want to change their job into that of a member of the QA team.

From there, it shouldn’t be discouraged to grow further into engineering.

How much does it cost to hire an engineer in a competitive market?

With direct cost of advertising the position, teaming up with a recruiting agency, getting paper work done, doing interviews, travel expenses but also indirect cost of on-boarding a new person, peers spending time to help that person get up to speed — the cost could go well over $50k and even approach $100k.

Conclusion

It might be totally obvious to you that customer support is a central part of a product team. It might also be totally obvious that the user experience of your product goes beyond the actual app on their phone or in their browser.

What is often forgotten is the hidden cost in lack of the above that invisibly ramps up the cost of going with what seamed like a cheap option.",https://medium.com/product-hacking/customer-support-is-a-profit-center-b47d60ffaae1,['Martin H.

The recipe for these muffins came from her church recipe collection from 1972.

The recipe itself is for Nut Bread, but the 3 bananas qualify it as banana bread. I didn’t include the nuts for my allergic friends, plus I’m slightly put off by the strawberry-nut combo.

This was my first time making jam, and I really had fun with it! I used lemon juice to help break the strawberries down, and added a few spices and sugar. It was pretty easy, and very rewarding. I feel like I have achieved even further grandma-status now that I can make jam (check that one off my list). I loved the final product, and that is saying something, seeing as I’m one of those people who never puts the J in PB&J.

As for the muffin component, they are super easy and pretty foolproof. There’s nothing like bananas and a ton of cinnamon to make a muffin moist and delicious.

And the fancy-looking heart part… I literally took a knife to the muffin and cut a heart out. Yep. That’s it. I hollowed the heart-shaped holes out a tiny bit to make room for the jam, spooned it in, and I was done! I am not an artist- if I can make the heart shapes, so can you.

Banana Bread Strawberry Jam Muffins

Makes: 1 dozen (1 hr)

Ingredients: For the jam: 1 package of strawberries, 1 tbsp cornstarch, 3 tbsp sugar, 1/2 tbsp cinnamon, sprinkle of nutmeg, juice of 1/2 lemon, 1 tsp vanilla For the muffins: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 cup packed dark brown sugar, 1/2 cup canola or other vegetable oil, 3 ripe bananas (mashed), 2 eggs (beaten), 1/2 tsp vanilla, 3 tbsp milk 1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and grease a muffin pan. Set aside. To make the jam: 2. Cut strawberries into small pieces and begin to cook in small pot on medium-low. 3.

I Defaulted on My Student Loans. Here’s What I Did to Get Back on Track,"by Anna Moreno

When I began taking out student loans for university, I had a fool-proof five-year plan for paying them off. I was going to go to graduate school, become an elementary school teacher, work in a high-needs public school for five years, and have the rest of my federal debt forgiven. Simple. If I stuck with the plan, I didn’t need to worry about those loans at all.

Of course, life didn’t go as smoothly as I had envisioned as an 18-year-old. This became glaringly apparent 10 years later, when I received an email from the HR department at my company:

Attached is a copy of a Wage Garnishment Order filed by the U.S. Department of Education. We are commanded to immediately remit 15% of your disposable pay to the U.S. Department of Education each pay period. Deductions will begin on your next paycheck. We cannot reduce, amend or discontinue the deduction without written authorization from the U.S. Department of Education. Please contact our office should you have questions or require additional information. Thank you.

I have a confession to make. I’ve defaulted on my student loans. I know I’m not alone in this. But here we are. We all have our reasons for being in this situation. It’s not a shameful or embarrassing position to be in. It just is. And, as I’ve recently learned, we have options if we aren’t afraid to pursue them.

I never intended to default on my student loans. Like I said, I had a plan. After graduation, I spent a few years teaching English abroad and paid my student loans every month without fail. When that job finished, I moved to New York for graduate school and deferred my loans while studying for my master’s degree in education. But then a funny thing happened. I decided that I didn’t want to be a teacher anymore. I had no idea what I wanted to do career-wise — I had some vague idea of doing something in book publishing — but other than that, I was at a loss. I was also broke and about $20,000 in debt to the U.S. Department of Education.

I funded all of my college and graduate school living expenses on my own by waiting tables. So, while I tried to figure out what career I wanted to pursue, I went back to serving to pay the rent. Although being a server in New York City can be wildly lucrative at the right establishments, I was working at the kind of restaurant where breaking $100 during a weekend shift was considered good money, and a “raise” meant helping ourselves to as much beer as we could handle without getting caught by the manager. Between paying for both my rent and living expenses, and saving a little bit of cash for going out, it felt like I had nothing left over for my student loan payments.

Fortunately, I had a six-month grace period before I had to start repaying my loans after graduating and I was confident something would turn up. But six months later, the only career-related job I’d found was an unpaid internship at a small literary agency. My income came entirely from the tips I made waiting tables. It was barely enough to cover all of my expenses and instead of setting up a repayment schedule or requesting a financial hardship forbearance, I decided I would much rather just stop thinking about my loans. I knew that the minute I earned more money, I’d start making the monthly payments again, so what was the point in dealing with all that bureaucracy?

At first, it was easy to not think about my loans. I have a hate-hate relationship with debt. I won’t buy things I can’t afford to pay for entirely up front. I don’t have credit cards. I have no personal or consumer debt, so it was easy to ignore my one and only source of debt. My creditors would send bills each month, and I would throw the envelopes away without opening them. Not paying my loans didn’t seem to have any effect on my life at that exact moment. I was sure my credit was ruined, but I had a long-term lease and eschewing credit cards and other forms of personal debt meant I didn’t care much about my credit score. And I still believed that my non-payment was just a temporary blip. I was certain I’d start to pay my loans off soon. I had faith something would turn up.

One year into default I started getting phone calls from strange numbers. I knew it was probably my student loan lenders. I thought maybe I should pick up the phone and deal with the financial mess I’d made, but every time I thought about it, I told myself I’d do it tomorrow. The truth was, I was scared. I couldn’t face how big my debt might have gotten. I worried that the collection agents would berate me for being so irresponsible. I didn’t know how to even begin to explain myself or have the conversations that I needed to have to find a solution to my problems. I was afraid that I’d screwed things up so badly that there was no way to fix it. I didn’t even have the money to start paying $100 a month, so what was the point? It all seemed so impossibly difficult. Continuing on in default seemed like the only option for me. My phone rang with increasing frequency. I started screening my incoming calls and would only answer when I knew who the caller was. It was annoying, but I could live with it.

I started working at a better restaurant and even with a 25 percent increase in the tips I made, I didn’t view the extra money I earned as money that could go towards paying off my student loans. For the first time in my adult life, I felt more or less financially comfortable, and I wasn’t willing to go back to scrimping and saving. No more instant ramen dinners, Forever 21 jeans and boxed hair dye for me. I deserved a little luxury in my life. I used my newfound wealth to go on a long-deferred vacation, to buy a new mattress, to try that amazing restaurant I couldn’t afford to visit before. After all, I’d been ignoring my loans for so long and there hadn’t been any negative consequences so far. What was another year or two?

Sometimes, I started to feel panicked about my loan situation. I would dream up all sorts of get-rich-quick schemes. I’d win the lottery or write the next blockbuster YA novel. I looked into becoming a dominatrix at foot fetish parties. I tried out for the game show “Who Wants to be a Millionaire.”

I finally found a full-time 9-to-5 job with benefits, although the salary was just about what I made waiting tables. And still, I ignored my student loans, living as thought I was completely debt-free. I knew that this was a mistake. But by then, five years into default, it seemed too late to remedy the situation. And then came the email from HR.

When the government garnishes your wages to repay your student loan debt, they are allowed to take 15 percent of your post-tax salary — or 25 percent if you owe student loans to two different creditors — and send it to the collection agency. The money first goes to pay collection costs and fees, and then when that has been paid off, towards the principal balance and interest. For some reason, I didn’t view wage garnishment as a big deal. I was thrilled that I wouldn’t have to remember to pay my loans every month; the government was basically doing all of the work for me. Around $500 a month was withheld from my paycheck to repay my loans, a rate much higher than if I had been repaying my loans on an income-contingent repayment plan. Even after garnishment, I was taking home about $450 a week, which I could live on in NYC if I were frugal. This seemed like a win-win situation, as long as I didn’t worry too much about my credit score. I still had no idea how much exactly I owed, or to whom, but since all of my loans were federal loans, I figured the money would eventually make it to the right people and everything would be paid off in five or six years at most.

I had read online that there were options for people in default. The first option was to rehabilitate my loans, which requires borrowers in default to make voluntary, on-time payments based on income vs. expenses for nine out of 10 consecutive months. Once a borrower has successfully done so, the loans come out of default, wage garnishment is stopped, and borrowers are eligible for the same benefits available for the loan before default.

In addition, rehabilitating a student loan will restore your credit, and collection costs for the loans forgiven. The other option was loan consolidation. This involves making voluntary on-time payments based on income vs. expenses for two to four consecutive months. While this option is faster, credit will not be restored and you will still owe the collections fees that can increase your debt by up to 25 percent. With both options, borrowers pay a fee of up to 18.5 percent of the total debt to the collection agencies, which is added to the principal balance after the loans have come out of default. I’d thought about rehabbing my loans, but I managed to talk myself out of it every time. The voluntary fees would probably be too high for me to afford. Setting up the rehabilitation plan would be too time-consuming. Would I have to call up all three collection agencies and negotiate a new deal with each one? What if the agencies treat me like an idiot? What if they can’t help me at all? Wouldn’t it be easier to just go on in default for years until it’s paid off, even if I have to live a hand-to-mouth existence until then? It was all just too complicated.

However, after two years of wage garnishment and generally avoiding the reality that I did, in fact, owe a substantial amount of money to the government, I decided to get my act together: No more stupid excuses. I was going to take responsibility for my poor financial decisions and get out of default. I only had myself to blame for getting into this mess. No one was going to fix it for me. It was up to me to fix it on my own.

The hardest part was making that first phone call. I went to Washington Square Park on a sunny afternoon, mentally preparing myself. You can do this. The Department of Education is here to help you. You have options. Don’t be a punk. Make the call.

I first called the U.S. Department of Education’s Debt Collection Service Information Center, whose number was listed on my wage garnishment order. The woman on the line was perfectly pleasant, but told me that I would have to speak directly with the three collection agencies that currently held my loans to discuss my options. To my surprise, even though I had only taken out federal loans, that did not automatically mean the collection agencies in charge of recouping those debts were the same. My loans had been sold off to different agencies based on the type of loan I had taken out and which school I had been attending when I took out the loans. She gave me the numbers for the three agencies that were in charge of collecting my federal student debt and what I currently owed for each loan. For the first time in years I knew the exact amount of my student loan debt. It wasn’t as bad as I thought. I still owed more or less what I owed before I had gone into default: $20,000. Even though almost $10,000 had been withheld from my salary during the last two years, the interest and collection costs that had accrued over the eight years I was either in deferment or default had caused the size of my debt to increase by almost 50 percent. But, it was a massive relief to finally, finally know where I stood. The woman also told me that all of this information was available online at the National Student Loan Data System of Students where borrowers can view all of their federal debt and get information regarding which agencies currently hold that debt.

Before I had a chance to change my mind, I called up the first collection agency on the list. I wasn’t sure why I was so nervous, but I was. I explained why I was calling to the operator, who passed me on to the correct department. I was only put on hold for about 10 minutes — not even long enough for me to change my mind about continuing on with the whole process. I took the quick hold time as a sign that everything was going to be all right.

My case manager, Sharon, introduced herself. She sounded a little young, but positive and cheerful. I explained the situation as best I could, and said that I wanted to try to rehabilitate my loans. I don’t know if I sounded worried or not, but Sharon was a reassuring presence. She told me that many people found themselves in default, that my situation wasn’t unusual and that the reasons why didn’t matter as much as our desire to get ourselves out of it. She told me that she was there to assist me in any way she could. We would work together to remove my loans from default.

Sharon informed me of the two options available to me: rehabilitation or consolidation. Because my wages were being garnished, the voluntary payments would be in addition to what was already being deducted from my paycheck. Since my take-home salary after taxes and garnishment was low, my voluntary payments would only be $100 per month. If I hadn’t allowed things to get to the point where my wages were being garnished, voluntary payments that both myself and the collection agency agreed were “reasonable and affordable” would have been calculated based on how much how large my debt was, family size, and how much money I made on a monthly basis once expenses have been taken into account. There is no one-size-fits-all percentage to determine voluntary payments — it depends on a variety of factors unique to the individual borrower, and it is open to negotiation if you feel the amount that the agency believes you can pay is too high. Since I couldn’t afford to pay an extra $100 each month for nine months, I chose to consolidate my loans. I knew consolidation meant a death sentence for my credit score, but financially, I didn’t have a choice.

When you consolidate your federal loans to get out of default, you apply to the William D. Ford Direct Loan Consolidation Program. This program is run by the U.S. Department of Education and only consolidates federal loans. Because this program is run by the government, the interest rates are much lower than consolidating with a private company and your federally consolidated loan is eligible for many benefits that consolidation via private companies can’t provide, such as the ability to apply for a financial hardship forbearance or to defer your loans should you go back to school. Although most borrowers who consolidate with this program have many repayment options, if you are trying to get out of default, you must use the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, which calculates monthly payments based on your income, family size, and the total amount of your loans. The Department of Education provides a calculator to help borrowers estimate their payments under this plan, and I found that my monthly student loan payments would drop to half of what was currently being garnished from my wages.

Sharon carefully explained the process for consolidating my loans, the benefits of getting out of default, and informed me of the two most important aspects of rehabilitation via consolidation. I had assumed the most important thing I could do was make those on-time, voluntary payments. However, equally important was completing the paperwork quickly and correctly.

The time it takes to consolidate your loans and get out of default varies depending on how quickly the Department of Education processes your paperwork. If there are any mistakes, you have to resubmit your paperwork and start the process over. Different departments within the Department of Education work at different speeds, so the separate parts of your consolidation application may be processed at different times. If the paperwork is submitted and approved immediately, those voluntary payments may only last for two months before the loans are consolidated and considered out of default. However, if there are problems or if you take a long time to return the paperwork, the entire process can take three or four months, and you must keep making voluntary payments until consolidation is approved. If you miss a month, then you must start the whole process over from the beginning. Plus, you can only get your loans out of default through rehabilitation or rehabilitation via consolidation once. If you default again, you are not eligible to rehabilitate them a second time. Essentially, you are dealt one, and only one, get-out-of-jail-free card.

The following day, Sharon called me and we filled out the application together, page by page, to ensure that the consolidation application was completed correctly. All of my federal loans, including loans that were being handled by different agencies, were added to the consolidation application so that I only had to deal with one agency to get out of default entirely. Throughout it all, Sharon knowledgeably answered my questions about the parts of the application that were unclear, as well as any further questions I had about the process in general. Whatever worries I had, she quickly alleviated. Most importantly, she never made me feel like an irresponsible loser for making such obviously stupid decisions about my student loans. These things can happen to anyone, she reassured me. All that matters is that you are taking charge of the situation now. I believed her.

The key to successfully completing this entire process is communication. Sharon contacted me to confirm that my paperwork had been received and sent on to the Department of Education for review. We set up a time to speak once a week to discuss what progress had been made with the application. Part of Sharon’s job is to continually follow up with the Department of Education with regards to my case. In our weekly phone calls, even if no real progress has been made, she keeps me apprised of how everything is going. I’m only three weeks into the consolidation process, so in the next month or two I can probably expect to speak with Sharon two or three times a week. For the first time in years, I’m not screening my calls. I’m not afraid to pick up the phone. It’s a wonderful feeling.

I don’t know how all of this will turn out. Maybe getting out of default will take much longer than expected. Maybe one of my loans won’t be eligible for consolidation. Maybe this process will be a lot harder than it seems. I know I only have myself to blame for getting myself into this mess. I’m proud of myself for taking that first step. Making the first call was the hardest part. But once I got past that hurdle, the task at hand didn’t seem quite so daunting. All of the excuses I made for not dealing with my student debt earlier now seem ridiculous.

I know everyone in this situation has a different set of obstacles to overcome before they can consider rehabilitating their student loans. You might have private loans, which may be harder to rehabilitate. You might not have the financial ability to make the monthly voluntary payments. Perhaps you have family commitments that take precedence over dealing with the rehabilitation process. But for me, getting my loans out of default wasn’t as impossible or as terrifying as I had imagined. So far, it hasn’t been that bad at all. I don’t know what I was so afraid of.

I’m only halfway through this process. But: This experience has taught me that we — myself and the roughly 6.8 million student borrowers who have found themselves in default — have options. All we have to do is make a decision to do something about it, and then, simply pick up the phone.

How I Growth-Hacked My Age In One Year,"How I Growth-Hacked My Age In One Year

And you can too!

As a fan of startup culture, I’ve been reading a lot about growth hacking.

For those of you who don’t know, “growth hacking” is a strategy a lot of startups use to get their name out, grow their customer base, etc, all without having to spend tons of money on advertising or expensive PR firms.

But growth hacking isn’t just for startups. Any one of us can “growth hack” aspects of our personal lives, too: Like getting more people to join your book club, or increasing the number of readers on your blog.

In my case, I personally used this strategy to grow my age by a whole year, all within the short span of the last 12 months.

At left: 29, At right: 30. Results: A whopping 3.3% increase in age.

Here’s How I Did It

I breathed a lot. I found it crucial to inhale and exhale every few seconds, so as to keep my aging on pace with growth expectations.

I found it crucial to inhale and exhale every few seconds, so as to keep my aging on pace with growth expectations. My body performed basic biological functions. To help with this, I consumed food and water, slept, and exercised from time to time.

To help with this, I consumed food and water, slept, and exercised from time to time. I avoided standing directly under loose wrecking balls. As tempting as it is to stand beneath a 1500-lb wrecking ball that is clearly about to snap from its chain, I chose not to. It’s important to weed out things that might get in the way of whatever you’re trying to “growth hack.”

The Noise and the Signal. Soundwave has around 1.5 million…,"ALARMING

WE’RE NOT SCAREMONGERING — THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING!

Of course, it’s impossible to monitor dashboards constantly — at least if you want to get some useful work done. This is where alarms come in. At its most basic, an alarm triggers some action when some metrics has broken some bounds for some period of time. In reality, this can reflect something minor like a temporary blip in network connectivity, or the death of some vital application function. Understanding the difference, and alarming on such is an art in itself, one that it’s important to master. If your system is too sensitive, alarming on everything, then consumers of those alarms quickly become desensitised to them, ignoring the truly valuable ones. If there are no alarms, or the wrong alarms, adventures like our MongoDB one can be seen much more often than the black swan. Thinking of alarms as signals that represent app function is useful in defining their importance. For example, Play Processing Down is an alarm that directly aligns with app function. The key decision here is if this requires the immediate attention of an engineer and if so, to page or to email.

Some differing types of alarms

Alarming at just the right amount of fidelity is doubly important when your app needs to be up 24/7. Pages that wake up engineers at 2am subtract all the following days’ productivity from that engineer. Enough of those in a period and your engineering team turn into zombies that really do want to kill you. Considering the example alarm Timeline Feed is unacceptably slow. This has a tendency to happen around once every two weeks, around when the DB is busy processing overnight reports. Almost all of the time, it is explained by the load on the database and is temporary. Most of the time, this alarm was no longer triggered by the time an engineer came to intervene. Therefore, having alarm trigger kick off overnight was pointless. We are prepared to accept the chance of a minor loss of user experience for the sake of our engineers productivity. In fact that energy is better spent on fixing the root cause of this problem at source.

Just the right amount of alarming at just the right severity level is a tricky number to converge on. It may change over time and requires good judgement to nail. Quantifying alarms in terms of application function and framing it in terms of user impact, and engineer impact can make it easier to find the sweet spot.",https://medium.com/soundwave-stories/the-noise-and-the-signal-metrics-monitoring-and-alarming-at-soundwave-c544d2527e75,['David Lynch'],2015-03-02 19:41:28.780000+00:00,"['Devop', 'Metrics', 'Monitoring']"
What Two Teenagers Learned From Watching Every Best Picture Oscar Winner,"In the past 18 months, two teenage sisters in North Carolina watched a LOT of movies.

Cecilia (16) and Julie (15) Pitts set out to watch all 87 films that won an Oscar for Best Picture as well as every movie on the AFI’s 100 Years…100 Movies list.

Here’s what they had to say about the filmmakers, actors, and movies they watched:

The Filmmakers That Made An Impression On Them

Alfred Hitchcock

Director Alfred Hitchcock during production of The Birds (1963)

“I don't think I had seen any of his movies. But now I think he is amazing at what he does. I consider him to be the best of that kind of film style.” — CP

Stanley Kubrick

“You can tell he has this thing for strange stories. A Clockwork Orange was great and I just like the whole milk room scene…that’s a great shot. I love the part where he’s singing while he’s in the tub.

“And 2001: A Space Odyssey. Oh man, the baby in space! And the scene where he goes to that room that is almost like a plain room and then he sees his old self. It’s like, ‘Whoa!’

“I also liked the whole beginning intro with the ape grabbing the bone. It’s like symbolizing a new start of something — and then the bone going in the air. I had seen that in other things before, but I had never really known where it came from. It was cool seeing that from the original thing.” — JP

The Actors That Caught Their Eye

Meryl Streep

“I just think she gets so into character and she does everything just amazingly. She was great in Kramer vs. Kramer and The Deer Hunter. I can't decide which one I liked more. She’s become my favorite actress.” — CP

Dustin Hoffman

“I liked him, but I hadn't really heard of him. But then I saw him in Rain Man, Marathon Man and The Graduate. He acted so good. I also saw him in Midnight Cowboy where he was like, ‘Hey, I'm walking here!’ and I'm like, ‘So that’s where it came from!’” — JP

Vivien Leigh

“I loved how she portrayed the character in A Streetcar Named Desire. I felt she was kind of alright, but you knew she was insane, kind of losing it. Then at the end, all of what you had been thinking, it was confirmed and then you just saw her like: boom, she’s crazy.” — JP

The Movies That Stuck With Them

Sylvester Stallone in Rocky (1976).

Rocky

“This is my favorite movie of all. Its simple story pulled me in from the opening scene. What is amazing is I felt as if it could really happen. It’s like Marty except he is an underdog, you love him, you want him to be in love. The underdog story at its finest.” — CP

“The characters were all likable, even Paulie was harmless. Something that stood out was the music by Bill Conti. We watched the films out of order, but it appears to be the first real use of workout montages, and the music is perfect in those scenes. Rocky was not a really good boxer, but he had heart and just wanted to go the distance. In the end it was more important for him to win the girl, Adrian. They were one of my favorite couples. They were so shy. It was cute.” — JP

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid

“Everything is just great in the beginning, everyone is happy, funny scenes (like when Butch fights that giant man). A nice musical interlude with ‘Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head’ (which I had never heard) but then everything, I would say, hilariously, goes wrong.

“The pairing of these two was amazing. It was clear they liked each other in real life (I found out after the movie that they did) so I never feared that one would leave the other. Wanting to get into trouble and adventures? Just like in The Sting, nobody could sell friendship on screen like these two. They were my favorite movie couple.” — JP

Salvatore Corsitto, left, and Marlon Brando in a scene from The Godfather 1972.

The Godfather

“Here Brando isn't a flashy mobster at all. He controls the family, He wants the best for the family. He has given them the American Dream. You can tell the actors looked up to him — and it works.” — CP

On the Waterfront

“This is really the young Brando’s film (we saw this after The Godfather). Watching this I could tell he was so different from the other actors we had seen from films in that era.

“Johnny Friendly (played by Lee J. Cobb) is a good villain, he seems like someone that had been as equally tough as Brando’s Terry Malloy when he was younger.

“But Terry, he is TOUGH… but raises pigeons. He doesn’t seem like he would need a full-time girl, but falls for Edie Doyle (played by Eva Marie Saint). Terry is ultimately vulnerable though, isn't he? The famous scene in the back of the cab… just look at the pain and disappointment on his face. That’s acting.” — CP

Lord of the Rings: Return of the King

“Our parents have the box set. One weekend, we watched them along with our grandmother and we were blown away.

“What I liked most in this film is the care it gave to the books and the audience. The director wasn't afraid to put everything on the screen. And more than any other sequel, it ties up all the storylines in a very satisfying way. One of the few scenes I cried at during our project was in this film: when Bilbo and Frodo decided to go away at the end.” — CP

Rain Man

“So many stories in one. A bro-pic. A road picture. A buddy pic. I had seen Dustin Hoffman in a lot of films previous to this, so I was somewhat prepared for his performance, but was not ready for Tom Cruise.

“If Tom’s Charlie character doesn't develop, if we don't empathize with him at a certain point, the story would have just fallen apart. But Cruise comes through. One thing me, my sister and my Dad can always do to laugh, is say the ‘97 X…BAM…The future of Rock and Roll’ line.

Tootsie

Dustin Hoffman from Tootsie (1982).

“Hoffman (as Michael Dorsey) can't keep, then can't get a job because he is a difficult method actor.

“But all the success he wanted opens up when he goes to an audition dressed as a woman, and gets a part in a big time soap opera.

“Dorothy (the female version of Michael) empowers women by being a role model for women, that alone is funny. BUT the scenes where he reveals he is a woman AND the scene where his agent and he argue over his portrayal of a ‘beefsteak tomato’ are hilarious. It’s a smart, funny comedy.” — JP

Some Like It Hot

“I thought Marilyn Monroe was pretty good. I liked her as the girl in Some Like It Hot. I liked the other people in the story too. The two guys were hilarious. The whole plot was super funny.

“The ending, oh my gosh the ending, where it’s the rich guy on the boat and he’s just like, ‘Let’s get married ’ — he says that to Jack Lemmon — and it’s like, ‘I'm a guy’ and he’s like, ‘Nobody’s perfect.’” — JP

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

“This was the last of the Jack Nicholson movies on our list that we watched. And up to then he could be counted on to play really cool characters, that could use his wits to get over on people.

“What I really loved about this movie was that Jack was the one that got hoodwinked. He had no idea what he had gotten himself into. All the scenes with the other patients are funny. When I found out that only he and Billy Bibbit (played by Brad Dourif) were the only involuntary patients, it made me sad. But I felt it made it a better movie because it showed Jack was capable of doing something for someone other than himself as he came to be more of a protector to Billy.

“Billy is one of my favorite characters, thinking of his death makes me sad even now. Billy seems to be pure goodness against Nurse Ratched's (Louise Fletcher) pure evil. I didn’t expect Jack to get lobotomized and mercy killed, but I was happy that he fought Nurse Ratched, for Billy, with all he had, to the end.” — JP

What They Learned From Watching So Many Classic Movies

Story Is What Matters

“If the story’s good or if it looks good, why does it matter if it’s silent, black and white? We'll watch it.” — CP

Movies Enable Connection

“After seeing all of these, I've got some good movie references and some inside jokes now. So I come out of this with a lot of positive things like I can talk about them with other people who have seen them.

“And I'm a kid, so I can talk about this to adults and can have something in common with them. I can appreciate other movies now because I just came out of this with more appreciation of movies.

“I like history, so I do this so I can remember it. Kids my age aren't going to really know some of these movies and so I feel pretty proud of myself knowing something that a lot of others, a lot of my peers, don't know.” — JP",https://medium.com/art-science/what-two-teenagers-learned-from-watching-every-best-picture-oscar-winner-6217311ca0c5,['The Academy'],2015-09-16 21:54:36.968000+00:00,"['Movies', 'Teenagers', 'Oscars']"

Monitoring and Alerting for Hadoop Jobs with Oozie,"We use Apache Oozie to schedule jobs on one of our Hadoop clusters. Some of these jobs deliver business-critical data to customers and internal users, and need various types of monitoring or alerting to notify our team of problems. This post discusses one such system of jobs, and two types of monitoring: Oozie SLAs, and the use of Oozie Decision Control Nodes.

The system

The Optimizely analytics backend processes around 3 billion events per day, using many types of open source software including extensive use of the Hadoop ecosystem. At one end of the data ingest pipelines, events are stored in the Avro file format on disk in large collections organized by date. We mine this raw event data for metrics and insights with a variety of tools, including batch computations with Hadoop MapReduce.

A typical Hadoop batch job counts monthly unique visitors across customer accounts. When designing the system to do this work, we considered the following characteristics of these jobs:

Not real time: the jobs only need to run every few hours

Recurrent: the jobs run on cron-style schedules, including hourly and daily

Large amounts of data to process: de-duplication of various unique IDs requires looking back at many days worth of data

Business critical: customers and internal users need regular, accurate results

These characteristics make such jobs good candidates for Oozie workflows of Hadoop MapReduce, Pig, file system and other actions — all scheduled with Oozie coordinators.

Monitoring job success and run time with Oozie SLAs

The first type of monitoring we set up for these jobs is Oozie’s very useful built in SLA system, which allows you to trigger alerts if a job:

Does not start at the expected time.

Does not end at the expected time.

And/or does not execute for the expected duration.

Any job with an SLA triggers an alert when it does not end successfully.

Since our jobs may take hours to run, we set fairly wide SLAs governing (start, end, and duration) and so far have primarily been alerted in cases of job failure.

Here’s an example coordinator with SLA:

The above is configured to email a team alias if the job goes out of its SLA, but for a more critical job that should never fail you can add multiple email alert contacts (including a pager email address).

Monitoring file size in HDFS with Oozie Decision Control Nodes

A few months ago, we encountered a bug where an error in the job scheduling caused some jobs to run at incorrect times, leading to incomplete results being written to unusually small files on HDFS. Oozie SLAs didn’t catch this, because the jobs were not failing or running outside of their scheduled times (since the schedule itself was wrong).

When designing regression tests for this issue, one solution we settled on was monitoring the size of the output files. To ensure that these files were reasonably large, we used Oozie’s Decision Control Node feature. This type of Oozie action allows you to use control-flow statements in your workflows: for example, you can split a workflow into two execution paths based on the results of a previous job, or the size of an existing file.

Here’s an complete example workflow which triggers alerts if the total size of files in a directory is too small:

Thanks for reading!

We hope this post is helpful in your own adventures with Oozie and Hadoop.

Before the All-Star Game,"Half a season of NBA stats and figures of the top 4 and bottom 4 teams

With the second half already in full swing I wanted to take a look at some NBA data of the top 2 and bottom 2 teams in both conferences to see what separates them besides just the wins and losses column.

This was more an exercise in exploratory data analysis (my thanks to https://github.com/Fossj117/NBAdata for the web scraper and @amitkaps who helped me figure out what I needed to get the data ready for dplyr) and I looked at just a few offensive stats. With one being 3 point shots and 2 different ways to take the shot, being as a pull up shot while dribbling the basketball and as a catch and shoot shot from a stationary position and hopefully open. There is a way to verify how open a player is on a particular shot (http://www.gregreda.com/2015/02/15/web-scraping-finding-the-api/) but the data used is just aggregate totals for the first half of the season. Another one is passes, touches, as well as assists. And another being drives to the basket and how many points the driving player gets a game and how many points the team produces a game on the same player driving to the basket.

Golden State Warriors

The Splash Brothers is an apt nickname as 5 players average over 2 attempts a game and 3 players averaging over 3 attempts. Of course attempts splash brothers does not make but the 3 players averaging over 3 attempts make quite a few of them with Stephen Curry at 41.3%, Klay Thompson at 44.6%, and Draymond Green hitting 34.7%.

With the pull-up 3FG being one of the hardest shots to make it is surprising that 1 player (Stephen Curry) takes 4.2 attempts a game, but when that players makes 40.4% we can see why he has free rein.",https://medium.com/medium-rare-only/before-the-all-star-game-34c008996059,['Michael Warner'],2015-03-02 22:01:15.916000+00:00,['Data Visualization']
"Moving to London: meal deals, mortality and the Pretpocalypse","Moving to the capital is a post-education must for many people. Confused suburbanite Matt Tidby writes about the perils and pleasures of London living.

“I’m thinking about the apocalypse a lot.” Photo: Jared Tarbell / Flickr.

A couple of weeks ago, I moved to London for the first time, to do a three month internship. I’d never spent more than a handful of days around so many people before, and in my self-assigned role as a lost suburbanite, it has been a quick and ever-expanding lesson, in pretty much everything, to drop in on the lives of these London people.

When eight million people live on top of each other, they have to keep moving otherwise their collective London wisdom has it that they’ll just form neat, static piles in the street and gather dust. Getting about is of paramount importance to the London people. They run up and down devices that were designed to make stairs faster and easier. They fling themselves through closing Tube doors, just to be at work/the pub/home a whole minute earlier. The train doors bump and beep with automatic delight — they’ve been whittling off bits of Londoner for some time now, building an army of patchwork creatures for when the machines rise up and take control.

Food is also a big thing in this city. I’m a notoriously fussy eater; as a child, I would freak out if vegetables came near any of the other constituent parts of a meal (I grew up in Hampshire, I had to find something to push against) and I still enter a state of acute anxiety when in unknown gastronomic environs.

So far, London has not helped me to relax in this regard. Pret A Manger are so omnipresent that I have begun to find them sinister; it feels like they’ve deliberately seeded themselves into the infrastructure of the city in order to seize executive power after the apocalypse. Many salads here involve gherkins, even though: a) they taste of gherkin, b) they’re called gherkins. There are even feeding rituals; the food in Itsu magically becomes affordable at 7.30pm, leading to a quite remarkable perfect storm of brogues and media beards that sweeps in and empties the shelves in a five minute frenzy. All that was missing was an Attenborough commentary; it was comically jarring to see a ritual as restrained as queuing appear so animistic. It made me feel somewhat incongruous for continuing to have faith in Tesco meal deals, but also kind of victorious too.

As is probably obvious, I’m thinking about the apocalypse a lot. Living in parallel with so much mortality encourages dystopian thought. I believe the benefit of the urban experience is the opportunity to see us for what we are when we put our minds to it: noble, well-intentioned, striving little ants, building and pushing, drinking and stumbling, mute in carriages and loud when loved — but still, essentially, good.

Nevertheless, urban isolation promotes the sense of the morose mass, the meaninglessness of the crowd — stoic units walking through underground tunnels, looking down, off to make worthless money and precious small talk. When I see dystopia, my reaction is to dream of utopia — the notion of collectivising the land and setting the souls of London free suddenly becomes a delightful, Elysian alternative to the sweat fugs of prime-time central line travel.

But people live in cities, and love them and aspire to them, and always have done; 14th-century bodies found by the recent Crossrail excavations have been attributed to every corner of the UK. If we were meant to live in balanced, dissipated communes, then history would not be the tale of great cities, the people in them and the things they did or didn’t do.

The infectiously positive thing about London, despite the dislocation, the fear and the Prets, is an overwhelming sense of momentum — people here ride the mortal coil like a helter-skelter, ravenously consuming experience, good and bad, as they go. When reality intercedes, whether through a predictable salad or a delayed train, they moan for 30 seconds or 140 characters and then they move on, keep spinning and change at Finsbury Park. It’s confusing and compulsive in equal measure, and if I ever go native, I’ll be on the first train to Cornwall.",https://medium.com/abstract-magazine/moving-to-london-meal-deals-mortality-and-the-pretpocalypse-e253d5fd9389,['Matt Tidby'],2015-11-28 13:01:54.812000+00:00,"['Life', 'London', 'Travel']"

I am smatter of rain in the morning and under-bridge goblins are my dearest disciples.

I grit teeth when I sleep and twittering birds cloy over me, collapsing on wind like prayers and dollar bills on my eyelids.

Fitting in and finding home,"By Carmel Delshad

I lost my father to cancer in August. He was 75. His story isn’t a Hollywood rags-to-riches tale of an immigrant making it big in America; he died with few possessions. But his death taught me a lot about the meaning of home and what it means to finally find comfort in yourself.

My father spent his early life floating around the Middle East, without an anchor and without a place to call home. He was uprooted from his family home in Haifa in 1948. His parents relied on the support of charities to get staple items like flour and sugar after losing their wealth from their successful jewelry business. They died within years of each other, and my father was left an orphan as a teenager. He used to tell me stories of how he went fishing as a teen just to be able to eat. It was a sudden and dramatic change of circumstances for a man who grew up playing with diamonds as if they were marbles on the floor of his father’s jewelry store.

Years later, he ended up in Egypt, where he met my mother. After spending more than a decade there as a successful business owner, the “American Dream” came calling, and my dad, desperate to make it in the world, left for the U.S. in the 1980s. It’s a common beginning to many immigrant stories.

It seems fitting that he ended up working in the hotel industry. How many times did someone check into his little hotel, looking for a place to call home, even if just for one night?",https://medium.com/aj-story-behind-the-story/fitting-in-and-finding-home-bb4cf637c3,['Carmel Delshad'],2015-10-26 17:52:43.978000+00:00,"['Immigration', 'Family', 'This Happened To Me']"
When Desperation Meets Opportunity Chapter 19 — A #NaNoWriMo 2015 Story,"Chapter 19 — Jim

She is sleeping on the couch. Even after years and all that has happened, she is still the girl I used to love. It is almost distracting watching her, knowing that she is in my life again. I meant what I said, that if I could do it over and do better, I would. As someone who always wanted to do the right thing, it kills me to have to face the biggest mistake I ever made in my. How selfish was I? To walk away from that. But, I was 18. I was scared. And when you are 18, your future is the only future that is important to you. Anyone who is 18 would struggle with that decision. My hope would be that anyone else make the right choice.

I need to focus. Mr. Man gave me some helpful tips for hacking into this badge. Essentially, this company uses something similar to a Micro-Sd card that you wave in front of an access point to gain entry. Soon, if it hasn’t happened already, they’ll have changed their systems to deny access to my card. What I need to do is load up the code on this badge, and find where the instructions to interact with their system are located. Then, it is simply a matter of tricking the system into thinking this is an active badge. Once I find the target code, it will just be a few adjustments and I should be on my way. Or, at least I hope.

Scanning code is becoming so much easier now after my month long boot camp. But, my eyes have a hard time concentrating. This situation is just so weird. Maggie has been doing things for Mr. Man as well. Are there any others? Was she chosen because she was connected to me? I would have to think so. What does it all mean? How does this game end? I’ve been trying to wrap my head around this since Maggie showed up at my door. I was okay with things. I was happy to help Mr. Man. But now, if it is really true that he took Brayden, it changes everything. That means bringing Jake back and looking through more binary code.

I’ve also been thinking through the fact that the company we found in the code is also the company I’m expected to bring down with the virus. That they have a place in Stetford could be part of the reason they chose Maggie. The key to finding out who Mr. Man is has to be related to the Cyberdigital Associates entry we found. That must be his company. Googling it doesn’t turn up much. They don’t list any employees or CEOs or anything. Once again, maybe there is something I’m missing here that Jake would be able to help with.

It is getting pretty late now. I’m not sure when the Ming Security and Defense building closes, but I have to imagine that they’d allow after hours access if you have a badge. They might have other security features, being a company that specializes in such things. But I should be able to get in and get what I need. It might be easier to do when the building is closed.

I finish with the code and feel confident that the changes I’ve made will let me in. It is starting to feel real now the seriousness of what I am about to accomplish. This won’t be easy to go through with. I spend so much time telling myself that I choose to do the right things, but this isn’t right. This is sabotage. This is illegal. And maybe, in other circumstances, I may have backed down to face the music. But learning about Brayden today keeps me focused on the goal. And finally I understand why Maggie is here. Mr. Man is using her to keep me going. That has to be it. I feel sick. This has become personal.

Maggie is still sleeping on the couch, and I decide not to wake her. Instead, I’m going to head out to the building and try and take care of this tonight. After this, I can’t imagine what I’ll be asked to do for my fifth task. How can it be any more ramped up than this? It doesn’t matter much. I have to do it. Maggie and I will also need to work on a plan, to try and figure out who Mr. Man is and how we can get to him. She needs to know that he has hacked her phone. We can’t afford a slip up. I’ll inform her when I get back.

I open my Uber App up and request a ride. Then, I head downstairs to the street level to wait. The sun has set, and darkness is falling over the city. It is weird quiet, even in the midst of the summer. Sure, people are everywhere. But it is almost like life has been muted.

Before long, my car has arrived, and we head toward our destination. The driver is a young guy, maybe 25 years old if you forced me to guess. We are listening to some rap music I have never heard before. He asks me “Sir, what type of music would you like to listen to?” Since I can tell my type of music would definitely not be his cup of tea, I decide I’ll endure this style for the ten minute ride.

“This is totally okay. You wouldn’t like my type of music. It’ll be good for me to listen to something that will expand my boundaries.” The rap is pretty terrible. Even after living in the city for almost a year, I can’t say that rap has gained any appeal for me. It does get my mind off my mission temporarily.

“So what are you up to, tonight sir?” I did say temporarily. What do I say to him?

“Just some late night business to attend to. Nothing exciting. You’d think they’d let me enjoy my Sunday night, but you know how things go.”

“Of course sir. I can take a longer route if you’d like to prolong things a bit — you can use the traffic as an excuse. Or, we can head down to some of the hot clubs downtown. Sundays still bring the ladies, but less competition.” This guy is certainly interesting, but what isn’t interesting is what he is offering. I have much more important things to do.

“That sounds tempting, but some other time.” He nods, and slows down as we reach our destination.

I actually asked to be dropped on the corner, not knowing what I’d encounter. I wish him a good night, and I jump off onto the sidewalk. This is a part of town I haven’t spent much time in. But, I’m not headed far. As I make my way up the street, I can make out the building for Ming Security and Defense. Here we go

As I am walking up to the door and look inside, I see at least three security guards at the entrance. Crap. They are waiting for whomever stole the badge to show up. I can’t just waltz in there now. I’ll have to think up some other plan. To try and avert suspicion, I slowly widen my walk away from the building and keep heading north.

I make my way up State Street to the next block. For some reason, I choose left over right. And that is when I see him. Carl. Sleeping with this family on the this street. He looks as rough as I’ve seen him. What happened? The need to find out overcomes me and I head straight toward him.

“Carl, is that you?” He is huddled up against his wife and child, but separates himself as he sits up, rubbing his eyes. He blinks hard a few times, before realizing that he knows me.

“Why if it isn’t Jim! How are ya Jim? Been a while.”

“Yes it has been. Why did you move over here? I kept looking for you everyday but you were never there. I feared the worst.”

Carl calmly replies. “It was the strangest thing. It must have been right after our dinner that I was settling down to sleep with my family. All of a sudden, some tough guy types started hassling us. One even pulled out a gun. Said if we didn’t leave the corner, then we never would. It isn’t much of a life living on the street, but a life is a terrible thing to waste. So we moved far enough away to where we felt safe.”

Right after our dinner this happened? That seems like too much of a coincidence. Now, he turns up here, after all of this time as passed. Unfortunately, dark thoughts enter my head. I need to get into that building. Could Carl help me get in?

“Carl, I am so sorry to hear that. It might sound weird, but I’ve missed you. I really enjoyed our time together and want to help you out. But I’m afraid that tonight, I need to ask you a favor. Something which I know I can never repay you for.” He doesn’t look sad or worried when I say this. He looks genuinely excited and happy to help.

“You fed me. You fed my family. You gave me a night off the street and a happy memory. Young man, I would be glad to help.” I was hoping he might say no.

“I hate to ask this, but I need to get into this building, just off State Street here. I don’t really want to go into the details, but there is security on the inside, and I won’t be able to get past them without some help. Somehow I need a diversion. I just…” Carl cuts me off.

“Consider it done. Just hang behind me and be ready to pounce in. You don’t have to explain. I know a thing or two about desperation. If anything happens to me, I just ask that you take care of my family.” This is a promise I would love to keep. I don’t know if I can, but I want to. I shake my head, agreeing. “Alright then. What are we waiting for?” He kisses the heads of his wife and son as they sleep soundly. He then stands up, and leads the way.

As we get closer to the front doors, he motions for me to stay back, out of sight of the guards. I am left to watch the events unfold as a bystander.

Carl casually walks up to the front door and enters, where the three guards converge on him. It is dark out, but there are some lights inside the building, so I have a general idea of what is going on. They appear to be having a discussion, and it looks like the guards are trying to shue him out. Just as it looks like Carl is about to leave, he doubles back, rushing towards a guard and scuffling with him. He grabs a gun, and sprints out the door. It looks more like a hobble for Carl. The three security officers give pursuit. This is my chance.

As the chase takes place, I quietly but quickly scamped towards the doors. I enter the first set, and I use my keycard to attempt to get into the second set. It works. I am in the building. Time to put this virus in place. The office building isn’t too confusing, but they do have a map. It clearly indicates where I can find some network connected labs. As I make my way towards my location, I swear I hear the distinct noise of gunshots in the distance. My body shudders.

Making Dependable #1,"I work at SilverStripe. Aside from the framework and CMS modules, we have many smaller modules to maintain. And recently it’s been difficult to demo bug fixes or new features, from multiple contributors/branches, in the same installation.

One of the ideas we’ve had is to create an application; which can build a custom Composer dependency map, and deploy that to a new server. It would also be great if there was an interface for deciding which dependencies are included, and a unique URL for each installation.

That’s what I want to build.

Creating A New Project

I’ve chosen to make this project in Laravel 5.x, for a couple of reasons:

I want to learn more about Laravel 5.x. I’m particularly interested the new features of 5.1. In addition to my work at SilverStripe, I also help run the Wellington Laravel meet-up group. This is something I’d like to share with them, and perhaps collaborate on as a group.

If you haven’t installed Composer, globally, then do that. You can find out how at https://getcomposer.org. Life’s too short to have to manage a composer.phar in every project…

So I’ve installed Laravel 5.x, via Composer:

$ composer create-project laravel/laravel dependable

Time to get some coffee…

Creating The Database

To begin with, I want to store developer details. Everybody that uses this (or whose repositories and branches are folded into new installations) need an account. It doesn’t have to have all of their information, but there needs to be a way for developers to connect with Github, and optionally set a password.

Connecting with Github seems to be a job for Socialite. I want to see what fields Github will give me before I create the database tables for the rest of the information…

$ composer require laravel/socialite

Have to remember to add the Socialite service provider and facade! The facade isn’t strictly necessary, but it makes the example code cleaner and is just as easy to write tests for.

This happens in ~/config/app.php

I also need to create application keys. You can create new application keys through https://github.com/settings/developers. For the URL I just set http://dependable.assertchris.io (even though that doesn’t exist yet). For the callback URL I set http://dependable.assertchris.io/connect/github.

I should add these keys to config:

""github"" => [

""client_id"" => env(""GITHUB_KEY""),

""client_secret"" => env(""GITHUB_SECRET""),

""redirect"" => env(""GITHUB_REDIRECT""),

],

This happens in ~/config/services.php

It’s going to be a pain to develop on a live URL, so I’ll fake it by adding a hosts entry:

127.0.0.1 dependable.assertchris.io

This happens in /etc/hosts

I also need to point my local web server to the public folder:

<VirtualHost *:80>

<Directory ""/path/to/dependable/public"">

AllowOverride All

Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks

Require all granted

</Directory>



DocumentRoot /path/to/dependable/public

ServerName dependable.assertchris.io

</VirtualHost>

This happens in /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

$ apachectl restart

This makes the site viewable, in a browser. Let’s add a couple of routes, to connect to a Github account:

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

use Laravel\Socialite\Facades\Socialite;



Route::get(""/"", ""WelcomeController@index"");



Route::get(""redirect/github"", function () {

return Socialite::with(""github"")->redirect();

});



Route::get(""connect/github"", function () {

$data = Socialite::with(""github"")->user();



// save data...

});

This happens in ~/app/Http/routes.php

Amazingly, this is all the code I need to get my Github profile details. The results resemble the following:

Laravel\Socialite\Two\User Object

(

[token] => 057e0a...

[id] => 200609...

[nickname] => assertchris

[name] => Christopher Pitt

[email] => cgpitt@gmail.com

[avatar] => https://avatars.githubusercontent.com...

[user] => Array

(

[login] => assertchris

...

)

)

Looks like I can get email, name and avatar. I can also list the repositories, which will be useful later. I’ll still need a password field, but I’m going to ignore it for now.

So I’ll need a table to store:

ID Name Nickname Email Avatar

I can add more to that later! I’ll generate an empty migration, and add the fields we need, after:

$ php artisan make:migration developer

I’ll add the fields I need:

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;



class Developer extends Migration

{

/**

* Run the migrations.

*/

public function up()

{

Schema::create(""developer"", function (Blueprint $table) {

$table->increments(""id"");

$table->string(""github_id"");

$table->string(""github_name"");

$table->string(""github_nickname"");

$table->string(""github_email"");

$table->string(""github_avatar"");

$table->timestamps();

});

}



/**

* Reverse the migrations.

*/

public function down()

{

Schema::dropIfExists(""developer"");

}

}

This happens in ~/database/migrations/

2015_05_26_000000_create_developer_table.php

I’ve also changed my default database driver to sqlite, and run the migrations with:

$ touch storage/database.sqlite

$ php artisan migrate

I’ll update the landing page, to show which developers are connected:

namespace App\Models;



use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;



class Developer extends Model

{

/**

* @var string

*/

protected $table = ""developer"";



/**

* @var array

*/

protected $fillable = [

""github_id"",

""github_nickname"",

""github_name"",

""github_email"",

""github_avatar"",

];

}

This happens in ~/app/Models/Developer.php

use App\Models\Developer;



Route::get(""connect/github"", function () {

$data = Socialite::with(""github"")->user();



$developer = Developer::where(""github_id"", $data->id)

->first();



if (!$developer) {

Developer::create([

""github_id"" => $data->id,

""github_nickname"" => $data->nickname,

""github_name"" => $data->name,

""github_email"" => $data->email,

""github_avatar"" => $data->avatar

]);

}



return redirect(""/"");

});

This happens in ~/app/Http/routes.php

use App\Models\Developer;



Route::get(""/"", function () {

$developers = Developer::all();



return view(""index"", [

""developers"" => $developers

]);

});

This happens in ~/app/Http/routes.php

<h1>Developers</h1>

<ol>

@foreach($developers as $developer)

<li>{{ $developer->github_name }}</li>

@endforeach

</ol>

<a href=""{{ url(""redirect/github"") }}"">Connect to Github</a>

This happens in ~/resources/views/index.blade.php

This list is rough, but it demonstrates how I can connect (with Github) and store knowledge of that connection in the database. The next step will be to gather repository data, so the application can start to create custom composer.json dependency maps…

Notes

Laravel ships with some scaffolding. It’s mostly to do with user management and authentication. I removed it with:

$ php artisan fresh

I also had to remove the User model, and change a few routes.

Effective Email Communication,"Let’s say you have attended a symposium and you have met a famous producer. Or you just ran into an A-Lister on a plane. Great news!

The bad news? This might only happen once or twice a year (but, more often than not, never).

Should you spend your whole year hoping? No. You have to plan your attack and reach out to them.

For various reasons I won’t list here, I’ve figured out that the best and most professional (and maybe… the safest?) way to reach out is via email.

Emails are imprinted in most professionals’ brains as their favourite way of being contacted. So let’s go for that, shall we?

The first step might be tracking down the correct email address (I’m not going to show you how), but sending a powerful email that gets opened, communicates your message, and gives them a reason to respond is the most important part of the equation.

Remember: you don’t have much time (or space) to grab their attention and make them actually care — using your words wisely is essential.

Let’s see how we can achieve this.

1. Keep it short (be concise)

You might see me publishing longform essays on my website — it’s obvious that I like talking a lot. But, when it comes to emails, I prefer to keep it short and to the point.

The most common mistake you can make during your first (or second, or third…) contact is to keep talking about stuff they don’t really care about. Your dreams or your ‘amazing’ new project can wait.

They don’t know you (and they probably need a reason to keep on reading), so only the absolutely critical info should make it into the first few exchanges.

Keep your messages short and concise. Important people value brevity more than you might think.

Think about it. When you receive hundreds of emails a day, what do you read — and answer — first? The emails from people you know and all the really short ones. The lengthy ones — especially if they come from strangers — either get deleted or archived in the ‘to answer later’ folder (which is to say that they usually get forgotten).

Through experimentation, I realised that 3 paragraphs with 2–3 sentences each are just perfect. More on that later.

2. Make it personalised (know who you’re talking to)

You know what spam means, right? Sending unsolicited messages without permission, often to a large amount of people. Most spam emails are written generically, so they can appeal to as many people as possible and increase the chance that someone actually opens the message.

They’re not personalized, and because of this, do not appeal individual persons.

This is the main issue with most senders today: they know the influencers they want to get in touch with, but they don’t help said influencers realise that the email has been sent exclusively to them!

Simply start with ‘Hi (their name here)’. It’s been said that ‘the best sound in the world is the sound of your name.’

Still… even if the influencer opens your email, they’ll likely be put off if they have to read a generic, monotonous email that could be a copy-paste template sent to 100s of other contacts,.

Don’t get embarrassed if they murmur ‘ufff… fuckin’ spammers again’. You’ve earned it.

Do your homework.

If you’re planning to contact someone important, spend time researching some notable details of their life and work. This information could include recent facts (which shows that you follow their work) or older ones (which screams ‘I’m a life-long fan of your work’). Ideally, be a real fan of their work.

No matter what, be (or at least look) genuine.

3. It’s all about them, not you

Imagine that you receive an email from a stranger, where they analyse their new idea. At the end, they ask you to be a helping hand or to promote their project.

‘Huh?’, would be your most possible response. ‘What will I get out of this? Will he just use my time and contacts? I don’t even know this person.’

Or, even worse: ‘How dare he?!?’

Can you put yourself in the shoes of the receiver? You’ll probably get what I mean.

Personally, I cannot find anything more repulsive than a person asking for help out of the blue, without building familiarity with me first.

Why?

Because I feel I’m being used.

Remember — every influencer is a human being and he or she wants to feel the human connection first, so they can have a strong reason to justify their actions. Influencers will be more open to the idea of helping a flesh and blood person like them, not some ghost they’ve never heard of.

Us human beings do enjoy helping without getting anything in return. It’s part of our DNA. However, we also do hate being used because we have power, contacts or influence (you name it).

It always helps if you make it clear (with words and actions) that this is a mutual value exchange.

And, since they don’t know you, first providing value that will help them to accomplish their goals and making the conversation all about them is the only way to go. It shows respect and points out that you don’t want to just take advantage of them (and then vanish into thin air).

Show that you intend to build a lasting relationship.

This is not always the rule; sometimes your emails will be answered just because they feel empathy, because they see the spark in your eyes or your desire for progress, which might excite them. This helped me get some projects off the ground and build a good portfolio of contacts when I first started out.

But it’s not a scalable or reliable strategy and it won’t happen often. Don’t just rely on empathy to win people over.

Not everybody has the time to care — make them care.

This is so important that it’s my responsibility to tell you: start by making it all about them and less (or not at all) about you.

4. Give them a little something, before you expect to get

I’ve heard so many complaints from important people, saying

‘This dude contacted me asking for this major favor, saying he’s in an emergency. I don’t even know this guy. How lame is that? If they’re in an emergency, then I’m in an emergency, and EVERYONE’s in an emergency. Things don’t work this way.’

It’s true that we often feel like we know (perhaps intimately) the important people we’re getting in touch with. Their public updates probably have helped us form a ‘persona’ about who they are. We’ve got value from their work and we’ve been following them for a while.

But, guess what? They don’t know you.

This is a major part of the problem; and results in no response: they’re not familiar with who you are.

All they see is a name and an email address. No human-to-human connection is formed. And, consequently, they feel less bad for not answering a stranger’s email rather than of someone they know.

‘Give before asking’ is a phrase that my parents used to say — maybe your parents did too! It makes sense, and I’ve seen it work numerous times before.

Remember, we’re human beings. We form bonds because there is some kind of exchange of value.

But, what do you give to a person that probably has everything they need at the moment?

Well, it’s easier than you think. A few suggestions:

1) Spot a problem they might be facing currently. Offer to be their helping hand.

From time to time they may talk about one of their challenges on social media. People are inclined to do that. Have your eyes open and provide a solution. It will take you a long way.

Important note: under normal circumstances, you doing them a huge favour could bring great results and definitely make them notice you. However, huge favours at an early stage might backfire: it might make them feel suspicious regarding the purity of this stranger’s intentions. Extreme reactions always seem to scare people off.

Thus, consider doing something smaller to begin with, always with genuine interest in helping and building a lasting relationship.

2) Provide valuable information.

Recommend a book, blog, website or other source of trusted information related to their current project/challenge or, if they’re talking about an interesting topic, contribute to the conversation by posting a relevant link. That can keep the discussion going.

Genuinely recommending a book, along with a thoughtful and relevant comment, shows that you’re a considerate, caring individual, not just a time-waster.

3) Be part of their public projects

I definitely don’t mean that you start building tents for their outdoor events!

If they have a blog, be part of the conversation and provide constructive comments.

If they have a community, share your thoughts and help them build value. From my own experience, I’m more likely to ask for feedback from an active and considerate member of my tribe, rather than from an individual that hasn’t personally engaged with me before.

We tend to be attracted by people who provide value. Always remember that.

4) Connect them with someone.

Becoming a connector is the easiest way to bring value.

You filter information for them, saving time, creating value and empathy — all with one simple gesture.

The more contacts you have, the better connector you can become. It snowballs.

5. Mention something they can relate with (a person or an event they know about)

Let’s get back to spamming again.

Spamming means that you send an unsolicited message that is not intended to go to any specific person.

Have you considered that sometimes your emails might accidentally look like spam?

While writing your email, if you fail to mention (early) how you know them or something familiar they can relate to, this omission might work against you. It goes along with #2 (make it personalised).

Go by the quote:

“Your goal is to make them read the first sentence. Then the first paragraph. Then the next one, till the end of your message.”

The first thing the influencer will notice is the length of the message (‘ok, it’s short, I’ll read it now really quick’), and then they will read the first sentence. This sentence needs to build familiarity, in order to grab their attention and keep them interested.

If nothing familiar or notable pops up there, then they’ll probably leave the rest of your message for later (or never).

Use simple sentences like:

“I’ve read your last interview with XY and I loved it, especially the part with…”

or

“Your friend Mario suggested that we talk, as he realised that we’re working on similar projects at the moment.”

(The last one has a bonus: it builds familiarity and mentions a common goal; which is a possible benefit and problem-solver for the influencer.)

If you can make them say ‘Ok, this is not spam. If Mario sent them my way, I should not ignore them,’ then congrats. It’s very likely that they’ll read the rest of the message.

6. Praise them

You like their work. Express it!

Praise (within reason) can help them like you more. Anyone knows that.

Think for yourself. Who do you like more: someone who gets excited about your accomplishments or someone who is always unimpressed?

Nobody hates praise, even people who get complimented all the time. There are psychological factors that boost our egos and how much we like the people that admire us and notice our hard work.

A genuine and thoughtful compliment can make them like you much easier.

It goes along with #2 (again). Knowing whom you’re talking to and praising something specific doesn’t only imply that you’re not spamming. It also shows that you appreciate them as a human and a professional. It creates empathy.

It doesn’t have to be something major. However, the more specific your praise, the better the response you’ll probably get.

“The part of your interview with BBC, where you expressed your theory on … was the biggest revelation for me. I’m now using these principles as guidelines for my work. Thanks.”

7. Clear call to action

This is the part of the email that most people mess up.

Say the influencer has read your short email ‘til the end (which means you’ve kept their interest), and now they’re ready to read the last few words, before the final greeting.

What should they read? Should you ask for something? Should you let them figure out for themselves? Should you play shy and retreat to your cave, without mentioning anything?

Before the final greeting is where you have to place a specific and concise Call-To-Action (CTA).

What is a CTA? It’s what you want them to do next.

Remember? You lead the conversation, not them. Being shy and leaving it up to them to figure out what next is a no-go.

Always be cautious: it’s human nature to always wonder ‘what can I do next’ and look for any obvious instructions/signs. If we see some, we can stop thinking so hard and relax. Following the obvious and default suggestion is a relief, since it removes the burden of us having to come up with a solution by ourselves.

You’ve cooked a meal that they’ll appreciate, and now all they have to do is sit back and enjoy. Why wouldn’t they?

In my opinion, emails with no clear Call-To-Action should not have been sent in the first place.

Important note: ask them for something trivial, which, ideally, gives THEM value. This will create a conversation, which is your first goal. If you ask them to remix your music for free, or connect you with XYZ executive, it won’t take you anywhere!

As a rule of thumb, what you give should be more than what you expect to get.

Want an example?

“…If you are free during these dates, here’s what you can do: Go to www.mywebsite.com/privateshow and write your email in the opt-in form, so I can include you +1 in the VIP list of the show.”

Pretty straightforward. You can make it as short as

‘Please go to www.competition.com/myband and vote for my song by clicking the red button.’

No ambiguous instructions. The simpler & the ‘dumber’, the higher the conversion & the more likely they are to do what you want them to do.

What if there are many things you want to ask of them?

In this case, please read the last bullet point. It will clear things up.

7+1. Don’t approach the message as a one-off conversation.

The famous and rather charismatic owner of WineLibrary.com, Gary Vaynerchuk, once said:

“Most entrepreneurs try to get a deal set in their first message. They act like 19-year-old boys. They try to fuck on the first date. Don’t do that, it’s ugly.”

Why rush, if you have a genuine interest on that person? Why look desperate, trying to get something as fast as possible?

Asking them for multiple things or telling them the story of your life in one email is ugly. You’re being that 19-year-old boy.

Trust me, it indicates that you don’t believe you’ll have another chance to talk to them. Sending a brief and well-constructed email with a clear call-to-action demonstrates your confidence and creates a favourable image about who you are. It shows focus and a relaxed attitude, which increases the chance that they’ll engage with you.

Everything starts with a confident person who wants to provide value. Who could resist that?

Think of it as a conversation at a party. You wouldn’t try and unload the story of your life on someone you met a few minutes ago. That wouldn’t seem natural and they would probably try to avoid you for the rest of the night. Instead, you would initiate a balanced conversation with flow and mutual value for both sides.As an initial CTA, sum up the single most important thing for them to do.

“To The Youth Of This City”,"The first day of May seemed to mark a turning point in the story of Freddie Gray, the Baltimore man who died of a severe spinal injury incurred while in police custody. His death set off a wave of protests that turned violent this past week. The State Attorney for Baltimore, Marilyn J.

“To the people of Baltimore and the demonstrators across America, I heard your call,” Mosby said as part of her statement. “For no justice, no peace.”

She also delivered a specific message to the youth of the city and, by extension, young people across the country:

“Last but certainly not least, to the youth of this city,” Mosby said. “I will seek justice on your behalf. This is a moment. This is your moment. Let’s ensure that we have peaceful and productive rallies, develop structural and systemic changes for generations to come.

What You (Don’t) Wear Matters

Comfortably Country

Sarah is neither uptight nor a free spirit. The best description I can offer is that she is comfortable with herself. She has simple tastes, with no pretensions at all. Sarah grew up in the country, an only child, and I’m sure calling her a tomboy wouldn’t offend her. In fact, she’s pretty proud of the fact she can keep up with the boys outdoors. Indoors, she’s no slouch, either. She owns an interior design and renovation company.

Though I’m not a morning person, I do sometimes actually make it to the gym. In the Great Metropolis and its suburbs, gyms are as plentiful as coffee shops. I met Sarah at a spinning class. Spinning is an absurd exercise routine in which a room full of women on stationary bikes are told to pedal as quickly as humanly possible for most of an hour, with a changing pace guided by loud music. Only a few of the participants manage to follow the instructor’s lead for the entire hour, and Sarah is one of those people. She ramps up to the beats of house music, and slows a bit to the latest pop tunes. The rest of us are at half-speed compared to Sarah and the overly enthusiastic instructor.

As we slowly made our way to the locker room following one of these morning workouts, Sarah asked if I’d like to stop by the club juice bar after showering. She said she had a story to share and knew I’d be interested. Fifteen minutes later, we were sitting at a small round aluminum table drinking more calories in pineapple-mango smoothie than we had burned. Okay, more calories than I had burned.

“I know I can seem a bit unpolished,” Sarah began.

“Not everyone goes for makeup and painted nails,” I replied.

“Fair enough, but I also know that men still like a lady who can trade in jeans and boots for skirts and heels. Even Luke has to get tired of seeing me covered in sawdust and sweat.”

I nodded. It’s true some men love a tomboy, but what makes her sexy is knowing there’s woman underneath the baseball cap or cowboy hat.

“I’m in the city three or four days a week. My office has a small apartment, good enough for me. While I’m stuck here I come go to the gym so I don’t go insane. I also run errands for things I can’t get easily near the horse ranch,” Sarah continued, “so I went skirt and dress shopping last week.”

“I didn’t know you owned a horse ranch,” I commented.

“Luke and I met at the stable. Turns out, his family owned the ranch and boarding stables. We met while I was prepping Rosie for a ride. He walked up in his uniform looking like Ranger Smith with a gun.” Sarah smiled at the memory. “Anyway, he sees me in jeans and boots and I was starting to worry that outside my wedding dress I don’t have a skirt or dress or anything feminine.”

This was going to be a nice, unsurprising story of a wife seducing her husband, I concluded, but those are still good stories to share.

“Well, it turns out you really should get fancy panties to go with those skirts and dresses.”

Now, she had my attention. I stopped sucking on the smoothie straw at the mention of panties.

“I thought you might like to hear about how I learned panties, or the lack of them, really makes the skirt work.”

“I love sharing a good lesson with my readers,” I assured her.

Sarah was more than happy to share….

Sarah’s Story

Luke and I live two hours from the city, in rolling hills. We have a few acres with the horse stables, a small walking arena, an even smaller apple orchard, and lots of privacy. The horse stable isn’t much of a business, so Luke still works as a forest ranger in the nearby state park. Most people don’t realize it, but a forest ranger is an armed police officer in our state. He’s normally a stickler for rules and is one of the most cautious people I know.

I have a woodshop where I restore and reclaim pieces for my clients. I come into the city on Tuesday and stay until Thursday or Friday. Maybe it’s not the best thing for a relationship, but I’m home every weekend and my clients understand that. We’re not fancy people, but we’re content enough. An urban cowgirl and her chiseled chin forest ranger.

The state park has a peaceful river and the standard picnic areas with outhouses and aging wooden tables anchored with concrete blocks. In the summer you need to hike a couple of miles to get away from people. During the early spring and late fall, the park is only busy on weekends except for a handful of people. It is during those pleasant off-season weeks when college students and families aren’t crowding the lower river that we take walks together and listen to the sounds of the water.

I had come home Thursday night because we had guests. Erin and Dan were staying with us while he conducted business in the city. It was a given Dan would spend almost every waking moment working, something I’ve never understood.

It was an unusually warm early spring evening, one of those early spring days when it is warm enough to be comfortable without dozens of layers. Erin asked if we could take the hike to see the river. She suggested Luke come along, and I eagerly agreed since I had been away from him for three days. He was in jeans and an olive-green forestry t-shirt, his standard off-duty uniform.

Before we left, Erin led me back to the house, where she changed into a sundress and sandals and I slipped into a no-frills knee-length denim skirt I had purchased in the city. I wore the skirt with a tie-dyed t-shirt of purples and pinks. I still went with a pair of boots, which I bought to go with the skirt. The outfit probably looks like it belongs back in the 1980s, but I liked the idea that even my skirt was denim and slightly practical.

As the three of us hiked along, Erin asked Luke about the plants, animals, and geography of the region. She was born and raised in Manhattan, and Central Park was her playground as a child. While there’s nothing like Central Park, it can’t compare to being out in the country.

When we reached the river area, Erin walked to the edge of the water, slipped off her sandal, and touched a toe into the water. “Damn, that’s cold.”

“It’s from the snowmelt,” Luke explained. “It’ll be like that in May and sometimes into early June.”

“It’s all snow?”

“No, but enough that you can’t be swimming in it until summer.”

“Have you ever skinny dipped in the river?” Erin asked, suddenly.

“No,” I replied. “When it is warm, there are people everywhere.”

“Really? Never?” Erin laughed. “Wouldn’t it be thrilling knowing it’s not some secret little private spot? The risk is part of the fun!”

“That would violate several state — “

“She’s kidding, Luke,” I interrupted.

“Oh. Good. We have enough problems during the summer.”

Always the forest ranger, I suppose that’s why I love him. Luke’s the great protector, like the hero in a John Ford movie.

“Oh, come on, guys. You have to at least think about it. Or fucking out here? Tell me you’ve at least made love under the stars out here.”

“Nope,” Luke answered. “Wouldn’t be right.”

“Geesh. You two are disgustingly law-abiding, then,” Erin said with a mock Western accent. “You all need to get frisky. Ride ‘em cowgirl and all that.”

“That’s really not our style,” Luke said, turning away to study the trees. I have no idea what he’s looking at sometimes, but he is always checking on everything in the forest.

Erin walked over to me and gave my arm a squeeze. “Tell me the truth,” she whispered.

“He was only speaking for himself. I’ve thought about it. What woman wouldn’t want to make love to a sexy lawman under the stars? It’s a great idea.”

“Thought so. We need to make that happen.” She analyzed the situation. I could see the gears turning. “Lose your panties.”

“What?” I barely maintained the whisper. Thankfully, Luke was mesmerized by something on the ground. I don’t even want to know what he was studying.

Erin pointed. There was a mesh trashcan chained to a post where the sand and grass met. I walked up to the can and hiked up the skirt a bit. I was wearing plain, brief cut, not very sexy, pink cotton panties. I slid them down my legs, and then stepped out of them one foot at a time. Holding the panties, I looked to Erin initially to avoid seeing Luke’s reaction.

“I always wondered what this would feel like.” I held the panties into the trashcan, and then looked at Luke. “You can buy me some sexier panties.”

“Those are what you wear?” asked a genuinely horrified Erin.

“They’re comfortable,” I responded, dropping them into the trashcan, “but nothing like this feeling.”

Erin reached under her sundress and stepped out of a tiny black thong. “These are what you need.” She walked over to Luke and made the smallest of lace bracelets from the panties. Slipping them onto his left wrist she said, “You need to get these for Sarah. Don’t forget that.”

“You can’t… do… that,” Luke sputtered.

“Why not?” Erin asked. “Is there a law that we have to wear underwear?”

“I suppose not.” Luke shook his head.

I walked over to Luke and took his right hand. “I don’t think he’ll forget.” I kissed Luke on the cheek. “If you buy them, I’ll have to shave a bit closer.”

Poor Luke looked like a deer staring into headlights. So I put my arms around him and kissed him again. And again. And again. As we kissed, I released Luke and reached under my tie-dyed t-shirt. I unhooked my bra and slipped the strap down my right arm. My tongue teased Luke’s, distracting him long enough to let me get completely free of the bra, which I let fall to the ground.

I put my arms around Luke again and pulled my waist tight against him.

I moved my head slowly back, looked into Luke’s eyes, and then turned to Erin. “Don’t you think kissing is better when he’s grabbing your tits?” I asked.

I knew Luke and Erin were both stunned by my use of “tits” instead of “breasts.” I also knew it would really get to Luke.

“Oh, yes,” Erin responded slowly. “Yes, I do.”

I placed my lips against Luke’s and guided his left hand over my clothed breast. Once his hand was over my breast, my nipples hard, I put my arms back around his waist to keep him close. Luke fondled my breast and then pinched the nipple gently. The more he teased, the more passionate and deeper our kissing.

“I need you inside of me.” I couldn’t believe I said it right there, but I sure meant it.

“What about — ”

“Erin? She’ll just have to watch.”

If Erin reacted at all, I didn’t notice. I was too intent on Luke’s body. I reached down and unzipped Luke’s jeans. Slipping my hand into his boxers, I pulled out his eager dick and looked over to Erin. “Nice isn’t it?” It throbbed as Luke nervously tensed, somewhere between shocked and thrilled.

“Yes, it is,” she agreed.

Luke made a move to cover himself, but I prevented with my free hand. I tightened and loosened my grip, keeping him hard.

“Come on, Sarah, we shouldn’t — “

“Oh, yes we should,” I corrected him. “I’ve wanted to do this for a long time.”

I released his dick, leaving Luke exposed. I walked towards him, slowly, driving him backwards toward one of the old wooden picnic tables. As his legs hit the bench, his butt hit the top of the table and he sat on the edge. Luke placed his legs on the bench, and I sat between them.

As I took his dick again, Erin sat beside me. She watched as I stroked Luke and teased him. Erin was quiet. I looked at her and she smiled gently and nodded. She was sitting cross-legged facing me, her sandals on the ground.

I took Luke into my mouth and made circles around the head with my tongue. In your mouth, everything seems larger. You know what I mean. Think about when you suck on a mint: you can feel the letters on the hard surface. I was studying Luke’s dick with my tongue. I had never done that before. It was so personal, so intimate, that I quivered with excitement.

Luke leaned back. I lifted my head, teasing his dick with a final kiss. I stepped up onto the bench and looked down at Luke. I looked to Erin for approval. She had her hands clasped watching us intently. I wasn’t sure this would work well. I used my right boot to kick off the left, and then my bare left foot removed the right. The boots clunked to the ground. I stepped from the bench to the table and lifted my skirt to Luke could get a nice view. His dick pointed upwards, slightly.

I placed my bare feet on other side of Luke and lowered myself. I reached down and lifted his dick just enough to slide over it and sit down on his lap. I let my skirt cover us and rocked slowly back and forth. Luke sat up again, and we kissed.

This wasn’t quite right, so I lifted off Luke just enough. He knew what I wanted and pushed his jeans down a bit. Lowering myself again, this was much better. We resumed making love, with Erin watching.

Erin stood up and moved to the table, once again sitting cross-legged towards me. She lifted her dress and began masturbating while I made love to Luke. He looked to the side, watching Erin touch herself. I felt him inside me and knew he loved this illicit play. I wondered if Erin would tell Dan that she watched Luke and me on that table.

I rocked for a while, before changing positions so I could slide up and down on Luke’s lap. As I rose and lowered myself with increasing speed, Erin masturbated in synch with my movements.

When I knew that Luke was getting close, I moved off and sat across his legs. I stroked him only a few times before he came like a fountain. It got all over both of us, and we didn’t care. Erin was still touching herself. Luke had to lean back to catch his breath.

Erin moaned and shook, and I was sure some birds flew out of the trees. “That was great!” she finally exclaimed.

The three of us left the picnic table. We each splashed the ice-cold water on our faces and rinsed our hands. The cold was sharp, almost painful, but it also awaked me after making love. Luke seemed refreshed, too.

We hiked back to our house in near-darkness. We found Dan sitting at our kitchen table, his laptop open, his face inches from the screen. He didn’t look up from the spreadsheet on the screen.

“You guys have a nice hike?”

“Yes we did,” Erin replied. She walked to behind Dan and kissed his cheek. “Too bad you didn’t join us.”

“Sorry. I have to get this work done.”

Erin kissed her husband again. “I know. Trust me, I know.”

We left Dan behind and walked into the living room.

“I need a shower,” Luke said, looking at me.

“Yes. We both do,” I suggested.

As we walked towards our bedroom, I realized Erin was following. It seemed she really liked watching another couple.

Romance Watched

Sarah shifted a bit in the café chair. She had enjoyed sharing her story with me. While it was still a simple story of a wife seducing her husband, I obviously liked it enough to want to share it with my readers. It is a romantic, passionate love between two people who let themselves be watched.

“Did you talk to Luke about being watched?” I asked.

“No. I think it was special enough that I don’t need to mention it. What do you think?”

“That makes sense to me,” I agreed.

Being watched is a common fantasy, as many of the stories I’ve collected reveal. There are many reasons for this, from demonstrating that a man is yours to wanting the attention of another woman. It is interesting to ask yourself why you want to be seen. What is the thrill, for you? I’ve always been keenly aware that part of me wants a physical relationship with both the man in my life and the woman I invite to observe us. I mentioned this to Sarah to see if that might be true for her.

“I just loved the idea that we could get caught. The risk, however slight it really was, made the sex more intense. And something about Erin seeing Luke exposed, that was thrilling,” Sarah admitted. “I could never share Luke, not physically, but this was really close to doing that.”

Close to a threesome was good enough for Sarah and Luke. Maybe more couples should be as open with a friend or two present.",https://medium.com/true-love-romance-sex/down-by-the-river-10386d901105,['T. D. Simone'],2015-03-08 16:25:25.439000+00:00,"['Relationships', 'Erotica', 'Romance']"
The Art Of Conversation Is Dying,"Arnold Lakhovsky, The Conversation (circa 1935)

‘Conversation (noun): talk between two or more ​people in which ​thoughts, ​feelings, and ​ideas are ​expressed, ​questions are ​asked and ​answered, or ​news and ​information is ​exchanged.’

I’m really worried that the verbal conversation is dying. I fear that one day all people will ever talk about is the weather or what they ate for lunch (even though it’s probably on Instagram). Some people just can’t carry a conversation, some are happy to sit by listen and contribute now and again. Others may not feel confident or have enough conviction in the point or ideas they are trying to convey. One of the troubles with technology driven communication is that you have a lot of time to compose and put your point of view across. This causes you to tailor your response, lose some intensity or mis-communicate your point. Having a verbal conversation lends itself to being more open, honest and generally a more positive experience.

Being incredibly self-centered in a conversation is probably one of the worst things you can do to stifle or break-up a conversation. There are generally two reason this happens. You firmly believe that everything you say has more weight and value than others or that you have confidence issues that mean you have to seek validation or approval from your peers. I am very conscious of the fact I come across as self-centred at the moment and it’s down to my confidence. This post is a reminder to myself to take my own advice. It pains me to write this as a basic guideline of how a conversation works and how to sit down and have a ‘conversation’

How to have a better conversation:

1) Actually fucking listen to what the person is saying.

2) If you don’t hear something clearly, don’t pretend you heard it. Ask them to repeat themselves.

3) Ask relevant questions, don’t be afraid to ask someone to clarify if you’re unsure

4) Chill the hell out, if what you are wanting to say is so important you’ll remember it instead of blurting it out and disrupting the flow of conversation.

5) It’s okay for people to have different opinions and for them to challenge your point of view. This is not a cue to get defensive or become entrenched in your view. Fight your corner but also don’t be afraid to concede that you may be wrong

6) Include other people in the conversation, reach out ask someone’s opinions or thoughts on the subject.

These are just a few simple things that people (myself included) do forget and are worth remembering. Have yourself a better conversation this Christmas.

Naked Exposure,"Photography inherently pries and inquires. It seeks out the corners of the human experience, and carves a shallow bed wherever it pleases. There aren’t many places that I’d never been with a camera.

But there was one.

It was a strange thing for someone to photograph. The thought of it feels inappropriate, almost insensitive. I had no qualms about following my camera into an emergency room, or leading it into the hallways of a twisted nightclub, or the empty streets in a bad part of the city. I didn’t understand how different this might be until after I experienced it. This, this was different.

Time had bestowed upon me nearly every kind of photography experience: Weddings, funerals, birthdays, graduations, retirements, reunions, presentations and performances. After pouring thousands of photographs into my computer, I wore my experience humbly, like a blanket covering my last shred of naked insecurity.

So I immediately acquiesced when Madison asked me to photograph her at the end of the nine long months.

“Yeah, I can definitely do that,” I said, confident and unwavering in my certainty.

I’d never been present at a birth. My mother never had any children after me, and until I met Madison, no one in my close circle of friends had ever been pregnant for very long. I knew what it was like though — I’d seen pictures and video and heard plenty of stories about what it was like to push another human out of your own body.

I tried to wrap my mind around the idea of what it might be like to invent another human being, the same way a painter crafts a painting or a composer threads a symphony together, note by note.

Madison’s due date approached, and I began keeping my car fueled, my cell phone charged, and my camera by my bedside table. A distorted anticipation rose in my mind. I had that feeling you get right before Christmas, mixed with the enduring dread that precedes having a tooth pulled.

I studied birth photography, and tried to acclimate myself to the idea of photographing something so intimate as the creation of another human being. My eyes grew tired of seeing grimacing women and supportive husbands, young, wet flesh, exposed thighs and swollen bodies, but I trained myself to be comfortable with the raw intimacy.

My phone rang at 3:30 a.m. Twelve minutes later, I rushed into the maternity unit at Westdale Hospital.

Nobody tells you what birth sounds like. Nobody tells you what birth smells like. I tried to focus both my camera, and my attention, but my concentration fled the room and viciously slipped away. I pressed my face against the viewfinder and snapped half a dozen pictures — blurry and dark, marred with flashes of exposed flesh. I followed my concentration right out of the room.

I walked slowly to the bathroom, dazed and completely overcome.

“Get up. Oh, god. Get up. What’s wrong with you?” I heard myself whisper.

But my body rejected my demands, and I sat down in a stall. I shut my eyes, until I decided that the only way to cleanse my mind was to keep them open.

I pulled my pants off and looked at my body and wondered how in the world anything like what I just saw could actually occur. The raw, visceral act of creation stung my mind like ice.

I looked at my camera, and then let it fall. It hit the bathroom tile with a frozen mechanical crash, and the lens shattered.

I stood and clothed myself and returned to the room, where Madison held her newborn in her arms. Sweat drenched her naked skin, but she smiled through the thick layer of exhaustion. Her husband wrapped his hands around her shoulders and watched as Madison studied her life for the first time.

What I Wanted To Wear: Tied Up,"What I Wanted To Wear: Tied Up

I’ve been attracted to ties for a long time, well before I came out as trans. Over the years I’ve put together a collection of office-appropriate ties, skinny punk boy ties, bow ties, and even a silk ascot for… I don’t know. The kind of events one wears ascots to.

My last job, however, was client-facing, with a formalized dress code. I had not yet begun transitioning, and in an effort to find clothes that looked like they actually fit me, I resorted to pants and shirts from the “ladies” section of the store. Everything I’d ever learned about a great straight-leg pant from watching What Not To Wear crowded into my head, but I didn’t see myself in any of them. I bought voluminous slouchy cardigans I could hide in. With my short hair and chunky shoes and femme-presenting significant other, my coworkers pegged me for a butch lesbian, and I let them.

They were nice. I wasn’t afraid, exactly. But they didn’t get it, and it seemed easier to cross-dress every day than to explain, somehow. My weekends were already full of double-takes and “excuse me”s as I tried to correct people into reading me as male. The idea of doing it every day — and not just with my coworkers, but with an unending stream of new clients from all walks of life — just seemed exhausting.

Now I’m working from home, and I have no need for ties except for the occasional job interview. I’m getting closer to being read as male reliably. But there’s still a moment of hesitation when I’m getting dressed, or when someone uses the wrong pronouns, or when my spouse and I get addressed as “ladies.”

I ask myself: How much do I want to have this discussion right now? Is someone going to look me over and ask “what are you?” today? Is it going to be a good day, where I get “sir” from the clerk? And there’s no guaranteed answer, no single moment in life where I flip the switch from “feminine” to “masculine” and it always works.

I’m lucky, because I live in a progressive area, and because I tend to be read as a lesbian rather than face many of the safety issues trans women have to deal with. But it’s also a little disappointing to think we live in a society where merely being misgendered and scrutinized is considered lucky.

I still feel self-conscious when I wear a tie. It feels like I’m actively daring the world to read me as male, when most men’s clothing is considered relatively neutral by onlookers. But even as it makes me anxious, it’s also a declaration that I rarely get to make otherwise. Here I am. I dare you to call me sir.

Spanish Medium — It Must Happen!,"“I’ve learned to follow the hunch, but never assume where it would go” — Ev Williams

Now that everybody on Medium is buzzing about the redesign of the logo, the new API, and monetization opportunities, it’s time to look at another gap:

Medium must be in Spanish.

A Medium in Spanish is not the same as a Spanish Medium.

We, the Spanish-speaking people, are social animals. We love conversations. Our culture is built on conversations. This is the reason social networks have an incredible penetration rate in Spanish-speaking countries, surpassing, in relative terms, the penetration rate of any other country in the world — including the US.

One of the reasons I love Medium is the lovely people I’ve found here. I like to get involved with people who are doing exactly the same thing as I am: expressing themselves and trying to find their place. These tangles always bring good things. Most of these people are native English speakers. Language is not a problem in my case, but it is really a big challenge for other Spanish speakers who are getting into Medium in search of the same things I look for, and not finding them. And 410 million people, whose culture is dominated by the art of conversation do not have an online, long-form conversation platform.

Then the answer is a Spanish Medium.

Spanish language around the world. Source.

Medium was born in English, and it’s still a toddler. Communities and conversations are flourishing now. Everything is new, and, as anything new, it is yet to be fully built.

Spanish is the third most prevalent language on the internet, in terms number of users (after English and Chinese). Ten percent of the internet is built in Spanish — English represents 30%. Spanish is a first language for 410 million people, and a second language for another 90 million. It’s the de facto second language in the United States, spoken at home by 52 million people. The Spanish language is the gateway to South America and to Spain. We are a huge community and we are willing to be early adopters of any new cool stuff out there. However, Medium is not just cool stuff out there. Medium is the place where, once you’ve stepped in, you want to stay and live.

Spanish has always been a language (and a culture) that values the written word. Some of the most renowned authors are Spanish and Latin American. Think about Antonio Muñoz Molina, about Mario Vargas Llosa, about Isabel Allende — to name just three who are still alive. There is also a growing culture of slow reading; Jotdown, Libero, or Yorokobu are some good examples of this new trend: quality pieces that people love to read and are willing to pay for, just like print magazines or any other merchandising articles brands sell in their online stores.

However, online conversations in Spanish are mainly happening on Facebook and Twitter now. We don’t have any alternatives — for now — to these social networks to spread our ideas. And these ideas are clearly siloed and hard to discover for anyone not following someone. These ideas should be growing and spreading faster, but we are stuck in Facebook…

I know (because of the examples mentioned above) that the Spanish-speaking audience is craving for a site to funnel this need for slow reading + slow writing + relaxed conversations.

And, from what I see, Spanish Medium is the answer.

Yet, despite being the language that 410 million people are speaking at any given time, the language that naturally matches discussion, the language whose culture embraces conversation, there are only 108 publications in Spanish, all of them collected in an index by Medium en Español. But,

many have not been updated for over a year. Some are updated just twice or three times a year.

some are just translations from English language publications or official Medium publications, as are La Historia, En Español, Centro de Ayuda or Motivaciones de Escritura.

some are not 100% in Spanish, but a mix of Spanish and English.

one is misleading, as it has the same name — and purpose — as the official publication, Medium en Español.

This is not the way to attract a Spanish-speaking audience.

Sharing a language shortens the psychological distance between people.

When I started writing on Medium I did it in English, but soon realized some of my topics needed to be in Spanish, so I started writing for Medium en Español, the official publication. I also became a translator because I wanted to share with “my” community some of the great thoughts and ideas I was reading around here. This has also allowed me to get in touch and connect with English authors, which has also enriched my community.

But, how do we attract a Spanish-speaking community? There’s no magic. People are willing to come to Medium in search of a place to read and write quality content. But there’s not enough content because of the language barrier. The platform has to be in Spanish.

Estimates of the number of Internet users by language as of December 31, 2013. Source Wikipedia.

This is not the first time I’ve gone through something like this. I remember when Facebook and Twitter were only available in English. Some of us were able to be there, our English level was good enough; but that’s not the case for the majority of the Spanish community. I like to have language set to English everywhere, on my computer, in the social networks setup, on my cell phone… but, as I say, it’s obviously not the case for most of Spanish speakers. When Facebook reached an international audience, it was soon opened to translation (between 2007 and 2008) by engaged community members because again, we like to see things in our native languages. Same thing for Twitter, though in its case the Spanish version arrived in 2009.

It’s the economy, stupid!

Many people in Spanish-speaking countries learn English, but not everybody is able to understand a long thoughtful essay, and even less so to write their own ideas. A Spanish Medium would have the opportunity to engage in a market of 410 million people that’s experiencing a spectacular growth of more than 800% since 2005.

Spanish-speaking countries share more than the language. They share an economy. It’s estimated that multilateral trade among them exists because sharing the language reduces the cost of business transactions. And we are talking about an economy whose total GDP is more than 5 trillion €. This is not a second class economy.

In addition, we need to take into account that Spanish has also become — over the last decade — a powerful business language in the United States. And it’s still growing.

Spanish-speaking countries, as we have seen, also share a common cultural background. The cultural background might sound absurd when talking about GDP, yet it is as important as relationships between the UK and the US, or between the US and Canada. Culture means money in this context, and if I think about mainly cultural expenses, Spain and South America, for instance, share editorials, share a cinema industry, a music industry… There are no borders when it comes to language, even when slight differences in meanings, as it were, make us smile from time to time. Don’t try to say the verb coger (to take) in Argentina, for example, because this word’s meaning in that country could get you in trouble.

However, understanding a little bit of local cultures is a must before going fishing in a different ocean.

When Facebook landed in Spain, as I said before, the platform was in English. By that time, some tech savvy guys here built Tuenti, completely in Spanish. This social network was a great success, above all among teenagers, and it took Facebook many years to beat Tuenti in terms of number of users, and, of course, in terms of revenue in Spain.

Spanish Medium — how it happens

I’ve spent the last 8 years making things happen online. I’ve won a Bitacoras Award (the most important award for blogs in Spanish) for my project unadocenade.com, a collaborative lists site. I’ve implemented social networks at the regional government level, and have taught many civil servants in City Halls around Spain. I’ve worked with international teams which include South, North American, and European countries.

I want to lead a Spanish Medium because I believe the future of the world is dependent on all cultures sharing ideas first in their native languages and then with others.

Medium needs to hire a small team to make this happen.

Think of Wikipedia. It’s edited by a legion of volunteers, but there’s a team behind it all making sure everything works properly.

A team is needed that combines PR functions, with strong writing/editing skills; a team that has the background knowledge of the cultural differences between the Spanish-speaking countries; a team with strong connections with local celebrities, journalists, and also with writers and bloggers; a team with experience leading writing projects on the Spanish internet; and a team with international experience and connections as well.

This team would lead the troop of volunteers, translators, writers. Exactly in the same way there’s a team working towards Medium’s growth in English.

Popularity matters

Why is Medium so popular? There are a few factors involved. One of them is the community around it. Medium hired a perfect team. Everybody is spreading the word from their own publications, sharing their love, sharing their little corner of the world with their own communities.

Another way it’s getting more popular is by getting some celebrities engaged in the community. It seems these celebrities are already using Medium. I’ve read articles by Bono, Melinda Gates, Mitt… These are globally known people. There are a lot of journalists and TV personalities as well. That’s a key point. Get someone well known to write on Medium and people will follow them. There are no journalists, no TV stars, no singers, no politicians, no thoughtful leaders from any of the Spanish-speaking countries in here, and we need them to engage more and more people. People and companies that are leading the way in these countries are mostly doing self-advertising of their articles on other sites. They haven’t understood anything.

We’ve seen this before.

Do you run to get off your butt? Perhaps you want to use running as a substitute for other things. Do you want to watch less TV? Get away from your desk? Be outside more? Feel alive? Not every goal has to be a long-term thing. Short-term goals are just as valuable.

Do you run to become a better person? That implies you have longer-term goals. Do you want to run an ultramarathon? Thru-hike the PCT? Climb all of the Fourteeners in the lower 48? Have energy to go out and do stuff when you’re in your 60’s and 70’s?

Do you run to feel good about yourself? Think about how you run. Do you feel best when you’re at a casual lope? When you’re cooling down after a hard interval workout? When you run past a familiar viewpoint? When you achieve another milestone in your training?

Do you run to be alone with your thoughts? Consider what environment suits you best. Do you enjoy pounding the pavement downtown? Do you prefer wooded trails in the mountains? Do you want to explore your part of the world, or stick with the old and familiar?

Toastmasters: Better than Psychotherapy and Cheaper than a Ferrari,"Toastmasters: Better than Psychotherapy and Cheaper than a Ferrari

From birth, we’re taught to compartmentalize, to separate our personal life from our professional life, our hobbies from our careers. We’re asked to categorize sex, gender, class, race and culture, placing each and every person in a tightly closed box. It’s a world where every item has a name, every color has a number, every animal has a phylum. In short, it’s suffocating.

Our lives have been fractionalized into a tiny, minuscule parts that are neither relevant nor coherent to the way we live from day to day. But what if they could be…

Several years ago, a close friend of mine challenged me to join Toastmasters by stating with unwavering certainty, “You totally belong here Gabriella”.

“I belong in a public speaking organization? You must be smoking crack,” I replied. “I neither care, nor know how to speak in public. That’s not my forte, and I seriously can’t be bothered.”

“Give it a try, just once. That’s all I’m asking.”

Weeks later, I eventually caved in and sat among 40 highly extraverted people in a small, cramped meeting room above a bank. And despite the uncanny feeling that I was trapped in some bizarre threesome between an alcoholics anonymous meeting, a corporate boardroom and an amateur improv group, I was hooked!

For the first time in my life, I was challenged to look among an audience of strangers and admit that I was scared to be me. Terrified really. I feared that my ideas were stupid and my feelings were inconsequential, that everything I embodied was a pit of failure. The irony was that no one — not one person — ever reflected that back to me.

Over the course of a few sessions, I quickly understood that communication was not only my passion, but that the skills I was acquiring were applicable to my everyday life!

These weren’t just presentation skills, these were the building blocks of a happy human existence!

Allow me to share the top 5 ways that Toastmasters has impacted my everyday life:

Power Pose! Stated simply, it’s a position of strength when you’re on stage. Your back is straight, your arms are to your side and your eyes are engaged on the individual. As woman, I can’t tell you how important this is. Many of us have been socially conditioned to hide, to shrink from the world, from leadership, from ourselves. Our eyes avert being “seen”, our arms cross to hide “imperfect” bodies, our shoulders slouch to avoid confrontation. We become masters of invisibility, of transparency. Public speaking pushes us to stand tall, to be confident, and to approach the world head on. Key Message. On more than one occasion, I’ve allowed my brain to take a sabbatical, only to find a neurotic, emotionally unstable, cracked out ego in control. During these “rare” moments, conversations take a hallucinogenic twist where adjectives, adverbs and guttural sounds replace nouns and verbs. What could be a rational conversation about a my mom forgetting my birthday turns into, “Then…really, ahhh, you know when…it’s just….you know…mad…because...whatever!, doesn’t matter, I’m fine!” You’ll notice there’s no introduction, body or conclusion to my message. There’s nothing! I’m saying…nothing! A great speech must have all 3 elements, but so too must any conversation in our life. If we don’t know the key message, it’s time to rewrite the “speech”. Unadulterated Compassion. It’s easy to bitch, to react without a second thought, “Jesus, you’re so impatient! Can’t you wait for 2 seconds while I complete my sentence? Seriously!” We do this all the time, either in our heads or to those around us. We harshly criticize the world because it gives us a compass as to what we want and need in our lives….or maybe what we want to avoid. It’s our mirror. What’s not easy to do is to share our thoughts and feelings in a way that encourages trust and opens the door for dialogue and change. By stepping into a speaker’s shoes, the audience, or the exhausted clerk from the supermarket who hasn’t slept in 3 days because she’s working 15 hour shifts, we zero in on what’s important. What truly matters. And then craft our message with their feelings in mind. The message shouldn’t shift, but the way in which we frame it does. Truth from Fiction. I’ve heard thousands of political pundits, used car salesmen and marketing gurus sell their magic potions of happiness. “If you buy this car for 9,999 euros, with the bikini clad woman lounged awkwardly on the hood, your hair will grow back, your sexual prowess will increase and your annual income will triple! This is a once in a lifetime offer, so buy today!” Deep within all of us, there’s a bullshit meter. It may be a bit rusty from nonuse, but it exists. Oftentimes in public speaking, we assume we can pull the wool over the audience, sharing false emotions or speeches we don’t believe in. The irony is that they’re clever, very clever, and they may not know why they think you’re full of shit, but they’re not swayed. Ensuring that you truly believe what you’re saying is key to a great speech. Equally true is knowing when you’re not being 100% honest with people in your own life, or more importantly, yourself. Because in the end, the truth is going to sneak out one way or another. Unconditional Trust. You can’t prepare for life, can you? Sure you can do you research, but you have no guarantee of what’s going happen from one moment to the next. It’s a game of Russian Roulette. In Toastmasters, you’re trained not only in prepared speeches, but improv — two minute “on the fly” storytelling. These stories must impact the audience, be believable and leave a lasting impression! This is NOT easy, because to be good at improv, you need to trust yourself, to believe in yourself. These skills are no different from acing a job interview, a first date or bungee jumping into the Amazon River (hello Piranhas!). It’s a matter of trust, and the more we can cultivate this skill, the greater potential we have of achieving our goals.

In the end, we’re not inanimate objects. We can’t separate our lives into perfectly stacked cubes that don’t interconnect, that aren’t impacted by everything around us. We’re human, which means that everything interconnects, that our lives are constantly moving, shifting and communicating. The more I can find synergy between these, some level of balance, the happier I am.",https://medium.com/the-human-project/toastmasters-better-than-psychotherapy-and-cheaper-than-a-ferrari-a31db609b09b,['Gabriella Opaz'],2015-07-14 13:57:51.154000+00:00,"['Toastmasters', 'Humanity', 'Communication']"
Social Media in Schools,"New Jersey has recently passed a bill requiring social media to be taught in middle schools. The social media curriculum will include topics such as responsible use of social media, cyber safety and security, and potential negatives consequences of inappropriate use.

The bill has been passed in an effort to combat cyber bullying and to educate young people on best practices and appropriate usage of various social networks. With a greater number of social media platforms more accessible now than ever before, young people are much more able to make a social impact online without realizing (or caring about) the consequences of their actions.

Not only can youngsters use their phones to send text messages to their friends, but they can also use a myriad of mobile apps to connect instantly with their classmates and peers. Many teens, instead of sending a text, are simply tweeting at their friends, sending them a Facebook message or Direct Message over Twitter, or a photo/video message via Instagram Direct. Using these social media platforms to connect with friends can be as easy, if not easier, than texting.

The discussion of social media in schools raises three important concerns:

Who will be responsible for choosing the curriculum included in this new social media education?

Young people are using social media regularly (in many cases, on a daily basis). If teens and adolescents are going to be spending a significant amount of time online, it stands to reason that they should be well educated on how to conduct themselves appropriately while they do so. However, the passing of this bill has brought up some debate over who should be doing the teaching. Many people believe schoolteachers should play a role in educating young people on the proper use of social media. Others feel that the task of teaching teens how to conduct themselves online is the parents’ responsibility. Personally, I think the teens are already much more knowledgeable about the latest social media platforms than their parents or teachers do. Since teachers and parents are collectively using social media much less frequently and much differently than younger users, how much value would there be in the curriculum that the teachers and/or the parents produce?

Will a focus on teaching social media draw focus away from other important school subjects?

Middle school is a crucial period of development for students to learn how to be independent, how to manage their time, and how to be responsible for multiple projects at once. Adding a whole new curriculum of social media instruction could potentially drive students to spend a disproportionate amount of time on social media “studies” as compared to their other traditional school subjects, such as reading and math. Also, will social media classes become an elective option similar to a band/orchestra class or foreign language? And if so, might students lose interest in these extra-curricular activities simply to spend more time online?

How could a state-mandated school curriculum possibly keep up with the rapidly changing nature of social media?

The most popular social media networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) have only been around for about ten years, and a number of others have been around for even less time. This means that even the people who have been on these social platforms since their inception have only had a decade or less of experience using them. This lack of experienced users, combined with the ever-changing nature of social media, could make it quite difficult for any person or group of people to come up with a general, all-encompassing curriculum surrounding best practices on social media that can easily remain up to date. How often would the curriculum need to be revised to include the latest social platform or most recent viral online incident?

At this point, it seems a bit early to tell how the introduction of social media education will play out in schools. However, the passing of the bill (among other things) is a clear indicator that social media is here to stay, and people need to pay attention to it. Many organizations (corporations, non-profits, etc.) are requiring their employees and team members to go through social media training, illustrating how to professionally represent their organization on the Internet. Many companies also have elected to establish a social media department to manage the company’s online presence.

It’s safe to say that social media is going to play a significant role in how both seasoned professionals and young people interact, and the time to start getting educated about social media is now.

What do you think? Should social media be taught in schools?

Halloween Dad,"Year seven of Dad’s Halloween experiment saw even more extravagances than years gone by. Jeneanne and Dad got married a year before and spent three weeks in Bermuda that May. Jeneanne loved Dad’s Halloween spirit and Dad loved Jeneanne.

Better still, Jeneanne was a Christmas Freak. Not a Jesus Freak, but a Christmas F-R-E-A-K. When she and Dad bought a house in the Summer after their wedding, one of her biggest demands was space for all her “Christmas Cheer”. Between her decorations and Dad’s, the attic, basement and garage rafters were all packed for the holidays. They barely had room to store their winter and summer clothes, and they used to joke about letting us sleep outside so they could take our rooms.

There were a few surprises in year seven. Alethia died that New Years and both Mom and Lonnie were broken up about it. Alethia was the only person in my life who had died up to that point. I didn’t have much time with her but she loved me and I loved her. Dad and Jeneanne talked to Mom and Lonnie a few weeks after the funeral to ask if I’d been as funky at home as I had been with them. Mom got worried, as this was not Dad’s M.O. Dad overlooked things and always saw the bright side.

But the cloud over me didn’t seem to lift. Eventually, they put me in kid’s therapy with “Dr. Dave”. Nobody seemed to be okay with how sad I was. I was fine with it. It passed, in time, and I can’t speak to Dr. Dave’s contributions except that he recommended I give Adderall a try.

Three weeks in, I stopped eating and I was pulling out my eyebrow hairs. Mom and Dad were both in firm agreement that I go off of it.

I was thirteen. I started feeling sad about things other than Alethia. I was angry and hungry and horny all the time. Dad and I were still “best pals”, but he seemed to be shorter with me than he ever had before. He was always on me about homework and my grades, even though I kept a 3.5 GPA. He would always tell me how important school was.

“Must be, or they wouldn’t make me go by law,” I said to him on the drive one day.

“You can take that mouth back to your mom’s house, because I don’t have room for it here,” he snapped back.

He felt bad about it by the time we got to the drop-off.

Dad and Jeneanne got started with their Halloween planning in August that year. They talked to my uncle Gary about their exterior wiring and they started using LED bulbs that didn’t draw as much current. Jeneanne was really good at painting yard decorations and keeping the peace between Dad and I. When September came, Dad asked me and my brother what we wanted to be for Halloween. My brother said “Power Rangers” as he had for years and years. I decided to really shake things up.

“I wanna do wolfman.”

Dad’s eyes twinkled. He started looking up videos on the Internet about how to make realistic fangs out of wax and how to use spirit gum to attach fake hair to my ears. He even thought about contacts with yellow irises but talked himself out of it when he saw the cost. He bought plenty of fake blood, though.

I ripped up a few old flannel shirts and an old pair of Lonnie’s khakis. Mom said she was too freaked out by the test-runs of the costume to even bother looking at me night-of. She managed to keep her composure for a few pictures anyway. Lonnie thought I was, his words, “really cool looking.”

I stepped out of the house with my black claws and face paint and fake hair and fangs and I turned to Mom and Lonnie and asked if I could go out on my own this year. They didn’t think that was a great idea.

My brother and I hit all the regular houses and finally got to Dad’s. Mom and Lonnie headed home to chill, only stopping to have a cup of coffee and a piece of apple pie with Jeneanne inside. My brother started tearing off his costume and immediately started gorging himself on candy. Jeneanne grabbed the camcorder and started taping him. “Oh my gosh,” she kept saying and laughed along with him. She worried that he was choking on a lemonhead but he quickly corrected himself and she kept on chuckling at him.

Dad was staked out front. Literally staked, as he was pretending to be a dying vampire that year, lying in the big black plywood coffin. The kids went nuts, between him and the cauldron and the Frankenstein with the light-up eyes. There were big fake bats swinging around on the branches outside, emitting their tinny “OoooooOooOooo” noises. Shrieks of horror poured out of the MP3 player Dad kept specifically for Halloween sounds.

A lapse in candy-seekers came about 9:30 and Dad excused himself into the house to go to the bathroom. Jeneanne was still recording my brother, who by now was doing crazy dances to the “Monster Mash.” I was fiddling with my fangs when Dad turned the corner and took a deep breath.

“Did you tell the boys yet?”

Jeneanne seemed thrown off. My brother quit dancing.

“…no,” she said, startled.

“You didn’t tell them you’re gonna have a baby?”

My brother’s eyes lit up. Jeneanne was stunned and embarrassed, but happy. Dad was beaming.

My chest felt hot. I had to get up.

I ran to the bathroom, Dad grabbing at me as I went by. I threw up and it melted the wax off my canines. Nobody heard me over the “Monster Mash” and my brother shouting “Baby sister! Baby sister!”

My tears ran hot as I rinsed my mouth out. I pulled off as much of the hair as I could and scrubbed off the make-up and stripped off the shredded clothes. My fingernails were still black and there was some of Mom’s mascara in my eyes.

I stumbled out of the bathroom and Dad and Jeneanne were both waiting for me in the living room.

“Are you okay, honey?” Jeneanne asked.

“I’m fine. I think I ate too much sugar,” I said. It wasn’t strictly a lie.

Dad rubbed his palm on my forehead, hunting for a fever. I didn’t fight him but I wanted to.

“You feel a little hot,” he said. “Want a bottle of water?”

I nodded. He ran to the kitchen and Jeneanne sat me in the rocker and pulled the lever to elevate my feet. My ears were still ringing.

How could they be having a baby? Dad’s so old and my brother and I were still so young. Jeneanne was trying to wrangle my brother off of the couch and into bed, a nigh-impossible feat at this time of night with this much sugar in play.

Dad got me a bottle of water and snapped it open with a flick. I started to guzzle it but Dad warned me about being too hard on my stomach. He sat in the quiet, Jeneanne in the background trying in vane to get my brother to quit jabbering about nothing.

“Are you okay?”

“I’m fine,” I said.

“I know this is kinda shocking news,” Dad said, reading my mind. “Believe me, it’s just as shocking for me, too.”

I didn’t say anything.

“Isn’t it great that you’re gonna be a big brother again?”

I shrugged. Dad realized he was playing a losing game so he finally turned off the porch light, the first official act of the dismantling of Halloween.

“I think we’ve done enough for this year. It’s gonna be hard enough getting your brother to sleep.” He went around the corner, turned off the sound system and started hitting his well-planned surge protector switches with his foot to slow down and silence his nightmare garden.

I drank the rest of my bottled water, went back to the bathroom to scrub off a little more of the leftover makeup, then put on my pajamas for bed.

I waited until the night was dark, no longer polluted with the pale green-and-purple light of Dad’s handiwork. I heard Dad come in and chat with Jeneanne for a bit.

“I think he just got overheated,” Jeneanne said.

“I don’t think he took the news well.”

“It’s probably just a shock for him. He’s going through so much already…”

“He should be happy! Right?” Dad couldn’t figure out why I was so disappointed or angry or whatever I was.

When I reflect on it now, I think it was halfway between jealousy and anger. Dad wasn’t satisfied with my brother and I? He wanted a kid he could keep all the time? Hey, news flash, you shouldn’t have left us with Mom. Maybe then you’d have your kids around you every day.

Those kids would get the full Dad treatment, all the time. He’d be “Halloween Dad” all year long. Happy Dad, excited Dad. And we’d get the leftovers on the weekends.

Over time, I’d mature a bit and learn to love my baby sister, and not even bother with the term “half-sister”. I love her the way I love her baby sister, the way I love the baby brother that Mom and Lonnie would eventually have, Mom’s “miracle” baby she gave birth to during my first week of college.

But in that moment, I didn’t see the possibility of love anywhere around me. I felt dark inside. I saw the posters in my room and the light under the door. I watched it get dimmer and dimmer and finally die.

And I waited.

Eventually, a full, bright moon came rising. There, in the dark of my room, four square panels of soft, beautiful light rolled across the floor, centimeters at a time. Soft, chirpy snores rolled out of my brother’s door, left open just a crack. Dad and Jeneanne’s bedroom door was closed. There was no AC on, no heat — the house was well-insulated and had been warming up all evening with the heat of bodies and a fire in the hearth. I was perfectly content in my skin so I slipped off my shirt and yanked off my socks. I was there, bathed in moonlight from the window, cutting a strong-looking silhouette. I felt perfect. Perfect, and mean.

I went to the closet and pulled out the baseball bat Dad and Jeneanne bought me for making Honor Roll the year before. I whisked myself down the stairs, armed, dangerous, quiet as the shadow that laid long in front of me. I unlocked the front door and stood there, somewhat tall and somewhat muscular, tears hot behind my eyelids. But I didn’t cry.

I walked up to the wolfman, the same one that had petrified me for years, and I stood in front of him, bat slung over my shoulder. I hated the wolfman. I hated him. He was always my least favorite. Of course he was, look at him, all stupid and ugly and useless. I let the bat slide down my palm until the butt of it rested on the bottom of my fist. I hauled back and whacked the wolfman right in the jaw. Styrofoam and fake fur flew. With one clean hit, I had knocked the jaw off his stupid, shitty face. Ha ha, wolfman, you’re nothing now. Can’t bite someone like this, can you, you piece of shit. I hit him in the arms and knocked off a few of his fingers. I hit his legs and he crumpled down to the yard, his menacing claws now bent up toward me in a plea for mercy. No mercy. I’m killing wolf men tonight, which isn’t very lucky for you.

I beat the wolfman senseless. Unsatisfied, I went after a few of the jack-o-lantern’s. Bam, boom, bam, right down the line, the careful curves of the gourds splitting and crumbling under the bat. I kicked a few of the fake styrofoam tombstones over. I punched the mummy in the nuts, or where I thought his nuts might be. I laughed to myself, not too loud, but in a way that sounded hideous when I reflected on those moments years later. I stood in the yard, heaving, out of breath, the maker of untold destruction. I took a turn around to view my handywork. There was my dad’s masterpiece, in tatters on the ground. Spray paint, duct tape, glue, glitter, all of it garbage now.

I plodded back up the stairs, sweaty now, even in the cold. I ran my hands through my hot, thick hair and wiped my nose where my sleeve would’ve been. I looked across the porch — there was another figure, black in the shade of the porch, motionless. I decided I would spare the Dracula dummy. He was pretty cool, after all. There, there’s all the mercy you’ll have tonight, I thought to myself. I’m not good enough for you, well, now all this shit’s not good enough, either.

I went back to my bedroom and stashed the bat back in the closet. I laid in bed, shirtless, sweaty, my nose full of night air and my hands raw from the bat and the beatings. I breathed heavily and I fell into a deep sleep. I barely budged until the morning, when I heard my brother crying.

“They broke it?! They broke it?!”

I woke in a daze and stumbled over to my shirt, still crumpled on the ground, and threw it on. The morning was cold and the heat of the house had all flown out the door with my dad and my then-youngest brother.

I looked out of the living room window. It all seemed so much worse in the daylight. There were feathers and fur and cardboard and splintered wood…it looked like a tornado had ripped up and ruined everything around us.

Dad wasn’t yelling or anything, but there was a purpose and silence in his work that made my brother turn right around and not bother Dad with his many questions and comments. Jeneanne was on the phone when I woke up and ditched the call quickly when she saw me.

“Honey, are you okay? Did you hear anything last night?”

I looked at her, dumbfounded. I don’t even think I was playing dumb in that moment — I think I was truly ignorant about the goings-on and my role in them.

She ran over and gave me a hug. “I’m sorry, sweetie. I know this is you and your dad’s favorite thing.”

My heart felt like she had tied a lead sinker to it. This was what Dad and I did, once upon a time. Coming up with these crazy Halloween ideas. Executing them with what little we had. When Dad had nothing, he had Halloween.

Now, he had nothing again.

Jeneanne told me it would be okay. If she knew anything about what I’d done, she didn’t let on. She just got back on the phone with her mom after scuttling my brother into the kitchen for his cereal.

I took a few timid steps outside to the porch. I looked around at the devastation and I looked at Dad. I looked around for Dracula on the porch.

But Dracula wasn’t on the porch. His coffin was out in the yard, but…

Why would Dad move Dracula after the fact? He wouldn’t. Who would’ve put Dracula on the porch while I was out there tearing up everything? No one did.

We didn’t use the Dracula dummy this year. Dad dressed up as Dracula, with the stake through the heart…

I’ll never know for sure, but I think Dad must’ve followed me downstairs that night. He crept behind me, quieter than I was, maybe even holding his breath. He watched me do one of the worst things I had ever done in my life, in perfect quiet, from the safety of the porch. I don’t know, to this day, why he didn’t stop me.

There have been times when I hoped it wasn’t him, but a serial killer, biding his time, holding off from making his move because of the moonlight and the proximity to the house. Deep down, I know who it was. And I know what he thought as I wrecked years of hard work, work that he and I had done together. Now, he was shoving all his ghouls and ghosts into contractor bags. I stood watching, helpless.

“You gonna get down here, give me a hand?” he said without turning around. I felt all my blood turn cold, like he was holding me in thrall. The only heat in my body was in my ears and under my neck, the shame of what I’d done compelling me to go down into the yard and help Dad bag trash.

How to Think About All Strategic Alliances — The Right Mindset and How to Make the Tough Decisions,"Strategic Alliances

In the quest to build a business, alliances are key to growing quickly and building robustly. Partners with expertise, distribution, or resources that you don’t have create a huge advantage over competitors.

We’ll take a broad look at partnerships: 1) a high-level view of the healthy mindset to carry into an alliance, and 2) strategic insights for choosing the best partners and executing well on those agreements.

But First — A Companion Collection

Before we get into the goods, check out and bookmark (or better, pocket) James Cohane’s Guide to Business Development & Partnerships. He’s collected and categorized a great set of resources for those who want to go deeper into the when and how of partnerships. Huge thanks to Joe Mecca and Edson Rigonatti for sharing this awesome collection.

It’s a great follow-up to the high-level approach we’ll take here, and makes it easy to dive in by section if you’re looking for help on a particular topic.

The Mindset of Strategic Alliances

Most partnerships end in failure. They fizzle, underperform, or blow up — only the minority deliver expected (or unexpectedly positive) results to all parties.

The reasons for these failures are the interesting part. Most often, the trouble begins as a failure of mindset — one or more partners comes to the table with an attitude that sets a course for future disaster.

This is corroborated by research done by Larraine Segil, who wrote a great column in Forbes about how to avoid failures of Strategic Alliances.

My research into over 200 companies at Caltech, where I teach executive education in alliances, found that cultural incompatibility (whether differing company size, corporate culture, management personalities or national cultural differences) caused alliance failure more often than the business or financial considerations.

In order to create successful partnerships, cultivate the correct mindset — and be certain that your potential partners have done the same.

Serve Customers, Then Find Partners

Most partnership decisions begin by thinking ‘Who has what I need?’ then trying to get it. That default mindset is (clearly) not the right approach.

Leyla Seka, who runs Desk.com (now part of Salesforce) believes in approaching partnerships by thinking about whose Customers you can create the most value for. In this 30-minute talk hosted by Saastr [which was suggested by Rob McGrorty] she goes into the foundation required for healthy, beneficial partnerships:

You should be seeking mutual benefit, and it’s much easier to achieve that when you know you can deliver value for a partner.

To find out whether you can deliver value for the partner — focus on their customers. Do you (demonstrably) create something that their customers use and appreciate — and hopefully already pay for?

Have an attitude of service partnership

Everyone has made a failed run into a partnership with the ‘They-have-what-I-need’ mindset. Brad Feld has a great short post [suggested by Itamar Goldminz] where he talks about his experiences with start-ups attempting partnerships with big companies, which so often ended in failure.

He eventually learned that this was a failure of mindset, and easily fixable:

I decided I was thinking about it completely wrong. I came to these conversations wondering what the big company could do. Sure, I considered the skills and capabilities of the startup, but I was always trying to figure out and anticipate how the big company could help the startup. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

If you assume the big company has no fundamental obligations to a startup, you can’t get hurt too badly.

This realization was a turning point for his approach to partnerships. What it really comes down to (though Feld never states it explicitly) is understanding and empathy.

It’s crucial to realize that partners are stakeholders in the partnership, not in your company. They will be (and should be) focused on their own agenda, and completely indifferent to your agenda.

I realized that was a consistent pattern in my world. Large companies have whatever agenda they have. They have no responsibility to the small company beyond whatever legal contract exists, which often is heavily weighted in favor of the large company. Strategies change. Executives change. The macro changes. Exogenous forces, that the small company can do absolutely nothing about, regularly cause havoc for the large company. Instead of expecting something from the big company, you should be focusing on doing specific things that help the big company while advancing your goal as a small company.

Never expect special treatment. Don’t expect them to go out of their way for you. Have enough empathy for their situation to appreciate that there are forces at work that you may never know about, that affect your partnership.

This is the core reason that partnerships can be so risky — you’re not in control (and sometimes not even informed) of all of the variables that can affect the longevity and quality of the partnership.

If you only read one thing — read this

Ray Stern is a veteran of big business partnerships and strategy. As a Senior Vice President at both Yahoo! and Intuit, creating and managing partnerships was a big part of his background. When he recommends a resource, you read it. Probably a couple times.

He suggested Simple Rules for Making Alliances Work, from the Harvard Business Review. This article is full of high-level wisdom and some very tactical advice, so no matter what business or type of partnership you’re considering, there will be something valuable in it for you.

The parts that seems most interesting (and counterintuitive) to me were about 1) the importance of openly discussing differences of culture — actually airing gripes about process and performance:

A turning point came when some alliance executives began systematically documenting differences between the companies and then held working sessions with team members to discuss how those differences were being perceived and whether they might benefit the alliance if they weren’t ignored or suppressed. Because many of the differences touched on sensitive issues concerning competencies and culture, people were initially reluctant to address them, preferring to focus on imagined or desired commonality. When the teams finally overcame their reluctance, frustration that had built up over many months came pouring out, and perceptions of each other were often expressed in negative or even inflammatory language. Over time, though, the partners were better able to view each other’s qualities in a positive light.

and 2) how important it is to take an extremely broad view of who the stakeholders are and will be in the partnership, and have the foresight to include them in the plans from the beginning:

Though eminently reasonable, the conventional advice — to serve the partnership at all costs — is insufficient. Equally important, and often more difficult, is maintaining commitment from and alignment among the business units and functions (finance, legal, R&D, sales) in your own company that are affected by the alliance or on whose contributions its success depends. Companies are not monolithic, yet alliance advice tends to gloss over this basic reality and treat partners as if they were simple, homogeneous entities. Although most counsel on alliances highlights the fundamental importance of trust, it rarely delves into what our research and experience indicate are the biggest barriers to trust: mixed messages, broken commitments, and unpredictable, inconsistent behavior from different segments of a partner organization.

More Wisdom on Partnerships from Ray Stern

Through a lifetime of building partnerships at companies of all sizes, Ray has developed a sound Partnership Philosophy that he’s been willing to share with us.

This one slide is the blueprint to crafting any kind of partnership, from small business up through the Fortune 500. Each word is carefully chosen and none of these points can afford to be skipped.

Directly from the desk of Ray Stern

Any time you find yourself approaching a potential partnership, or evaluating one — return to this set of fundamentals to ensure that your strategic alliance will have a sound foundation, and a chance for success.

Strategic Decisions about Partnerships

One of the tough things about these kind of partnerships is that decisions constantly have to be made, re-considered, and re-made again. It’s in their nature to have moving pieces, and be affected by a huge number of variables (known and unknown) that continually affect changes to the circumstances of the partnership.

It’s helpful to have some guiding ideas on how to think about these alliances, and what strategies you can approach them with.

When to seek an Alliance

The most basic choice to make here isn’t who to ally with — it’s when. The stage you’re at will determine the kind of partners who will make good fits. As a company looking to create a new capacity (in some way — a product, offering, service, etc) your three options are: Build, Buy, or Ally.

We can see the basic decision inputs here, thanks to a slide taken from this presentation by Cisco, suggested by Itamar Goldminz.

The Switchback Strategy

Partnership isn’t a marriage. It doesn’t have to be a more perfect union, ‘til death do you part. Alliances exist only as long as strategic value exists and goals are aligned. Many companies are now partners who competed in the past — and many companies who partnered together are competitors today.

This is a strategy that has been studied by researchers at Wharton, dubbed the Switchback Strategy, where companies temporarily either cooperate or compete with companies that it expects and hopes to have the opposite relationship with in the future.

Here is the full academic paper about Strategic Switchbacks, and a much more user-friendly article that sums up the information nicely. Thanks to Karan Khandpur for suggesting these!

Here is an interesting excerpt on the temporary cooperation strategy:

Start-ups that want to sell directly to their customers but do not have the supporting infrastructure such as marketing and distribution can adopt the temporary cooperation switchback strategy. […] In the partnership, the start-up learns from the corporation how to market its product. Eventually, the goal is to break free and go directly to customers. However, start-ups have to be smart in the way they execute a temporary cooperation switchback strategy. It is important to ensure that the agreement with the partner is structured in a way that the start-up can learn from the experience.

And the temporary competition strategy:

Start-ups that are having a tough time finding a bigger partner to license their technology or through whom they could sell their products might wish to consider going to market themselves — at first. This is what Hsu and Marx call the temporary competition switchback: Compete in the market to prove the worth and usefulness of the product or technology as a way to get a future licensing deal or strategic alliance. This strategy would work for start-ups facing skepticism from potential partners, which arise because the most valuable applications for the technology are not clear, could not be measured or because an industry standard has not yet emerged.

The Perfect Case Study: Disney & Pixar

One of the most popular cases from Harvard Business School on the topic of Partnerships explores the strategic relationship between Disney & Pixar. You’ll learn a lot from this short read about how their partnership developed, and the tough decisions that needed to be made as it evolved.

They’ve had a fascinating relationship — working together closely at times, negotiating hard, and learning huge amounts from each other through their cooperation. Here’s a great example of the attitude that Steve Jobs (then at Pixar) brought to the thinking about this partnership:

This three-picture deal resulted in the 1995 hit film Toy Story, directed by Lasseter, which garnered more than $350 million in box office and video sales, making it the highest-grossing film released in the United States that year. Yet from 1995-1998, Pixar earned only $56 million in revenue. When asked if he had regrets about inking the deal, Jobs said, “None, no. we’re working with the best in the business and we’re learning a lot. We call it going to Disney University.”

You may notice some similar elements to the ‘temporary cooperation’ strategy we just saw in the study from Wharton. As Pixar was a young company, it relied almost entirely on Disney’s promotion and distribution engine to spread the brilliant productions that Pixar knew it could create.

Reading about the development of their partnership and the strategic moves from the perspective of the decision-makers is fascinating, and it’s also super cool to read about the logistics behind the production of some of your favorite movies. Highly recommend the Disney & Pixar Case Study.

Regarding Gumpaste and Gumbrushes,"The dental industry needs to rebrand and make everything gum focused rather than tooth focused. Yes, having good teeth is important, but having healthy gums is equally or more important. We grow up being told to brush our teeth twice a day with our toothbrushes and our toothpaste. This sends the wrong signal and ingrains this tooth-centric attitude in us from a very young age. As we get older, we learn that it’s really all about the gums. Receding gums and gum disease are the issues that result in painful surgeries and other bad stuff.

Highlight this sentence if you think the dental industry should change their lingo and start calling toothbrushes “gumbrushes” and toothpaste “gumpaste” and that we should be telling our kids to “brush their gums.”

Highlight this sentence if you think I’m cuckoo.

Fuck Me Mindless,"You straddle my shoulders, aligning your balls to my mouth. I’m dizzy with your smell and automatically start painting your balls with my tongue making them dripping wet. I look up to see you’ve got a firm grip on your cock and you’re stroking, pulling your balls up, and grinding down as I suck one and then the other, then both. My mouth is full and I swirl my tongue and gently suck, my eyes locking with yours.

You push up to release your balls from my mouth and I whimper and fight to keep them, but you win and they release with a pop. You run your now wet sack all over my mouth, cheeks and nose, then move down a little so you’re straddling my chest and roughly grab and pinch my hard nipples, positioning my tits and nuzzling your hard black cock between them.

Looking down into my blue eyes, you make a carnal sound before you prepare my chest by spitting on it so you can easily slide your cock between my tits.

My pussy is so hot and wet. Reaching down I rub my clit, just like the way you taught me to, the way that makes my pussy soaking wet, you love to watch and listen to how wet I get. I am perfectly sensitive and needy.

I tuck my neck down and open my mouth waiting, I need to taste you. You stroke up and thrust between my tits right into my hot, wet, waiting mouth. I align the rhythm of my moans so that your cock slides through my tits and hits the back of my throat. You moan against my humming vibrations.

I can’t stand how hot you look, the noises were making, the pressure on my tits. You’re fucking my throat, and it’s amazing. You’re moaning and thrusting and telling me “You’re gonna get all this cum, where do you want it Nia? Fucking, tell me where you want it?” you demand.

I can’t think. I can’t talk. I am so turned on. I’m concentrating on too many things at once. I look into your eyes with need and I know instantly that you’re going to cum.

I clamp down on your cock as it hits my throat again deep. You’re fucking my mouth fast and hard as your cum gushes into my waiting mouth. I swallow fast and cum hard as my fingers speed across my clit in a frenzy.

You withdraw stroking my hair, that sexy smirk I’ll never tire of, decorates your face. You leant in kissing me, you know how crazy it makes me when you taste yourself in a kiss. I moan against your mouth. Our bodies glisten with a sheen of perspiration.

You leave my mouth to suck my nipples hard, biting and nipping them, kissing my neck. I feel cherished and used and needy again.

“You need to cum again? Maybe I’ll make you my precious little slut?” you tease.

You know my body so well and slide a finger inside me, feeling how much my pussy needs your cock buried deep, how it clenches against your finger, pretending it’s your cock and attempting to milk you dry with my tightness.

You tell me to hold my pussy lips open so you can watch my hard little clit dance while you try to add another finger into my tight sensitive puss.

I moan and squirm around your long fingers begging for more, but you torture me staying perfectly still, except for scissoring your two fingers trying to make room for one more.

Your fingers are burning hot inside me and dripping wet, you slowly withdraw all three fingers and then with a corkscrew motion you quickly shove them deep inside. When you’re buried as far as you can go you wiggle your middle finger against my G-spot for a count of three and then slowly slide out of me.

I am loosing my mind, you’re keeping me on the cusp of a huge orgasm and its fucking torture.

“You’re not allowed to cum yet Nia” you tell me “I won’t let you cum until it’s my dick buried even further inside of you. I want to feel you cum all over my big cock” all the while pushing me closer and closer by slapping my poor sensitive clit with your cock.

I’m begging you so pretty, to “please…please let me cum on your cock. “Please shove it deep inside me so I can cum all over you” I beg. I need you so bad tears are streaming down my face from trying so hard to hold back.

You love watching me suffer in pleasure, begging for release. You wish you could keep it up, but you can’t wait to bury yourself inside me.

You suddenly slide your fingers out and slide your cock in as fast and hard as you can, pushing as deep as you can go, making me scream.

You can’t believe how fucking tight and hot my pussy feels, your toes curl as it takes everything inside you to glide your big fat cock out of me slowly, until just the head, is nuzzled inside. You feel my pussy gripping you trying desperately not to let you leave me.

“that’s right baby, you wanna cum all over the tip of this big cock?” you ask me “you going to thank me for this cock with your cum?” you taunt.

When you reach up and pull and pinch on my hard nipples my hand automatically goes to my clit and I rub so hard. When you feel the beginning of my orgasm you slide in and fuck me hard and fast against the convulsions of my orgasm and my pussy squirts all over you. My cheeks burn with heady addictive release and borderline shame, that only comes from letting you own my pleasure so completely.

You repeat this three times — loving how I can’t stop cumming how each orgasm builds, ebbs, brakes and builds again.

But you demand more. You pull out suddenly until it’s just the tip again.

“you want more of this dick baby” you groan “then you know what I need from you. Tell me what I want to hear.” You demand.

I don’t miss a beat because I need you so badly.

“Fuck my ass I whimper, please fuck my ass hard”. You don’t hesitate and slide your dripping wet cock right into my ass. I’d let you do anything to my body in this state, I’m overwhelmed by how dirty, hot and sexy you always make me feel.

It’s so tight you don’t make it more than 4 strokes until you’re filling my ass with your hot cum. It feels amazing, a soothing balm that pushes me over then instantly calms me as I gently float back down to earth.

You collapse on top of me, still buried deep enjoying the aftershocks of my weak, limp body.

United People. Buckminster Fuller was a strong…,"United People

A New Human Operating System

The Heart of the Problem

Buckminster Fuller was a strong believer in the power of design to revolutionize our world. He believed that bright minds would come up with increasingly efficient and cheap solutions that would shift our world towards a more people centered and egalitarian society based around the principle that we inhabit a common Spaceship and as such our destinies are inextricably linked. Bucky felt that better design was the only thing that could change the world because he believed changing people on any large scale was an insurmountable task. He was certain that a design revolution would take place in his lifetime. He was wrong.

Buckminster Fuller

The reason he was wrong was because he neglected to account for the fact that the things we design and put into the world originate within the minds of the people. As long as these people operate within the current system, the designs and inventions will fit and perpetuate the current system. Great ideas do not become realities in our society unless they have a profit incentive, unless they entice investors, unless they prove their worth as defined by our system’s values. Same thinking, same solutions.

Albert Einstein

Albert Einstein understood this when he wrote “The release of atom power has changed everything except our way of thinking… the solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind.”

Without changing the heart you won’t change the output.

The Operating System

An Operating System (OS) is a core set of code that determines what is possible and not possible to do on a device. Only programs which are compatible with the OS can run on the device.

We normally think of an Operating System as a purely computer related term reserved for the likes of Windows, iOS, and Linux, but what if we took this concept and applied it to people? Don’t we also have operating systems that determine how and what we think? How we interpret and process stimuli and information? A set of basic principles that allow us to make sense of the world around us and inform how we operate within it?

The code that we use for our Human operating systems does not come pre-installed or on a floppy disc. Instead we are gradually programmed from an early age by the code we are surrounded by in our lives. By the time we are grown, we are not even aware of the fact that we have been programmed to be this way.

Religion, government, economics, nationality, family, economic structures, social conventions all contribute to making up our systems. Religion often being the longest standing and thus most influential of the systems. While religions have evolved over the years, they are still based on human knowledge from centuries or millenia ago.

They were adopted because they created stability, trust, purpose and community in a time where the world around us was often filled with mystery and uncertainty. Skip ahead 2000 years and the problems we face as a society and a planet are quite different. The advancements in science, technology, travel, and communication have transformed the world around us, but our internal OSes have not advanced at the same pace.

We are overdue for an update.

Isn’t Science the New OS?

Free thinkers who were watching the Scientific Revolution take place were convinced that the days of religion were numbered. They were certain that with science bringing ever-increasing knowledge of the world around us people would no longer have the need for their old superstitions and religion would fade into oblivion. Clearly they under-estimated how engrained religion and its practices are in the human psyche.

Four hundred years later and you would have to say that religion is still a significant force on our human experience.

As much as science has answered, it has also left un-answered. People striving to find meaning in their lives tend to find them in churches, temples, and mosques, not in science journals.

Science is not enough.

Can’t Erase, Must Replace

People will not let go of the branch they are holding until they have a new branch to grab onto. So if we want to move beyond our current stage we need to create a new system for people to adopt. One that offers a narrative and principles that are more applicable than the current default. One that aligns itself better to the context of the 21st century.

Since we do not have the benefit of direct heavenly inspiration we will have to take our pointers from the world around us. So what does the world tell us? What do we as people tell ourselves? Who will we choose to be our teachers and guides?

What have we discovered through millennia of social experimentation in the realms of religion, philosophy, art, music, politics, and technology? If we were to create a remix of all this wisdom to best prepare the next generation, what would this look like?

Our Current System (Alpha)

If we think of humanity as a software program, then the portion of our existence up to this stage can be seen as an Alpha stage. We went from caves to skyscrapers using more or less the same parameters to push this evolution:

“Winner takes all”

“Might is right”

Male

Dominant

Nationalist

Racist

Violent

Regressive

Mono-

α

Our New System (Beta)

If you accept the concept of Human Operating Systems it can seem depressing, because the systems currently in place are firmly entrenched and will be difficult to uproot. However there is also freedom in this concept, because it states that so much of what isn’t working in the world is not due to our nature, but rather our programming. This leaves us with an opportunity. Each of us can choose to change our programming, and in the process we can change the world.

People are already exemplifying and living the new Beta values in pockets around the world.

The new paradigm looks like this:

“We’re all in this together”

“Sharing is caring”

Bi-gender

Communal

Global

Pluralist

Loving

Peaceful

Progressive

Poly-

β

Utopia or Oblivion

We are faced with a world that is rapidly spinning out of control. The window for humanity to rise up and face our challenges head-on is closing. If we do not manage to self-correct soon we will reach a tipping point beyond which there will be no chance to preserve the naturally occurring processes of our Spaceship. Are we willing to accept an ocean without fish? A land without flowers and bees? We either rise UP together or fall down alone. The choice is before us. We either step UP to the next level in our evolution or we risk losing everything we’ve accomplished so far.

Imagination

A major blockage we face when trying to solve our problems comes from our thinking being limited to the parameters of our current system. The solutions we come up with are rooted in the rules of the status quo. If we want to come up with new solutions we need to first outline the new world we wish to create. Only once we have a clear vision of how we as humans want to live and interact can we start building towards that idea. We must use our imaginations to dream up a new worldview. Once that is clear, the paths that will take us there will become visible to us all.

Components of a New Operating System

A new system will need at least the following components to be successful:

Identity — We need a clear brand that people can identify and associate with Historical Recontextualization — We need to re-interpret our history to get a clearer view of our current place in evolution Purpose — Setting the intention for change Principles — Clear first principles to use as guides for our choices Practice — Instructions for implementing the system upgrade on an individual and group level Community — Tools for connecting people who are walking the same path Communication — Spreading the message of this new worldview to the rest of the system

1. Identity

Until we clearly identify who we are and what we stand for, we can’t expect others to see us and join us. The progressive portion of our society lacks a clear message and a unifying identity. We throw around words like liberal, progressive, leftist, freethinker, socially conscious global citizens, eco warriors, atheists — words that no longer point to anything. They are empty at best, and at worst they have become synonymous with lost causes and well meaning intentions that fail to produce results. Being labeled a liberal in American politics is tantamount to admitting irrelevance in the national dialogue.

If we are to compete in the marketplace of ideas, then we need to rebrand ourselves. We need to declare to the world what we stand for, why we stand for it, and what we’re going to do about it. We need to create a brand that draws new recruits to our cause. One that speaks with a clear voice, and with deep conviction. A brand that stands for something instead of just against something.

2. Historical Background

Part of the current problem is how we view ourselves. We have been told who and how we are by marketers, psychoanalysts, priests, and politicians. We are all told the same stories of kings and conquests, gods and pests. Amidst all the dates and the details we’ve lost track of what was actually happening. We need new lenses through which we can see ourselves and gain a new understanding of the journey we are on. How did we become these people? Where did we start and where are we headed? If we ignore battle dates and body counts, and instead focus on how humanity as a whole has unfolded, what can we learn about our tendencies? How can we evolve past the traits that are holding us back? Who do we hope to become in the future?

3. Purpose

Once we understand ourselves and our moment in history we need to define our purpose. Far too few people ever ask themselves what their purpose is… fewer still come up with an answer. Most of us walk around on auto-pilot, repeating the purpose we’ve been sold — “Keep working so you can survive. Keep consuming to make you “happy”. Take care of yourself and your own, let others worry about themselves. ”

On and on we march with empty purpose, and we wonder why we feel like our lives lack meaning. Its because we haven’t put any meaning into our lives. We haven’t chosen a purpose to drive our life and actions. For a lot of people the deepest core variable that determines their actions, has been left undefined. An <empty field> in their Operating System.

It is for each of us to find our specific purpose. However there are clues as to what our purpose could be. Something that throughout philosophy and religion is touted as the one thing that works time and time again — Service. If you want to feel meaningful, be of service to someone other than yourself.

4. Principles

There is a reason the ten commandments are so powerful, and its not the power of their content, it is the power of the concept. Namely that there is a set of core principles to revert to when you are faced with difficult moral choices. A grounding set of code that enables us to make decisions in times of difficulty. Having clearly defined principles is a method for problem solving and acting. They allow us to understand what aligns with our nature and what will serve us in the impact we wish to have on this world. Each person will have their own set of principles that resonate with their experience, but we can easily express a set of principles that most people aspire to UPhold.

5. Practice

Deliberate Change comes from Purpose and Practice. Deciding what to be is one thing, but actually being it is another. Day in and day out. Change is hard, but it is possible. We need to teach ourselves how to turn our principles into action through our daily lives. A lot of human technology for how to go about this already exists, it just needs to be distilled and presented so people have easy entry points once they are activated to change.

6. Community

Discovering people who are walking the same path is an enriching and empowering experience. Too often we are not shining our beacons bright enough for other people to see the path we are walking. Once we know how to identify ourselves, we will find each other, and in so doing we will find power and voice in community. We will discover that there are more of us than we thought, and that when we walk together on the path our light illuminates further and wider than when we were separate, and it will lead others to walk beside us.

7. Communication

If we want this worldview to have an impact in the current paradigm, its ideas must be packaged in the language of the times and distributed far and wide. Only by creating clear and emotionally persuasive communication can we reach those that are not yet aware of a different path.

The People Need a Union

By walking this path we accept the role we’ve played in perpetuating the established system. We choose to work on ourselves so that we may change our repetitions, thus helping others change theirs.

We acknowledge that we have an active part to play in shaping the world around us.

How we integrated Talko calling & conferencing into Slack channels,"Slack is a wonderful communications tool. We use it every day at Talko, as do some of our customers who frequently work at their desks. Those customers asked us to better integrate their team communications by bring Talko’s mobile calling and conferencing capabilities to Slack. So we did.

You can read more about the scenarios for our Slack integration here. You can also sign up to be a beta user — we’d love to have you! In this post, we give an overview of Slack APIs that can be used for building integrations and talk about how we implemented our scenarios.

Slack APIs

Slack provides a number of integration APIs. Webhooks offer the simplest mechanism to consume or post information from/into Slack.

Incoming webhooks allow an external service to post into Slack with a simple HTTP request. Want to enable your users to see information about your service in Slack? Incoming webhooks is a great place to start. Examples include Airbrake (error reporting service), PagerDuty (alarming service), Jira (issue tracking service) and many other reporting services.

Outgoing webhooks are used to send a limited set of information to one or more external URLs and optionally post back a response into Slack. This allows Slack users to interact with your service from right inside the Slack client. However, there is one important caveat: outgoing webhooks are limited to public channels and can’t be triggered from private groups or direct messages. The way around this limitation is to use a slash command integration, which works across all types of Slack channels. Examples include Hangouts, Appear.in, Giphy and many more.

In addition to incoming and outgoing webhooks, Slack provides a much richer interaction using their Real Time Messaging API and Web API. The Real Time Messaging API is a Websocket interface that provides events for activity in Slack and the ability to post messages as the user. It serves as the basis of the Slack clients and bot integrations. The Web API provides access to the Slack data model: channels, users, team, chat, etc.

Talko integration

Our goal was to enable users to initiate Talko calls and team conferences from public channels, private groups and direct messages in Slack. Since we were triggering a call from Slack, we started with outgoing webhooks. However, to support the scenarios in private groups and direct messages, we needed to move to slash command integration. When a user types the slash command, it sends limited metadata about the Slack user, channel and team. In addition to this metadata, the Talko service needs each user’s email address so that we can match to a Talko account and ring all channel members. We use the Web API to get that information.

Initiate a Talko call from Slack: The slash command sends a request to the Talko service with the slack team_domain, channel_id, channel_name and user_id parameters. The Talko service stores these parameters and responds back with a message containing a link for creating the Talko call. The link contains the key which the Talko service can use to retrieve the slash command parameters.

Slash command: /talko sends request to Talko service. Talko service responds with a link to start a new Talko call.

Create the Talko call with a label: When the user opens the link, the Talko service gets the slack channel_id and user_id it had stored earlier and uses the Slack Web API to get emails for members of the channel. The channel members’ email addresses are used to find each user’s Talko account and initiate a call to their Talko iOS app.

Clicking Ring initiates a call and routes it to all channel members’ iOS Talko client.

Post back message with link to the Talko call in Slack: The contents of a Talko call don’t go away once the call ends. Live calls are saved and available in Talko to make it easy to organize, find, replay and share key moments. To make the calls available right from Slack, we post back a message with a link to the call in the channel using the Web API.

Talko service posts a link visible to all channel members to enter the call in Talko web client.

Authorization

When a user hits “Start a new Talko call in this channel” link, the Talko service needs to make Web API calls to get channel membership details to ring the Talko app. These Web API calls require an access token. Slack uses OAuth2 to seek user consent before granting this access token. The Talko service redirects the user to the Slack OAuth page where the user can grant or deny permission. On getting a user response, Slack gives the Talko service a short lived code to request the access token.

Slack OAuth page

Here are a few helpful hints for working with the authorization process.

Repeated authorization induces click fatigue. To ensure a smooth user experience, we cache the access token after the user has authorized the Talko integration for the first time. A single user with multiple teams in Slack is a fairly common usage pattern. Since the access token is scoped to a user in a team, multiple access tokens need to be cached. Instead of storing the user’s access token on the service, we decided to store the token as a cookie on the client. This ensures that a potential attack on our service doesn’t compromise the user’s Slack account.

Thats a brief overview of how we built the Talko integration for Slack. Get Talko and sign up to try out the Slack integration. We hope you’ll like it as much as we do — please let us know what you think.

So it was kind of memorising 20 plus new juzu’ and revising back the other 9 during these 4 months. I am also not having any commitments other than birrul walidain(doing good to parents) hehe. But by Allah, those who have the intention and desire to memorise the Qur’an for Allah, He will make it easy for you insyaAllah. This is, from my experience.

Below are my tips ;

1- Purify your intentions.

This is the utmost important point that one should always be mindful of, do it sincerely for the sake of Allah. Hoping for His mercy, obtaining His pleasure & attain Jannah(paradise). Not for the sake of exams, friends, families or showing off(riya’) wal iyyahu min zalik, we seek refuge from Allah from it.

“Allah only accepts actions that are intended purely for His pleasure.”(an-Nisa’i) May Allah keep our intentions purely for Him.

2- Start, now.

No, don’t procrastinate. Your intention won’t be any stronger a month from now. Make time for yourself. Don’t make excuse for yourself. I know some people, who have the intention, but doesn’t have the motivation. To me, therein lies the source of motivation: think of the benefits – you’ll gain so much – the rewards for reciting every huruf(letters), beautiful beautiful verses & stories you’ll come across(!!!). Take your Qur’an after your solah. InsyaAllah you’ll get the momentum from there on.

3- Use the same mushaf.

I had used the same mushaf(book ; Qur’an) since 14. This is the advice that usually my asatizah(teachers) gave, reason is, when you use the same mushaf, your eyes are accustomed to the way it’s written in the book, colours, decorations etc, thus makes the mind accustomed to it insyaAllah.

4- Listen to the Qur’an recitations.

This may be hard, but may Allah make it easy for you ; let go your songs, music, pop, rock. Two opposites cannot coexist with each other. Of course, there are different opinions on this matter. But would you rather listen to music than listening the Qur’an recitation that is said to calm and soothes one’s heart? (13:28)

• I would listen to the Qur’an recitation of the surah that i am currently memorising or the next surah, repeating it while doing my stuff. The words will enter your mind subconsciously. You will find memorising the surah (chapter) easier insyaAllah. I would also open my mushaf and listen to the Qur’an recitation of the surah to get used to the pages – then begin memorising.

5- Repetition and division of page are foundations to memorising.

Read the whole page a few times, you can choose to divide the page into three or two parts. This depends on how easy and manageable you find the page is. Memorise the first part before proceeding on to the next part. Avoid going to the next part before first ensuring that you’ve gotten the first part stored in your memory, strong and intact.

6- Understanding is key to memorising.

It gives you pleasure understanding what He is conveying. By Allah, I find the Qur’an very beautiful, it can get you to your lowest point and open you to the greatest change. Focus on what you are reading to understand the verse. Not thinking about other stuff whilst repeatedly reading it.

Download a translation/tafseer app of the Qur’an in your phone. Or some may use the mushaf that has translation at the side. My ustazah(may Allah give her goodness) always advice us that understanding is half answering the question. So in this context, understanding is half memorising the verse insyaAllah.

7- Start slow.

Take small steps one at a time, insyaAllah you’ll find being consistent easier.

8- Don’t give up.

Doesn’t mean it seems hard to you right now, it will remain hard tomorrow, make your du’a before begin your hifz(memorisation) Remember that where you are now(in memorising), is a step closer to finish the Qur’an, don’t stop. Just keep moving. (This applies to everything else as well in whatever you’re pursuing/doing insyaAllah)

9- Have a friend that wants to memorise the Qur’an too.

It helps to keep each other motivated by sharing how much you have memorized and revised.

10- Make a plan.

So basically, mine was, memorising 4-6 pages in a day. Memorising a page took me around 30mins+/-. It depends on the difficulty of the page. Some pages, Allah made it easy for me alhamdulillah. So it took me around 20mins to memorised it. There were quite a number of pages that has verses that i’ve learned/memorised in school and that itself made it easy for me. Subjects like fiqh(Islamic law), Aqeedah(islamic belief) and so on. Whereas pages that were difficult took me around 45mins.

11- The best time,

to memorise Qur’an is after subh or fajr prayer when the mind is fresh. Something about fajr feels easy to enter your mind. The serenity of fajr. My ustazs(may Allah give them goodness) constantly advise us to be productive in the morning, as illustrated by the prophet صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم in a hadeeth “O Allaah, bless my ummah in the mornings.” (by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah)

After prayer times is always best to do your hifz(memorisation). The period between maghrib and isya’ is nice, fill up the time making by memorising.

12- Be productive.

Read the Qur’an on your way to school/work etc in the train/bus. Personally, most of the time, i like taking the train more than driving, as the journey time can be spent being productive, hifz or revising.

13- Carry your mushaf wherever you go.

It will set as a reminder to read it insyaAllah.

14- Take care of your eyes.

…. From gazing, staring at the opposite gender’s ‘aurah(parts of men/women’s body that should be covered). Your ears from listening to gossip. Your mouth from backbiting, saying things that may create fitan (falsehood) and from all acts that are forbidden. Again my ustazah(may Allah reward her) advise us, and asked to memorise Imam Syafi’ie ‘s poem(in arabic) in our heart to set as a reminder.

I complained to Wakii’(Imam Syafi’ie ‘s teacher) about my poor memory He advised me to abstain from sinful acts And he told me that knowledge is light And the light of Allah will not be a guidance for a sinner

“A man asked Maalik ibn Anas, ‘O Abu ‘Abd-Allaah! Is there anything that will improve my memory?’ He said, ‘If anything will improve it, it is giving up sin.”

15- Make tawbah.

Seek forgiveness always, sometimes we commit a sin without even being conscious of it. Should one fell, one should hasten in repenting to Allah. He accepts the repentance to those who sincerely repents insyaAllah.

• “And, indeed, I, (Allah) am most certainly forgiving to he who repents and believes and does good deeds and is, then, rightly guided.” (20:82) (وَإِنِّى لَغَفَّارٌ لِّمَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا ثُمَّ ٱهْتَدَىٰ)

16- Have someone to listen to your memorisation ; tasmii’.

Have a friend, family member or a teacher to make your tasmii’ to. This person should be someone who knows how to recite Qur’an properly, so that he/she can catch your small mistakes that often happens.

17- Muraja’ah (revising) what you have memorised.

Have someone to listen to your muraja’ah(revision). One should hold onto his hifz by revising it constantly.

“Commit yourselves to the Qur’an, by the one in Whose Hand is my soul, it is faster in slipping away than a tied camel.“ (Agreed upon)

We are after all Insaan(humans) It is human nature to be forgetful, as the Arab poet said “He is only called insaan because of his forgetfulness (nasiyaan), and it is only called the heart (al-qalb) because it changes so rapidly (yataqallib).”

18- Eat raisins & honey.

Not quite sure about the details, but i’ve been taught it helps to improve your memory insyaAllah.

19- Make night prayer.

Make at least two raka’ah. Just start with two raka’ah prayer and make du’a. It will help insyaAllah.

In a beautiful hadeeth the prophet صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم said “Our Lord descends every night to the Earth’s sky when the last third of the night begins. He says: “Is there any supplicant for Me to answer them? Is there any seeker of My Favor so that I will give them? Is there any seeker of forgiveness so that I will forgive them?” (agreed upon)

“The du’a made at tahajjud is like an arrow which does not miss its target” – Imam Syafi’ie

20- Du’a. Always, seek for Allah’s help.

Don’t underestimate the power of du’a. It’s amazing to see how great du’a really is.

The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said; “Verily your Lord is Generous and Shy. If His servant raises his hands to Him (in supplication) He becomes shy to return them empty.”(Ahmad, Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi)

• Call unto Me, I will answer you. (40:60) ( ۚ وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ٱدْعُونِىٓ أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ)

• I answer the supplicant when he calls upon Me (2:186) (أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ ٱلدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ)

Know that there is nothing more dearer to Allah than a servant making du’a to Him.(Tirmidhi) So ask Allah to make your mind and heart easy for you to memorise His words. Ask Him to strengthen your memory to remember and not to forget what you have memorised, some people have difficulties in memorsing, they find it hard to remember and forget easily, ask Allah to strengthen it. Ask Allah to remove your laziness.

21- Make du’a for others.

During the times you are making du’a for yourself, include others in your du’a as well, for, they might in need of Allah’s blessings. Anyway, you might also benefit from it.

“The dua of a Muslim for his brother (in Islam) in his absence is readily accepted, an angel is appointed to his side, whenever he makes a beneficial dua for his brother the appointed angel says “aameen and may you also be blessed with the same.”(Muslim)

22- Ask your parents to make du’a for you.

When I started memorising the Qur’an in the first month, I told my mum my intention & asked my parents to make du’a for me. It helps a lot.

“The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said; Three supplications will not be rejected by Allah, the supplication of the parent for his child, one who is fasting & the traveler.” (al-Bayhaqi, at-Tirmidhi)

That’s all, i hope it helps/benefits in any way even if it’s a little. I still have a lot of muraja’ah to do. Please make du’a for me. May Allah make it easy for you in memorising/revising the Qur’an. May Allah ease our affairs. Special thanks to my friends for supporting! <3

Florence: Day 1. First day in Florence we had some great…,"Gelato at Venchi’s

We were trying to find a good gelato place and we came across Venchi’s which we thought was the one we were thinking of (started with a V). The gelato was super good. My niece dropped her cone and it was a quintessential “kid dropping their ice cream” moment — where they kind of stare at it with pouty face ready to cry. One of the workers saw what happened and gave her a new gelato on the house. How nice!

We learned later that this wasn’t the right place, it was actually Vivaldi, but Venchi’s was also one of the top gelato places in Florence. You’ll have to wait to see what we crowned the king of gelato.

Ponte Vecchio

After eating our gelato we wanted to go back and see the Ponte Vecchio which is the bridge slash market connecting the two banks of Florence. It’s a really cool bridge that has a jewelry market during the day. In the evening it’s bustling with tourists trying to take photos of the two banks and the surrounding hills of Florence.

Palazzo Pitti

We crossed the Ponte Vecchio and rested in a large plaza called Palazzo Pitti, which marks the entry into the Boboli gardens. We sat there for a spell and then decided we were all tired and should go to bed. It was a pretty full half day!",https://medium.com/aix-in-florence/aix-in-florence-day-1-fe09986f53cd,['Aix Squared'],2015-07-12 15:43:51.208000+00:00,"['World', 'Travel', 'Italy']"
For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When Popeye’s Chicken Was Enuf,"I couldn’t even make it past the drive-through window at Popeye’s without being recognized.

“Are you that lady?”

I almost didn’t hear her, but she said it again. This second time she grew more confident and spoke a little louder and the question was enough to shake me out of the mopey daze I’d been in since my life had begun to crumble away from me.

“Are you that lady on the news?”

She was smiling and serious about getting an answer. Much more serious about that than getting me my wings and biscuit.

This woman intended to hold me hostage with her gaze and my chicken in her hand until her curiosity was satisfied. As I became more focused on the confrontation, I recognized the mean smile behind her eyes and the stupid grin on her face. They both said she knew exactly who I was before she asked. The whole question-answer bullshit was merely a formality.

“Chicken Girl” only wanted me to answer so she could laugh in my face.

Then she’d ask me the questions that hadn’t been addressed on TV, especially since every news outlet had a different accounting of what happened, all of them sensationalizing an eccentric story, but none of them reporting the truth.

I really couldn’t believe that any of this was happening. I had driven through this Popeye’s virtually every night for most of three years before going home after my daily commute. It was conveniently close to my home and always open, but this was the first time anyone ever attempted to engage me in conversation about anything other than chicken. Quite frankly, no one ever even made eye contact. . .

Until now.

Every night, I pulled up to the speaker and said, “Give me three wings, mash, no gravy, and a biscuit. No drink.”

The speaker replied, “Pull around for your total.”

I’d pull around, pay, grab my chicken, and go home, eating my meal quietly right before laying back, conking out, and then coming to consciousness the next morning. Just so I could do it all again. But like everything in my world, things had somehow changed, even at Popeye’s.

In this moment, the chicken girl was acting as if she was someone to whom I was accountable and she was waiting on me to humiliate myself in one of three ways:

One, by being ashamed.

I could burn rubber and get the hell away from Popeye’s and she’d laugh and tell her friends, maybe even post it on social media.

Two, by lying.

I could say I wasn’t that lady when we both knew I was the one in the mugshot, even if the story wasn’t true. Then she’d laugh, tell her friends and still post it somewhere on social media.

Or…

Three, by conceding my identity.

I could admit who I was, defend my innocence, giving the chicken girl an exclusive she’d be sure to laugh about before posting it on social media and telling all her friends.

Although I found the entire exchange tasteless and inappropriate on her part, I thought it was an opportunity to regain my footing. I mean, I had been hiding out in my house for days. It had now been two weeks since the story first hit the media and spread like wildfire and in that time I’d even had a reporter knocking on my door while the camera man tried setting up his equipment so he could get an angle on my humble little house. Of course I watched from an ever so slightly raised corner of a venetian blind I had taken ten minutes to painstakingly situate to avoid detection.

I stayed indoors as long as I could before I had to venture out to restock my groceries and supplies, but because I feared another public shaming at the grocery store, I had opted for drive-ins where I could make my order and receive my food with a fast get-away as many times as I needed until things blew over for me.",https://medium.com/thsppl/for-colored-girls-who-contemplated-suicide-when-popeye-s-chicken-was-enuf-d74c819b1083,['Emjay Em'],2015-11-04 19:34:47.610000+00:00,"['Short Stories', 'Autobiography', 'Personal Essay']"
How Radio Changed The World,"For just 5 years short of a century, radio has shaped and advanced society like nothing that came before it. Radio has changed the way we communicate with each other, how we share and promote our thoughts, opinions and creations — but not just that; at times, your radio is your companion: loyal and enlightening, ever prepared to share music with you or give you the latest headlines.

But before it was an everyday household item, before it was a diverse multi-frequency platform for communicating and advertising products to consumers around the world, before it became everybody’s ready and willing roadtrip partner, radio technology was simply a spectrum, a myriad almost purely theoretical frequencies that science believed could be utilised for faster and more convenient communication.

Science was right of course, and the world hasn’t been the same since. It’s almost a kind of magic if you think about it.

“radio became an invaluable means of communicating”

From there, radio evolved into a steadfast means of communication for pilots, ship captains, truck drivers, law enforcement, emergency services and many more. It later developed into a vibrant addition to households and, during World War II, when radio became an invaluable means of communicating breaking developments on the warfront, people around the world would sit beside their home radios and await the news with bated breath. Radio was even used to broadcast information to the underground resistance movements in France, Belgium and Denmark in the ‘40s.

Yes, radio changed the world in many ways — almost too many to count — the most important being the rapid sharing of information. In a way, radio was almost a foreshadowing of the Internet technologies that followed.

Tea Eggs,"Thirty years later he had returned back to Shanghai, and had become one of the city’s millions of migrant workers, who lived with four other men in a cramped, airless dorm and who could not afford to marry. Day and night he pushed his large black pot to the same street corner, selling tea eggs and occasionally soy milk and fried dough sticks. And he waited.

One evening as the sun was setting, he was sitting in his bamboo chair with a pipe billowing thin blue strands when he came across a photograph in the daily paper. The city had announced its newly appointed directors within the municipal government, and the photo showed two rows of tightly packed middle-aged men in suits and waning smiles standing before a flowing red silk drape. Large black block letters stuck on a white banner contrasted with the blood red to announce “Congratulations to the Newest Members of the Municipality!”

He peered closer at the photograph. It was him, even before he read the caption. Gao Shun, his childhood friend, stared back at him from the second row. Gao Shun was still tall, but had lost his skinny frame and boyish good looks. He had thinning hair and a wry smile, and his belly protruded against the buttons on his white shirt.

He didn't know how long he had been staring at the photograph, but it seemed an eternity until a soft, feminine voice awoke him from his trance.

“Two tea eggs please.”

He looked up and caught the fluttering edge of a shimmering, turquoise dress wrapped inside a black wool coat. Two half-moon eyes smiled back at him under a layer of mascara. Dark red, salon-ready hair surrounded her well made up face.

Next to her stood a man, and he had to rub his eyes to make sure he was seeing clearly. It was as though the photograph he had just seen transplanted itself onto the very being in front of him. Tall, imposing, with thinning hair a protruding belly against his jacket. No smile this time, though.

It was his friend Gao Shun, now a newly appointed member of the municipal government, standing before him.

He was about to utter a cry of joy, but as the man’s eyes turned toward him his throat closed and he felt the air sucked out from his lungs by his cold, steely stare.

“Well, what are you waiting for. She said two tea eggs.”

The face that looked at him was Gao Shun’s, but it did not give the slightest hint of recognition. He could see now the face was pudgy, waxy, almost like someone had smeared a layer of clay onto human skin to create an eerily lifelike yet inhuman mask.

Slowly, he unfurled the skinny brown fingers of his left hand, all the while keeping his gaze on Gao Shun, who had already started reaching for his phone. The hand that dropped two coins into his palm was fleshy and white, clammy like wet dough. One of the fingers wore a large black ring with an emblem, and reminded him of a rotten turnip.

He reached for the ladle, dipping it into the hot black tea and raising it to reveal two steamy tea eggs. His right hand shook so badly that one of the eggs nearly plummeted to the ground. He steadied himself, and finally passed the plastic bag to the lady’s outstretched gloved hands.

“Thank you.”

He mumbled a “You’re welcome,” but they were already walking down the street.

He eyes followed them as they disappeared into the busy street, then crumpled into his chair.

He didn't even recognize me. He thought, and repeated these words as they tunneled into him. That sick knot was back again inside him, a black spade scooping him out, scraping inside his stomach walls, carving through his muscles and crunching into his bones. His body was hot but a cold sweat clouded over his brows, and involuntarily he felt his knuckles turn white as he dug his hands into the bamboo armrests, not feeling the prickly vines pressing into his palms, creating patterns of small cell blocks stacked on top of one another.

Again a voice awoke him, this time a male’s. It sounded tired and feeble.

“Could I have a tea egg please.”

He didn't even glance up at the man. In a dream-like state he reached for the ladle and doled out the egg in the plastic bag. He didn’t see, but heard, the man peel the egg right then and there and shoved the whole egg into his mouth in one bite. It was only when the man began to walk away that he jolted to alertness.

“Hey! You didn't pay!”

The man began to run. He grabbed the ladle by the pot and started chasing after him. The man made it fifty yards down the street, tripped on a curb and fell into a flowerbed. He caught up and was standing over the man as he struggled to get up.

And that’s when he raised the silver ladle with both his hands over his head, and brought it down upon the man’s head with a heavy thud.

The man uttered a cry and wrapped his arms around his head.

He raised the ladle and brought it back down again. And again. And again. It struck the man’s shoulders, neck, back, hitting the spine and the connective tissues that held together the bones. He felt himself strike vertebrae after vertebrae, and as the man’s cries died down to a whimper, he felt released within him a potent force of savagery and sweetness, coursing through his veins like an eel and electrifying him.

At last he stopped, out of breath, and looked at the man by his feet. The man was on his stomach and had wedged himself between two pink flower bushes, whose petals now scattered like thin fingernails. He reached into the man’s pockets. Empty.

He turned the man over. The street lamp above him shone directly onto him and for the first time, he could see. The man still blocked his face with his arm, but he could see that he was well dressed, or at least he was once. The stained, smelly brown suit with tattered edges was made of fine wool. His pockets, now turned inside out, were stitched and lined with gray silk. His shoes were leather, though dusty and beaten, with creases and tears around the edges. The man had soot under his fingers and had been wearing a pair of thin framed glasses, which now lay broken by his head.

He could see the blood running down the man’s nostrils into his yellowed teeth. Slowly he reached over and pulled the man’s arm away from his face.

Beneath the pale lamp was a dirt ridden face with a swollen lip. Sunk deep into the hollows of his sockets were two eyes that looked — frozen — like marbles on the bottom of a fishtank. They were not round nor terrified with fear. There were no tears in them. They didn’t even move. They were simply there, two oculii with no light that let in only defeat and darkness, ashes from embers that had died a long, long time ago.

The man whispered without looking at him: “I’m sorry. Please don’t hurt me anymore.”

The city came to a halt and a wave of nausea washed over him. He turned away and retched into the pavement. As his head slowly cleared, behind him the city sped up again. He realized people were walking around to avoid them. As the wind blew on him, he realized he was soaked in sweat and shuddered.

He ran back down the street and, like a maniac, began to scoop out dozens of tea eggs into layered plastic bags. The scorching hot tea burned his fingers, but he didn’t care. When one bag filled full he started another, until there were no more tea eggs left in the pot. Then he ran back to the man, who was still sitting among the flower patches, and handed him the bags of glistening tea eggs.

“Here. Take it. Take all of it.”

He left the uncomprehending man sitting among the scattered petals in the crescent of light cast by the lamp. Less than a minute later he was back to where he was, next to the bamboo chair, tending to the pot now devoid of eggs. It was dark already, but if the lamp from the street lamp could turn just a little, any passerby would have seen a man bent over a large, black pot, weeping, his large teardrops tumbling into the black ink of the simmering tea leaves below.",https://humanparts.medium.com/tea-eggs-a34e52354069,['Minyang Jiang'],2015-02-24 22:45:53.552000+00:00,"['Short Story', 'Fiction', 'Short Fiction']"
How I was Saved,"People always talk of a ‘Come to Jesus’ moment. This is mine.

I came to the hard truth that I’ve never truly had a relationship with Jesus. I was always under the illusion that your relationship with Jesus is relative to your relationship with Church. It is not. It is deeply personal. Below is my story, that I’ve been prompted to share with a wider audience. He wants my story to effect and save others.

This past weekend I went on an expedition called Man Camp with my church, Crossroads. Prior to the initial sign up I set my alarm for 5:50 AM so that I might get signed up and go, but like a boy I delayed my awake time a half hour after the sign ups and signed up for the wait list. Looking back on this I think God intended for me to instead be on this specific trip, with the Wolf Pack I was assigned to. What happened this past weekend was amazing, liberating and life changing!

I went into the experience only expecting to meet some guys and get to know some new people. What I got instead was a walloping from Christ. He absolutely singled me out and he let me know he was all in if I was as well.

Thus my journey began on finding someone from M*A*S*H* to talk to. The M*A*S*H* group was a group of prayer warriors, there specifically for people to reach out to. I searched out, only to see them continuously redeeming other souls and hearing “now is not the time”. So I kept walking from our camp site to the barn, back and forth. Finally I was staring into our fire and thought “If I continue down the path I’m on, this is what waits for me”. I walked back up to the Barn, continuing my search.

After the end of an event I saw Michael walking away from the side Barn doors and introduced myself. Michael grabbed Steve and we talked. I opened up to these two strangers about my problems with Lust addiction and how I always heard Glenn Beck say that “these are other men’s daughters, would you want some other man to treat your daughter like this” which always hit me hard because I have a daughter of my own. That I’ve tried for years to beat this on my own, only to be sucked back in.

We talked some more and they helped me hear what God wanted me to say and so we prayed. In that prayer I asked for Jesus’s help in combating the addiction. I asked him to save me. This was beyond powerful and drove me to tears. I cannot be more thankful to Michael and Steve, they truly are warriors for Christ.

The most powerful moment came later that night, when my group was sharing during our Challenge Coin time. It can only be described as the most epic 2 hour campfire talk ever. We all opened up, and prayed together. Most of all, I opened up completely to these 11 strangers and laid all of this out for them as well. I had already shared earlier that I had been saved, this was me describing to them what I’ve been saved from. My Wolf Pack surrounded me, laid hands on me and prayed over me. I was absolutely driven to tears of joy.

While handing out our coins our group leader gave each of us a word of encouragement. To me he said “Darren, I think you know what you need to do”. Some may have seen this as underwhelming, but it was the most powerful thing he could have said to me. It was like Jesus was screaming at me, telling me to just listen to Him.

After arriving home on Sunday I had some time to reflect on everything that happened. I was still pretty overwhelmed by the whole thing and I was thinking on what I’d always heard Glenn Beck say and at that moment I heard “Those are God’s daughters”. This was a powerful revelation that brought me to my knees and to tears.

I am absolutely beyond grateful for these men and this experience. I’m excited to have been saved and continue on from THAT point to live for Jesus. I cannot wait to see what He has planned.",https://medium.com/founder-s-keepers/how-i-was-saved-d70a930fd289,['Darren Hertenstein'],2015-03-30 14:44:04.431000+00:00,"['Christianity', 'Jesus', 'Saved']"

More Bread for the Baking,"It’s an unusually cool day in central Mozambique, and the neutral-colored sky is threatening to rain. 54-year-old Tencia sits next to the small crackling fire she’s built underneath the overhang on the side of her home.

Atop the fire sits a charred metal pot, and it’s quiet enough that all of us can hear the lid rattle as steam fights to escape from inside. The sweet, tangy smell of banana bread has just started to permeate the air.

My stomach groans.

I check my watch again. It’s been exactly 52 minutes since the bread-making process began, but I have no idea how long it will take for the bread to finish. Only Tencia knows.

Our attention shifts to three chickens circling a mixing bowl on the ground in front of the house, attempting to steal away the scraps of banana peel. Jeremias, Tencia’s oldest son, gets up to shoo the chickens away, but she smiles and motions to leave them be.

As the chickens run off with their prizes, Tencia looks out proudly toward the field beyond her house. Perhaps tired from the sunrise church service, she contentedly closes her eyes for a few minutes.",https://medium.com/charity-water/more-bread-for-the-baking-cff67702f525,['Charity'],2015-02-24 17:45:06.398000+00:00,"['Africa', 'Business', 'Clean Water']"

Say the bones are saved with the help of thousands of hands. From deep furrows of callused dirt, and the folded scuffle of dactyl-roots — the rummage that grips what others forsake. What goes away never stays away and returns just as the day turns a rabbit out from the thicket. From beneath the silt and soil — the amniotic muck — the souls of things arrive grimy and breathing.

Out of the darkness in the field — that distant hollow flanked by dusk — where there should only have been corn, a birch caught the breeze and quickened with the gusts.

Where the clearing hand had stopped — where the farmer said enough of what I need — the remaining stand held on from where they’d seen their group pared back.

Start with a path worn by walking, then horses, then cut and fit for a road, then some structures (clapboard mostly). Where squatters were they stayed and built.

# # #

When the road was still rut and dirt, and no neighbor was near, a farmer built a house, a barn, cleared more land, planted some crops. A boy paused to jump and pull at birch branches. Say the seeds move with the help of thousands of hands.

When the farmer’s family was gone the townspeople speculated. They offended a higher spirit. They got what they deserved. It’s just a damn shame.

The house was untouched. Everything in its place. The lever on the pump rested half-cocked. Wood waited to be seasoned and stacked. A half set of mail-order china in the cabinet. The girls’ clothes folded in dressers.

A boy paused, but came looking to play with Emily. From the porch he called, once, twice. He pulled a chair holding the pantry door and found the dog. He took a step into the living room. The floor was stained red to brown in a long uneven swath.

Relatives came and took what could be. The girls’ clothes for cousins. The china for an aunt. The wood stove and a pair of Holsteins auctioned. A boy kept the dog, To ease what he’d seen.

Years of this build and tear down. Say never anything resembling a church, though not much is needed to sing a hymn or kneel and pray.

# # #

Reading on the porch steps all afternoon is a prayer; and plowing the fields — sweat is some kind of providence. When you’re thirsty dishwater is as good as holywater — it is a certain belief.

A turning, a winding on a particularly dangerous stretch of Berkshire backroad. She smiles, points to some birch trees, Do you think they feel pain? Down through the drift they drive in the mind-set of the maple-man as bloodletter. The trees stand in pale bottom nakedness, their yellow pants swept around their ankles.

Early September. Some boys from town dared each other to go in. The rooms emptied. The water turned off at the well. The boys threw stones through windows. Weeds were tall where firewood had been strewn in the yard. The cats turned feral. Corn massed in the field then rotted where it rose. Mice multiplied.

Margaret and Emily played in the kitchen while their father planted lilac bushes. One for each side of the porch steps. One for each of them. They could hear the shovel piling dirt in soft falls. Emily went through the picture book and stopped to point at the duck-billed platypus and elephant as proof. The priest may never talk about it, but God is an awfully funny guy.

# # #

Say the bones are forgotten; the birch now whiter than fog over the field that was always a field even when what grew was from no discernable hand.

When the field was a home of birch on just this spot. And hence? A team of oxen? A John Deere engine? An ax thwack?

Just a damn shame, for something to be put away, that it’s not yours unless you’ve broken it, until it’s lost its novelty, its newness.

The warranty seems to have been thrown out with the box, but that’s simply the cost of business with handshakes.

# # #

Margaret said anyone would be funny if they had an infinite sense of humor, and infinite laughter, and an infinite audience. If she was infinite, Margaret hesitated, maybe Thomas Boyle would like her. Emily made a face at the mention of the Boyle boy, but was curious.

Not the platypus, not the boy, nothing seemed as funny to Emily as the drawing of icebergs. What nonsense, a piece of ice the size of a house and built in the middle of nowhere for no reason.

The sisters agreed, it was hard to distinguish between when God is laughing with you and when God is laughing at you. Emily wanted to ask her father, but Margaret said she shouldn’t. God may be funny, but when you ever hear him laugh? Daddy wouldn’t know anyway.

Where the road left the one-bar, one-store, one-school towns, there was smooth asphalt for people who had to get through without stopping. Do you wonder if they care to know anything different? Within the keepings of brevity they go by a dirty child playing on the side of the road.

That first winter snow edged through broken windows and drifted down the entranceway from room to room. Room to room, white as bone that sits in a corner all day then rises suddenly and shifts as if an unmerciful tantrum. From one storm a few birch trees fell from the weight, and in the spring remained uncleared in the field.

# # #

The bones that hold skin in place are no lovelier than sinews that root and grasp mud and stones — anything really — placed here or there for no particular reason.

For what is a brick but a big toe? What is a floor but walking?

Say the paradigm of heaven is nonsense. God gets around; he even sleeps with the ugly ones.

What is a building but a stand-and-stare with the eyes of windows? What are the joist and collar beams but bones?

Unheard, secure with nonsense, a chanting in tongues. A bone used to beat a drum.

What is the nebula but the knowledge and soul of an unbelievable fairytale?

There are ways of believing that go beyond the senses. Tonight someone is dancing.

# # #

This is not moldering. This is gathered and saved once for the turning, once for returning. A break in the bend of a tree line — a path made to walk.

Margaret sat on the porch steps knitting all afternoon. Emily played with the dog and half-listened to her mother read to her father from a week-old paper. Say what she heard was, The body of the vortex was miles to the southwest, but the winds were enough to lift the eave of the roof.

Emily stopped playing. The winds were enough to lift the eave of the roof and spread an odd shadow across the kitchen floor. The dog pushes his nose at her hand, but she heard, Outside three decades of cottonwoods wretched then snapped as if torn by a giant unseen fist.

Her mother said — the dog half-listened — and what she heard — One child seized a locket from her bedroom; one child gazed at the barnyard full of panic-stricken animals; one child yelled for the dog.

Her mother said, and Emily heard — From across the kitchen floor one stared in denial at her mother; one took her face into her hands silently and cried.

Newspaper got the wood-stove going. The girls help their mother with dinner.

# # #

They whispered in their room long after bedtime. Emily’s mind shuddered when her sister said, God may not even be the name of God.

After Margaret fell asleep the moon hunched sideways through the tops of trees and Emily thought no name was better than another — if she got sick of saying God she would say Hank, or Herb, or Hannah.

The autumnal woods whip by on either side of the road. The fractured light through the branches frames something for her eyes. You see those lilac bushes? There must have been a house there. Lilac doesn’t grow wild like that.

Between the wind and snow the birch trees had to ease what they could and heaped upon one another. They pointed oddly away from where they stood — limbs torn and twisted. The shadow of where they stood was still a shadow for an other. Not birch, but shadow. Not birch, but let them think they’re sleeping in the ether. What they were was limp with faces to the ground — hiding something on the underside — bodies piled without much care.

Not a lullaby. Say a hard-coming fairytale.

# # #

God loves (and loves and loves) even the ugly things. Hank puts on his best shirt. Hannah wears perfume. Tonight they will make a little music. Tonight the floorboards will clap to their dancing.

Herb would rather make a mess than do nothing. He digs a hole, stops, digs another, and another. He goes to the landing, half-listens, shakes himself dry, warms under the eave, becomes bored — returns to the refuse, puddles, and muck.

Nothing is lonelier than someone who loves all the time. Hannah is never weary of the world or tired of teaching.

There is fire in the mind, in the unbroken breath. Have patience, you’ll feel it.

…loves a mess, and loves disorder. Like you, Hank also loves the rain on the roof, and church spires in the distance. Why put limits on love? Sometimes all it takes is the thump of boots on a boarded floor.

Sometimes, the mud split ripe and cleaved into the sole.

# # #

A honeybee’s handiwork elegantly chants in tongues.

Man was formed from the dust of the Earth is what Emily heard the priest say, and she pushed her hands into the soil to see.

If Hannah was going to send her only son to Earth again could he come as a honeybee? Because why not? Mind your own bee’s wax.

At the edge of the cornfield Margaret pulled flowers. Always some soul grimy and breathing. Bloodroot for spring. She smelled their perfume. Emily pictured blood held the flowers in place.

When she heard Emily she went to see, What are you laughing at? Emily smiled, turned her hand over, and let loose her hold so dirt could sift loose and return.

No one believes as anyone else believes. And since the house is forgotten, instead say save the lilac for some child.

# # #

Stop me if you’ve heard this one.

The girls’ aunt came to visit when she was almost seven months pregnant. Emily sat silent most of the afternoon cyclically reaching out to touch her stomach. Be patient, you’ll feel it.

So one birch says to another birch. . .

The farmer took on a hand from Douglas who one night killed the family and buried them under the floorboards. Nobody knew why except that he loved and loved one daughter.

He stood over Emily as she slept. He watched her rummage slightly before he broke open her neck with a blade her mother used for digging.

White you are.

# # #

Say in the wilderness — hear voices or hold a deaf ear to the dead.

Early June. Emily walked with the dog on large stones across the low stream. From her mother the girl knew the rocks had been there a long time.

On one side of the bank were birch trees. Fits of sunlight and high grass filled the space between. Among the grass was a whole congregation of flowers. Emily called them grassflowers.

Grassflowers grew in patches. Where they ended was pasture fence. Hank liked to Keep things in. Keep things out. She sat a long time. Distantly, flanked by dusk, the farmhand watched.

Herb liked not to say much, or say nothing.

Emily sat with her feet in the water. She would slide them in, watched her ankles go orderless, and break at odd angles below the surface. She would pull them back so the light would mend them. The dog sat panting.

# # #

The sky was turning a translucent purple. Hannah spilled wine on a light blue tablecloth. Hank took off his work clothes, and on his back was the sky bruised but healing. Emily was not supposed to be this far from the house. Herb sniffed at the skin of a plum and knew it was all light underneath.

Emily tried to fathom the gift as her mother termed it. Bleeding where it’s not natural. Every month? Emily’s mother worried and wrote to her sister.

Herb can love and be loved…

They rise up and down through the mountains with birds rising and drifting. She realizes she may one day forget all she had said; for there are certain mannerisms and moments, certain turns wound and stretched around, certain stretches of road that carry bones, and every twist is a stitch, every bump rides and holds.

Sulking home, every time Emily looked the sky turned different. Before the wash of pitch — Hank’s hand mired in engine oil — there was a moment of sepia. Hannah forgets to leave the bedroom door open just a crack.

The farmhand remained where it was easy to watch and not be watched.

# # #

Emily turned toward the bend where the path emptied into the field. Once houselights returned to her it would be too late for the farmhand.

In one motion she heard the dog take off through the woods yelping and was spun down hard into the crook of an exposed root.

The farmhand said, shush and shush and it’s okay, and holds his hand over her mouth.

His breath returning to her face. Emily tried to say, Herb, Herb.

The farmhand believed. Emily took off running …where it’s not natural. Hands live with true or false depending on how well they hold.

Say Emily, say, but she could not.

The farmhand believed he was dead, but was not. Still breathing hard, he wondered why he had heard Emily call the dog.

# # #

On the roadside some skid marks, and a pile of glass that used to be a windshield. At every stop sign in a hilltown she leans over and half begs until she is happy. Tell me you love me.

This was different from the other fluids that made her — mottled underwear, noses treading on shirt cuffs; what dabbed her clothes with indelible stains.

Where blood was found unexpectedly was an augury. Nothing like what came from untied shoelaces or a cracked lip. This was the hayloft when the bottom wrung seemed unreachable, and corners propelled themselves beyond dimensions she had known.

Emily wanted her mother, but could not say.

That night, taking the silences into her hands and bringing them back to her chest, she quietly slipped into bed with Margaret. She did what her mother said to do when hurt, One, Two, Three, and swear, but do it quietly so God doesn’t hear you.

Lies live with true or false depending on how well they’re told.

# # #

Hannah thinks Herb only half-listens. Anything you can call lazy to their face and get away with it only half-listens.

The farmhand pulled up the floor and sectioned the parents with an ax, then Margaret. Emily was last. He stroked her hair where it was not matted. He watched her sleeping. This was just another kind of sleeping. These are bones to hold the earth in place.

The boards are put back in place.

Herb loves you more from your hand on his head. Every tree, what’s more, every leaf, every needle, every goddamn piece of trash holds. And love holds.

When light through the window woke him, the farmhand stood from the floor, left open the door to the house, and walked down the road. He looked until the horizon protruded on the edge of a cloud like an arm tattooed with light. The monstrous wealth of sky was purple, and pink, and blue, and the blue of his mother’s apron, and blue, the eye of a calf motionless in the far field after an ice storm — the vein that runs just below the surface — and blue.

Say the ground is woven with bits of root and bone. The ground is woven with the diaphanous swelling of where a birch once was. And loves.

# # #

You and you and you. There were birch trees here, and here, and here. Some branches are torn by a boy pulling.

Hannah sat on Emily’s bed and sang quietly. Not a lullaby. Later her husband asked what took so long. She had a nightmare.

A birch is felled once. And when you take the ax to a cornfield? The birch you’d swing through, but it is there, even after the ax, even after the hollering rot of a stump has been ripped up by chains.

And the stump? A quarter column from ruins? A seat for a table? Some sculpture for a patron?

Birch trees die as birch trees. Stumps as stumps.

People die in houses. They die in railroad yards, barrooms, in hospitals, at an intersection in their best pajamas, and in churches. They die and are never found. They die and are found only after a hotel guest starts to smell something foul.

The sheriff never found the farmhand from Douglas.

# # #

All that we know is not all that is laudable.

Make ugly things sound pretty and they will pass. The twilight hung in the lilac bushes.

The doctor told the sheriff he would not have found it if she wasn’t mutilated. The girl’s only a couple of weeks along.

Sometimes the heart beats wildly (and loves) for nothing, for nonsense. In the name of the Hank, the Herb, and the Holy Hannah.

The kingdom of Heaven resembles a cottonwood seed, is what her father told her. Emily pictured trees made of cotton.

Postal Services,"Please be aware that this story contains harsh language and mature subject matter dealing with suicide.

The sad part about the whole thing is that we used to make jokes about it. “Don’t go postal!” or “Mike’s goin’ postal!” It was funny. We all laughed. It seemed okay to do that, because it seemed like an okay place to work. I never thought I’d say that about a post office, but it really was. Really.

When I first started working there, the office didn’t seem claustrophobic or imprisoning. Enthusiastic determination fueled the office, and the veteran mail delivery drivers let it carry them as far as it could. Usually they didn’t need anything else, but there were some exceptions.

Francis came into the office every morning with a massive mug of coffee. That was his exception, really. He’d lumber over to our shared desk and comment on how early it was, or how little sleep he’d gotten. Either that, or he’d say something about how he’d be dead without coffee. He acted like he worshipped coffee, he really did.

This morning, though, right after he tramped in and conducted his morning routine, he dove right in to an intricate recollection of the previous day’s events. This happened — not often, but enough for us to coin a phrase for these occurrences:

“Had another ‘shoot the messenger’ yesterday. You won’t believe this.”

“Really? Tell me — ”

I didn’t need to ask him to tell me. He would have told me, even if I’d asked him to shut the hell up.

“Yesterday, I’m opening a mailbox, deliverin’ a bundle of letters. Some of ’em, probably bills n’ stuff. But anyways. This guy opens the door and starts yellin’ at me, wavin’ a package in his arms like it’s a fucking pitchfork.”

“A pitchfork? Really?”

“Yeah.” Francis took a swig of his massive coffee and continued, using a muffled voice for his impersonations: “Starts yellin’: You son-of-a-bitch, you delivered the wrong package, you son-of-a-bitch, what the hell? And I tell ‘im: I’m just the guy who brings it from one place to another. Don’t blame me. I just deliver to whereever the package says. It says 134 Hickory Lane, I deliver it to 134 Hickory Lane. It says 8623 Dashmore? I take it to 8623 Dashmore. Simple. Don’t shoot the messenger.”

“Don’t shoot the messenger.” I muttered, and looked back to the stack of papers in front of me. Francis took one more massive gulp from his coffee, and got back to work.

I felt like that was the beginning of the whole mess of things. The next day, the weather closed down on us and decided to make life hell for the next seven days. On top of that, Stinson gave us both a dozen extra streets. I tried to tell him that the extra streets were just going to slow us down and screw things up right before the holidays, but he wouldn’t have it. He’s one of those stick-in-the-mud tightasses — I wouldn’t be surprised to find out he’d tattooed the Post Office Creed on his wife’s neck. Stinson has the Creed on at least half a dozen plaques and signs in his office. Really, he does.

But I got used to that. I adapt quickly, I do. I found the most efficient way to take the route, and that day, I was actually ahead of schedule. Ready to finish twenty minutes early. I got a call from Stinson, telling me that he had two more loads of mail and deliveries for me to take out before I could wrap for the day. And that did it. It really did.

I drove home, got my Magnum out of my drawer, and drove to the Post Office. Suddenly, all those times Francis joked about “going postal” became extremely funny. I smiled when I walked inside, and realized how claustrophobically tomb-like our offices were.

Francis was already at our poor excuse for a shared desk. He looked up, bringing that massive mug of coffee to his lips for the last time. The steaming beverage ended up splashed all over the wall. I found Stinson, and shot him, too. His wife would become a grieving widow, but at least she would be left with that fucking Postal Creed, tattooed across her neckline.

I thought about what I might’ve told Francis if I’d had to explain it all. Maybe I’d just have told him it was a “shoot the messenger.” He probably would have just taken a massive gulp of his coffee and nodded.

I walked out of the post office. The police swarmed around me, yelling and screaming all kinds of ridiculous things. I turned the gun to my head, and pulled the trigger.

A SEA OF FACES,"In late 2010, two years after I’d uprooted my life and moved from suburban Indianapolis to Memphis, Tennessee, to live with and then marry the girl from that long-distance thing, I experienced a severe depressive breakdown. I couldn’t seem to accomplish anything, no matter how I tried. Up to that point, I had thrived on the energy that writing and music gave me, but I just couldn’t do it any more.

But — maybe by instinct, maybe by desperation — I kept taking selfies on my iPhone. Depression selfies definitely weren’t a thing then, but that seems to be what I was doing — documenting myself to remind myself that I was still there. One day, in late 2010, I stepped into the bathroom, looked in the mirror, decided I looked great, smiled as big as I could, and snapped a picture. The above was the result. I don’t know why I thought that was a smile, why I thought that a sweat-stained plain white tee was a great look, why I didn’t notice that my eyes were swollen from constant almost-crying, or that my eyes were almost completely vacant. Also my haircut was stupid, but my haircuts were always stupid until pretty recently. I do know why I thought I looked great, though: I wasn’t asleep or doubled over in the shower trying to convince myself to stop wanting to die. That ugly selfie was both a declaration of victory in that day’s battle and a rallying cry for the months to come. I could at least stand up. When my brain was screaming for me to kill myself, I could choose to do nothing.

I lost a job to that depression. My marriage spoiled into an abusive dynamic. (Which is a total chicken/egg discussion. I don’t remember which came first. I suspect depression did, largely because I was in such a vulnerable position for manipulation — I wanted to die every second I was awake; why would I not also believe that I was unloveable, unworthy of eating, deserving of being hit?)

New Year’s Eve, 2011, my wife insisted that she bring a friend over and didn’t allow me to invite anyone. It was the guy whose house she had been spending several nights a week at. By midnight, she had fallen asleep on his shoulder, after putting a pillow between us. I don’t know how I worked up the nerve to document that with a selfie:

On showing that picture to my therapist, he rightly insisted I move out. Which I did, but not until she told me to. About a week later.

It was weirdly magic. The difference happened almost immediately. This is from May 2012:

It wasn’t a sudden, complete change, but very rapidly (and really, I’ve only noticed while collecting these selfies), the light came back to my eyes, I re-learned how to smile (if only slightly).",https://medium.com/matter/a-sea-of-faces-f73db429921a,['Rachel Syme'],2015-11-19 19:28:32.099000+00:00,"['Big Stories Matter', 'Selfies', 'Social Media']"
What would a supermarket just for guys look like?,"We do most of our grocery shopping online, but this still applies. Why is the site showing me 10 different colors of soap? I buy the same one each time (don’t ask me what it’s called, it’s the one my wife puts on the list…).

The paradox of choice (watch the great TED talk below if you haven’t yet), states plainly that too much choice isn’t good for us, so why isn’t there a shopping establishment (off or online) that offers me only one choice?!

How many types of bread do I need to see before I pull a bun of the shelf? How many types of cereal do I need?

I want a shop that knows me and displays to me only the items I buy, don’t try to have me move to a different product, that’s a slippery slope, simply show me only the brand of coffee I drink, all the rest is noise!

No One’s Gonna Remember You,"Scooter Braun discovered Justin Bieber on YouTube. Now he also represents Ariana Grande, Psy, Carly Rae Jepsen, and several other pop culture phenomena.

I’d love to tell you that there are all these lessons and that a lot of my success was based on things that I learned and how I was able to move forward. But really it’s just being stupid enough to think you can do it.

I was too dumb to think about all the conservative reasons why me achieving the things I wanted to achieve were very close to impossible.

It started in first grade. I went to a party and the clown-magician guy was like, “What’s your name? Scott? Scooter!” and I was like, “Shut up, clown-magician guy, my name is Scott!” And my brother, Adam, saw this, and anything that pissed me off, he loved. I had very big lips growing up, so my brother started to call me Scooter Fish because he decided a scooter fish has big lips. So it was, “Scooter Fish this,” “Scooter Fish that.” And I’d chase him around the house and beat the shit out of him.

My dad was a refugee from Hungary, the child of Holocaust survivors, so it was always very important for him to give back. And my mom lost her father when she was eleven and grew up with very little. So there was always an extra bedroom with someone in it in our home.

One day my dad got a phone call from a buddy of his in Philadelphia, saying, “Two kids, good kids, they’re living in an abandoned tenement in Philadelphia, very bad situation, the guy who brought them over from Africa had the wrong intentions. Could you help them out and put them on your AAU basketball team, maybe find them a prep school?”

The kids were from Mozambique. Really good kids. After a week, one of them, Cornelio, in his broken English, said: “Can we stay?” And my dad said: “A couple more weeks until we figure this out? Yeah, sure.” Cornelio said: “No, forever.”

We had one family meeting, and they were adopted.

People hear this story about your family adopting kids and they think, “Oh my God, it’s so amazing for those kids!” But they don’t realize it was just as amazing for us.

I remember watching Cornelio come home from school for the first day. He was very upset because they kept giving him books in every classroom, putting them in his backpack, and sending him to the next room. He kept trying to communicate, but in Portuguese — his English wasn’t good enough, and he didn’t know how to ask what he wanted to ask. He was upset because where he comes from there aren’t enough books for all kids to take home. You have to keep the books at school. And he thought he was going to get in trouble for bringing the books home. When you hear a story like that, you start to realize how much you take for granted in your everyday life.

Every night before we went to sleep — every night — my dad would walk in the room, and he’d say, “Brauns are different. You’re special.” We’d say: “What does that mean, Dad?” And he’d say: “You’re not better than anybody, but you’re different, and you’re not going to be held to the normal standards that other kids are going to be held to, because if you want to be extraordinary, you’ve got to be held to extraordinary standards.” Every night. After a while, you start to believe that shit.

If you really love someone, you push them.

If it’s achievable, there’s no excuse why you shouldn’t be doing it.

If you’re not going to do it to the best of your ability, then don’t do it at all.

There’s been a lot of studies on children of the Holocaust, descendants of the Holocaust. They look at the world very differently. You grow up with these stories that my grandparents told me. As good as your life is today, you have to plan for the worst tomorrow, constantly. And you also have to try to achieve as much as you can because you don’t know if tomorrow is going to be there. Tomorrow is not promised.

To me, surprising my dad meant impressing him. Even in small ways. I’d get a fast break on the basketball court but pull up for a three-pointer. And you’d hear my dad, who was coaching, go: “SCOTT! NO, NO, NO!!!” And then when the ball went through the net, he’d be: “Okay!”

Ball is life, man. You never heard that?

You can’t have five point guards on the floor. You’ve got to have your roles, and you’re going to have to depend on each other, because no one can win on their own.

Braun playing basketball

What I really love about Phil Jackson is how he got guys like Michael Jordan to listen. This wasn’t the bull-in-the-china-shop approach that I’d known my entire life. He was able to get other great people to listen to him so he could shape them.

You have to speak to very talented and very opinionated people in a way that keeps them in a mindset where they’re not threatened and they’re willing to listen to you and trust you so you can grow with them.

I never had the privilege of being the big kid who walks in the park with the attitude that says: I’m going to pummel you guys. I was the tiny kid. In seventh grade, a girl called me a shrimp and I cried the entire night. What a bitch! But it gave me this sensitivity . . . you just don’t treat people poorly. Because I know what it’s like to be that person.

I was four eleven as a freshman. I grew twelve inches in high school — four inches every year. So at the start I was the short kid who was friends with all the girls but not big enough to date them, right? I had to be a very good listener. It was the only way they would talk to me. And it actually served me when I grew. I had heard them vent to me about all the guys who disrespected the girls and were rude. So I never became that dude.

When you’re that small, you find yourself observing a lot because you’re physically not able to compete. You have to use your mind in a different way.

Understand the little man and show respect. And understand that the little man today might not be the little man tomorrow.

Treat the janitor like the CEO.

I wanted my own story. I wanted not to be Ervin and Susan’s kid. Here I was hearing the story of my grandpa and the Holocaust and what he did to get our family out after the Hungarian Revolution . . . and then hearing about my father, you know, coming from Queens and getting us to Greenwich, Connecticut. I didn’t want to be that first kid to grow up with means. I wanted to do it on my own, the same way my father did it, the same way his father did it. So I wanted to go far away so I could make my own story.

In high school, people called me Scott. Scooter was a name only close, close friends called me. My buddy made me a bet that I couldn’t introduce myself to everyone at Emory as Scooter. Hundred bucks. Orientation starts and they say, “Scott Braun” and I say, “I’m sorry, but my name is Scooter.” When I threw the first party and put Scooter Braun on the flyer, that was it. I was in. I was Scooter to everyone who came, and it became this thing.

No one remembers Scott. But it’s really easy to remember Scooter.

Sometimes having your name shift allows you to feel like you’re getting to recreate your story.

I used to not listen.

I was the kid who always said, “I’m going to do this!” and then six months later, even though I gave it the best effort, it didn’t work out. And someone would say, “Hey, what happened with that?” and I’d be like, “Well it didn’t work out” and they’d be like, “You’re full of shit. You talk so much bullshit, you say you’re going to do this, you say you’re going to do that. . . .” Scott did that. Scooter didn’t talk. Scooter would tell you, “I just did this. It’s over, it’s done.” He learned that lesson. He got to start over.

Sometimes the smartest person for the job is the wrong person for the job because they’re just negative. When you have negative people around you, doesn’t matter how capable or intelligent they are, they will hurt the culture of what you’re doing. What they do is they project their negativity onto you. And you start to look in the mirror and say: Do I even like myself? And you realize it isn’t even you. It’s them. They’re putting that shit on you.

Happiness is understanding it’s about the journey.

Risk is being stupid enough to walk around a corner where you don’t know what’s there.

Courage is doing what’s right in every single moment no matter what it means to you.

Sometimes situations change, and it’s not the right deal for you. But it’s important if you gave someone your word, you stick to your word. Even if it’s not the best deal. Even if you know you would have negotiated it differently because circumstances have changed. Unless the other side is doing something malicious or spiteful, when you give somebody your word, stick to it. That’s real courage.

I don’t look at money as success. I look at it as an avenue to freedom.

When I was about ten years old, a Greenpeace worker knocked on the door to our house in Connecticut. It’s a defining moment of my life. I run over, open the door, and he starts telling me the whole Greenpeace thing. Good salesman. I’m pumped. Let’s save the ocean. Let’s save the whales. Mom! Come here. Greenpeace guy! You’re always saying give back. We should do this. “Scott,” she says, “we give to a lot of charities. We can’t just give money to everyone who shows up at the door.” Mom . . . I begged her, and I think she wrote a seventy-five-dollar check. He was super grateful, and he left. I watch him walk out of our driveway and I’m thinking: Where’s his car? And my mom says he doesn’t have a car. That he’s walking from house to house as part of his mission to show people he supports the environment. It’s part of him showing his devotion and his dedication to the cause. And I thought: Okay, cool, but there’s no train station close to here. There’s no cabs. That’s a long walk. And in that moment he was like a hero. To be that dedicated and that passionate to his cause. In that exact same moment, I realized without my mom writing him that check, he was just a guy walking door to door. That’s when I decided I would never, ever have to rely on a little kid begging his mom to give me a check to make a difference in the world. So I ran for class president. And I wanted to be successful. So when my brother says, Hey, I want to do this charity to build schools for children, I can write him a check. I wanted to be in a place of influence because I never wanted to rely on anybody. The lesson I learned was to skip a step.

My first memory is of my Uncle Will coming to visit me when I was born. Everyone thinks I’m crazy. They say: “That’s impossible. Babies can’t see distance when they’re born.” But I remember my Uncle Will wearing suspenders and I was completely fascinated with those things he was wearing. No one believes me. But Uncle Will says he was wearing suspenders. That’s my story, and I’m sticking with it.

It’s this weird thing that happens. I get a gut check in this way I can’t explain. It kinda feels like, Oh, I know what this is. It’s like something else is telling me.

I saw the video of Justin. It had sixty thousand views. My gut went: That’s the kid you’re looking for. And I knew, as I watched those videos, what to do. I had the whole plan in my head. I knew the next four years. Done.

I compare it to falling in love. I told my wife on the first date I was gonna marry her.

She freaked out. Completely freaked out.

But at the same time, she was freaked out that she wasn’t more freaked out.

Just because you know doesn’t mean they know.

Same thing with Justin and his mother. Found him, give them this idea, sounds crazy, but something in their gut is saying this guy is telling the truth. Then I have to show them it’s real.

At some point you gotta believe in a higher power and some mysterious plan that we don’t understand, that we can’t even fathom, because we’re just too small to fathom. Certain things happen and you just get gut feelings and intuition that simply doesn’t make sense. And you go against every logical thought in your head and it works out because something inside you tells you to do it.",https://medium.com/what-ive-learned/no-one-s-gonna-remember-you-62f49e21e54b,['Esquire Classics'],2015-05-08 13:31:20.058000+00:00,"['Justin Bieber', 'Esquire', 'What Ive Learned']"

Carroll Gardens and Dry Erase Wires,"May 23rd, 2014

A Story Each Day

I unlocked my bike from the handrail and precariously carried it down the tight stairwell, down the five flights of stairs and out onto fourth avenue. I looked down toward 22nd street. The sky churned and taunted me, threatening to grow dark, but this was my chance — I wouldn’t have another free day to bike the across the bridge into Manhattan, and so whether it rained or not, this was it. I stepped onto my bike, and was off.

22nd street, 21st street, 20th street — all the way down to 9th street, past the Brooklyn Hot Dog shop that I’d have visited if I had less respect for calories. I biked past all of the roaring dusty construction near Smith Street, and north, through the tree shrouded streets of Carroll Gardens.

Someday.

I thought. Someday, I’ll live here, in a nice, clean brownstone with trees on my street, two blocks from a fancy restaurant, and a block from a bookstore, with a nice wife and two kids.

I biked past Mercury Coffee, and that chocolate shop that I’d have visited if I had less respect for my bank account. The rich aroma wafted through the streets and made me wish that I was inside, slowly easing my afternoon away, instead of racing like mad toward the Brooklyn Bridge.

The serenity of Carroll Gardens slowly gave way to the densely packed streets of downtown Brooklyn, and I snaked my way through the traffic, leaving my desire for a clean, calm, and rich-smelling brownstone far behind.

I raced onto the bike path in between the two lanes and saw the bridge ahead of me — massive, strong, ancient and durable in the billowing clouds, not like the last bridge crossed.

The last bridge that I crossed: I’m still not sure if I want to tell you where it was, or even if I could. It was fragile, and rickety, even though I’m sure that it wasn’t always like that. I used to cross that bridge every single day, until it slowly wore out.

My mind snapped back to the Brooklyn Bridge as I jerked out of the way to avoid a tourist. I stole a glance over my shoulder and heard a British tourist apologizing for trying to snap a picture while standing in the bike lane.

The last bridge I crossed was never as busy as the Brooklyn Bridge — if it was, it would’ve broken down much sooner.

I paused underneath the first tower to look up at the expanse of wires, netting the bridge together like dry erase marker on a whiteboard sky. I thought about snapping a picture to remember, but I have no trouble remembering bridges that I’ve crossed. I reached the second tower quickly, and passed squad upon squad of tourists who stopped to buy candy at the end of the bridge. I let my bike glide down the ramp and onto the busy streets of Manhattan.

The last bridge I crossed didn’t take me to a frenetic city, brimming to the edge with a corrupt density of people. The last bridge I crossed took me to her, and the last time I crossed it, I had already let it grow old and decay and sag. The Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge have the city of New York to repair them and watch out for them, replace the broken boards and fill in the cracking asphalt. But our bridge only had us. We had built it ourselves; starting from the moment we saw each other. And with the first words we said to each other, we started to lay the foundation. Our eyes built the bridge that our hearts slowly crossed, and we found ourselves standing above open water, looking down at the crashing waves.

But then, one day, we stopped crossing it. We found other ways to get to where we wanted to go. The asphalt cracked, and the wooden boards on the pedestrian path started to rot. The bridge started to sag and the waves below us started to eat away at the foundation.

The last time she crossed it, she’d visited me, in Brooklyn — Or at least, I thought she did. She was there in person, with her smooth humble smile and her rich quiet laughter — but her mind was somewhere else.

We talked for six hours. Riding the subway through Manhattan like it was an attraction at Disney, and we were nine-year-old gluttons for entertainment with an all-day pass to the amusement park.

Something finally came into focus, like I’d been using a cheap lens set on auto focus, when I should’ve just been adjusting the focus manually all along. I’m not sure if it was my god, or her skepticism, or if it was her family, or my loneliness. Or my desire to settle down in a calm, clean brownstone in a neighborhood like Carroll Gardens, when all she wanted was anything but that. Someday, I told her, but she didn’t want to hear any of that. And no matter how many more times I wanted to cross the bridge that we had built, it had already been crumbling beneath my feet, and I was hanging onto the dry erase wires with both hands.

I said goodbye to her at the airport. She turned, and left, and that was the last chance I had to cross that bridge before it finally crumbled to pieces and fell into the waves below it.

And so I paused, caught my breath, and turned my bike around, back across the Brooklyn Bridge, for the very last time.",https://medium.com/a-story-each-day/carroll-gardens-and-dry-erase-wires-5e31bc997dcd,['A Story Each Day'],2015-05-24 03:03:54.419000+00:00,"['Short Story', 'Fiction', 'A Story Each Day']"
Bitter fruits of a split in Islam,"At the center of the split is a question of religious authority and political legitimacy. Islam embraces a worldview that makes no formal distinction between politics and faith, and Muhammad exercised power over both spheres.

But the Prophet named no clear successor, leaving the community to grapple with two central questions still facing believers: Who is a good Muslim? And who gets to say?

Differing answers provided the framework for the development of the Sunni and the Shia. The same questions have attracted countless pretenders, would-be prophets and revolutionaries, including such disparate figures as Ayatollah Khomeini and Osama bin Laden.

Little is known in any historical sense of Islam’s early years. But both Sunni and Shia have developed powerful traditions to explain their respective pasts, justify the present and express future hopes.

The same traditions have given birth to distinct cultural and ritual differences, although the central tenets of Islam are common to both communities.

“Rejecters” and “Usurpers”

To the Sunni, it is accepted that the first Caliphs (from khalifa, or successor) were chosen from among Muhammad’s companions, those who followed his example.

These figures testified to the Prophet’s deeds and sayings, which form the basis of much of Islamic law and practice. Refusal to recognize these leaders lies behind the Sunni charge, popular among today’s Salafis, that the Shia are “rejecters,” or heretics.

For the Shia, the acceptable succession follows the Prophet’s bloodline, from his cousin and son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib and through the male descendants, considered defenders of truth and justice. For the Shia, the Sunni are “usurpers” who stole the Prophet’s mantle from its rightful heirs.

The most prominent Shia grouping today, the Twelver Shia concentrated in Iran, Iraq and parts of Lebanon and the Gulf, recognize the authority of Ali and his 11 descendants.

They believe Twelfth Imam went into hiding in 874 to escape the Sunni assassins who killed his predecessors, and his eventual return at an indeterminate future date — eagerly awaited by Shia everywhere — will bring in an age of peace and justice.

Other Shia groups, most prominently the Islamailis and the Zaydis, follow different lines of succession.

In all, there are around 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide, with the Shia representing around 12 percent of that figure. As many as 80 percent of them are concentrated in just four countries: Iran, Pakistan, India and Iraq.",https://medium.com/news-decoder/bitter-fruits-of-a-split-in-islam-c93707d4d839,[],2015-06-15 19:24:45.667000+00:00,"['Saudi Arabia', 'Islam', 'Iran']"
Data are Beautiful,"A datum is a single piece of information. There are two plural forms for datum. The lesser known form, datums, is used exclusively in surveying and geodesy. The other plural form surrounds us both physically and figuratively. It can be big or small, right or wrong, new or old, dull or interesting. In the end it’s just a long line of 1s and 0s, stored right here or way over there. I’m talking about data.

There are even multiple ways to pronounce it.

Because data is a plural noun, it's technically more correct in English to say “data are”. But in the real-world, using “data is” is fine, especially because it’s considered to be a mass noun. Outside of the real world, there is some debate between “data is” and “data are” (here, here or here, for example). But languages evolve — I’m cool with that. I don’t even care if you say datas, as long as those datas are good.

It turns out that ""data is"" and ""data are"" occur about equally, after the strong decline of ""data are"" in the 80s and 90s. And this data ain't for chatspeak, it's text that was published and hopefully edited, according to Google's N-gram viewer.

Who is more likely to still use the proper phrasing? It's those pesky British English speakers and writers in red that are holding on. (As compared to American English, in blue.)

In all forms of English, an interesting observation stands out: When starting a sentence, the trend reverses. ""The data are"" and ""Data are"" are approximately twice as common as ""The data is"" and ""Data is"".

I have no idea why, but I'll list any good guess here:

Idea 1. People tend to be more careful with their words at the beginning of a statement...

Idea 2. ________________________

Whatever you prefer, we can agree that Data was, were, is, are, and will be Beautiful. (And sometimes ugly.)

Data - it’s still more popular than sex, drugs, and rock & roll.

But only in books.

Across the entire internet,

sex still wins.

How to Take the Subway,"You can tell a lot about a city by its public transit system. Switzerland’s metros are clean and orderly, and their stations have vending machines with Diet Coke, condoms, smiley face cookies and “Maybe Baby” brand pregnancy tests.

Santa Monica’s buses are clean, with easy-to-understand routes that nearly always get you where you need to go, albeit 15–20 minutes late.

Rome’s lightrail features broken pay stations as well as German tourists incredibly frustrated at their seemingly free ride.

I’m not entirely convinced that every train in Scotland isn’t the Hogwarts Express.

But there is no transit system I know better than the LA Metro.

The first time I rode the subway was with my boyfriend. The second time was also with my boyfriend and also his roommate. The third time I went by myself.

“Wait, you’re not going with me?”

“No babe, I have some work to do. You’ll be fine.”

“Promise?”

“Yeah, I take it all the time. You’ll be safe.”

Cut to: A 5'4"" man in a cowboy hat named Roberto trying to lick my hand.

I had forgotten that the testament to the Metro’s safety came from someone who has never traveled with lady parts and therefore wouldn’t know the kind of perils that await us. Neither my boyfriend nor his similarly male-bodied roommate had been made privvy to the ever-present risk of assault or our apparent responsibility to deter it. At worst they’d been told to buy those tacky wallet-on-chain deals your older brother wore in 1998 during his ska punk phase to deter muggers.

I yanked my hand away in shock. “Tienes un novio?” he asked, as if the presence of another man in my life would be the only reason I wouldn’t let a stranger lick my extremities. I responded in the affirmative and he shrugged, sitting in silence next to me for the rest of the trip.

It’s tough being a lady alone in the city, but that first solo ride on the LA Metro taught me a few important lessons.

Lesson 1: Don’t make eye contact.

Many people see eye contact as a invitation to talk to you about their stint as a failed actor or try to sell you $7 chocolate. Some people will still try to do this even if you don’t make eye contact. But, just to be safe, stare at the ground. Just keep staring. Even if you end up missing your stop because you can’t look up. Just. Keep. Staring.

Lesson 2: De-emphasize your figure.

If you are a lady and have a vaguely lady-ish body, people will try to touch or talk to it while you are just trying to wait for the Red Line. Try to draw as little attention to your figure as possible. Might I suggest a Hazmat suit or a garbage bag? Black Hefty of course, you can’t run around in a white Glad Forceflex like some subway tart.",https://medium.com/endless/ah-public-transit-2fd0c84abdf9,['Devon Henry'],2015-08-14 18:55:10.407000+00:00,"['Women', 'Comedy', 'Humor']"
The Queer Case of Luke O’Donovan,"I found Luke’s decision to plead guilty more believable when I saw Judge Markle’s bias. I could see the judge trying to exclude relevant evidence, and manipulating the trial so that Luke would have the greatest chance of being convicted.

Still, something nagged at me about Luke’s decision to accept the plea, something about the charming poise he exuded throughout the proceedings. His support website posted a video of him inviting supporters to come to the court house for his hearing. He winks at the camera at the end, and one of his friends asked me later, “Don’t you think that’s the cutest thing?” Yes, yes it was, and that disturbed me. I didn’t want to feel like Luke was flirting with his supporters, with me, while I was trying to figure out the truth.

After the trial, I called Cheryl Mainor’s office but they said she was still in Atlanta. So I sent her a Facebook message asking if I could interview her.

She wrote a vehement reply, questioning why I would be writing about the case and repeating her belief that media coverage injures the men and their families. She ended her message with: “It is my opinion that Mr. O’Donovan is a sociopath, and dangerous, as he has already issued a statement of his innocence, after pleading guilty, making a mockery of the justice system, and further hurting those he wounded.”

I wondered whether someone who expresses herself with this much self-assurance could be fundamentally mistaken, and my interactions with Luke were already raising red flags in my head about the degree to which he was culpable. My conversation with Cheryl left me with further doubts about Luke’s version of the story.

Luke’s mugshot

Cheryl’s major contention was that Luke’s friends, led by Erin Connolly, made up the self-defense story after the fact. That was the reason, she said, why stories in the local news that claimed Luke had been attacked only surfaced two days after the incident. The injuries to her son and the others were extensive, while Luke’s didn’t even need to be treated at the hospital. And according to Cheryl, his mugshot doesn’t even look like someone who’s been through a beating like he claims.

I had seen the picture Cheryl was referring to, but I didn’t make the connection until then that because this was Luke’s mugshot, it was the one piece of photographic evidence about his physical state that night. And it was true that while the other men had to be extensively treated, Luke seemed fine and didn’t show obvious signs of a savage beating.

When I asked Cheryl how she would account for the great numbers of Luke’s supporters, she said, “Those people weren’t even at the party. My son and his friends were there. They were the ones who got stabbed. You know how one person convinces another and then another and then another, and pretty soon they’re all convinced even if it’s not actually true? I think that’s what’s happening. I think Luke is fooling everyone.”

Cheryl also told me she would put me in touch with people who could confirm her claims, including the men themselves, but she never did. My efforts to contact the Atlanta police and the attorney general’s office also went unanswered, and I didn’t have time to knock on people’s doors before I left town.

But this conversation with Cheryl left me feeling like I might be among the ones that Luke and his friends could be duping. I was aware, the whole time I was looking at the case, that Luke’s supporters were meeting together at an undisclosed location I wasn’t invited to. And my major sources for the story were people that Jerry had put me in touch with, the same people that both Cheryl and Judge Markle deemed unreliable. I had to take a good look at myself and ask whether my own bias was clouding my judgment.

I had already made significant sacrifices to stay for Luke’s trial. I had no steady job for the summer and barely any cash, so renting a room for two extra days in Atlanta threatened my ability to get back home. I also delayed my departure by two days, compromising the stories I was supposed to be working on in New Orleans and Dallas. And I was suddenly faced with the possibility that these sacrifices were for the sake of a bunch of queer anarchists who were fooling me into writing a story supporting Luke, a story that serves their purposes but may not be the truth.

After this conversation, I called one of my contacts from Luke’s support team to let them know I was investigating some of Cheryl’s claims, and that I should probably be less in touch so that I can maintain a modicum of journalistic objectivity.

“That worries me,” my contact said. “It doesn’t sound like you’re on our side.”

This reply didn’t make me feel better about the possiblity that Luke’s supporters were conspiring to put out false information about the case. I was starting to feel stupid for getting involved. I called my own partner Josh to let off steam. Like Luke and Erin, Josh and I seemed straight but were both queer. Like them, we get involved with other people.

Josh comforted me the way partners do, telling me it was fine and that whatever happens, we would figure things out, and that I won’t regret working on the story. Josh is one of those people who doesn’t process information the way most people do. Rather than looking at all the dimensions, he tends to focus on a key part and distill what to him seems vital. And this time, he said something that made me think about the case in a way I hadn’t before:

“Does it really matter if he’s innocent?”

The one source I didn’t get directly from Jerry was Madison Hall. We had trouble meeting in person because she lived an hour away from Atlanta, so we spoke on the phone several times. She describes herself as an acquaintance of Luke’s who happened to be leaving the party when he pleaded with her to stop her car and help him get away from the men who were chasing him.

From the start, Madison was incensed at the media’s portrayal of the case, especially because she also knew Andrew Mainor and was aware of the group’s homophobia. She told me she wasn’t surprised when the men ended up attacking Luke.

An Instagram photo Madison Hall sent me of the interior of her car following the incident. The bloody handprints on the bottom right were of Luke when he came into the car and sat on the passenger’s lap, before getting into the back seat.

Contrary to Cheryl’s claim that the self-defense story did not appear until at least two days after the party, Madison told me she filed a police report that same afternoon, which I was later able to obtain. In it, she wrote that Luke’s first words when she got into her car while being chased by a gang of men were “Please don’t stop please. Keep going. They’re trying to kill me!”

Madison told me that the officer who took her statement kept interrogating her about her sexual orientation. And even though the police claim to have investigated both sides of the story, no one followed up with her about her report.

It took us some time, but Madison also helped me track down Toby Weston, a friend’s date who ended up riding with her in the back seat of her car that night. Toby did not know either Madison or Luke prior to the incident, and had not interacted with anyone associated with the case until I talked to him.

Toby corroborated Madison’s version of events. He said that Luke was really shaken when he got to the back seat. “I just told him to hang in there,” Toby said. “I covered the stab wounds on his back with my hand so he wouldn’t bleed.”

He also said that as he and Madison were waiting in the hospital, a friend of the men who might have suspected them of being Luke’s friends, came up to Toby and yelled, “What are you looking at, faggot?” To avoid a confrontation, Toby and Madison left the hospital prior to Luke being released. It was only later they found out that he had been arrested.

When I asked Toby why he didn’t file a police report, he said that he called the police two days after the incident, told his story, and asked if they wanted him to come in. The police said someone was going to get back to him, but they never did.",https://medium.com/the-archipelago/the-queer-case-of-luke-odonovan-4be5bbcbb198,['Meredith Talusan'],2015-03-01 01:49:39.613000+00:00,"['Crime', 'Long Reads', 'LGBT']"
An Interview with Abdal Hakim Murad,"How are you?

Thanks to Allah, my health is excellent! And it’s a joy to be talking to you and contributing in a small way to the great work you do.

Congratulations on entering your fifth year at the Cambridge Muslim College, what was your vision for the college and has this been fulfilled?

Our sense when we founded the college was that the first significant generation of British Muslims had the honour of building the mosques and now the time has come to work on the message being given in the mosques. Often listeners complain that our imams are not dealing with the real issues of modern British Muslim men and women, and especially the youth. Their culture is too different. So the College was created to produce a new generation of relevant Muslim leaders who really understand modernity, British culture, and the issues of the youth.

Studying eighteen modules over one year sounds very intensive. What does being a student at Cambridge Muslim College entail?

It’s a steep learning curve, but al-hamdu li’Llah our students are very dedicated. They don’t mind the hard work, learning how to deal with modern science, modern philosophy, other religions, social problems, and so on, because they are motivated to learn, and see why our programme is important. And the students get to go on many trips outside Cambridge. There is a yearly visit to Rome, for instance, which is a chance to relax as well as to learn.

Do you have any further plans for the college?

The future is in Allah’s hands, but we are raising funds for a building to be constructed behind our main building in Cambridge, which will include more lecture facilities, rooms for scholars, and a larger prayer room, and also a central research library for British Muslims to come and use. That will enable us to realize our dream of launching a complete accredited BA degree programme in Islamic Studies, with up to eighty students studying on the site.

From your experience, what are the challenges young British Muslims face today?

They need to learn, so they can sort out in their minds the various challenges that the mass media and the surrounding culture throw at them. They need to have these challenges clearly explained, by people who have a culture that is authentically Islamic and rooted in a real knowledge of the country and its strengths and weaknesses. And they need to have trust in Allah, and not panic or become downcast by current events. The ummah has been through tough times before, but the principle of Tawhid is the strongest idea in history, and Islam always emerges strengthened whenever there is a test.

What steps do you feel need to be considered by masjids and mainstream Muslim organisations to address the needs of the Muslim and wider community?

Imams have to know English, and have to understand the culture of the new generation. They have to promote unity between different Muslim groups, it is damaging that our mosques are so ethnically segregated. They should promote intermarriage between different racial groups, and be friendly and helpful to converts. They should smile and remember that Islam is about the joyful celebration of Divine gifts, not the angry blaming of people who fall short of the ideal.

For a young person who would like to study the classical Islamic Sciences, what would be your advice? Are there any countries or organisations that you would recommend?

The Arab world is on fire at the moment, and it’s hard to give any advice, since the situation is changing so fast. The best students, in my experience, are studying in Turkey, and are not frightened to learn Turkish in order to achieve that. Looking at the map of the Muslim world, it seems that Indonesia and Turkey are set to become the leaders of the Ummah over the next few years, while the Arab world will lag further behind. The Turkish Islamic colleges are very selective, but are very good, especially in theology and Sharia.

You travel extensively in your work, where is the best place that your work has taken you?

Perhaps my favourite country is Brunei: a model of an Islamic country where ecological values are doing much to conserve the natural environment. But I also appreciate China, which has perhaps the most beautiful Sharia-compliant music I have ever heard.

What achievements are you most proud of?

That’s not an Islamic way of putting it! Everything is Allah’s gift, and is by His permission.

If you were granted one wish, what would it be?

My prayer is for Muslims to have more compassion and wisdom in dealing with each other.

Masha’Allah you are a great role model to our readers, but who was your role-model when you were growing up?

When I was young role models were less important. I suppose John Betjeman inspired many in the 1970s, to take tradition seriously, and to have a healthy skepticism about the ability of science and technology to make us happier and better people.

Any advice for the youth?

If you are studying, especially religious subjects, you should read Imam al-Ghazali’s little book ‘O Youth’ (Ayyuha’l-Walad), in the excellent translation by the British Muslim scholar Tobias Mayer. He shows in very simple language how to study in a way that yields light, sincerity and blessing. My recent book Commentary on the Eleventh Contentions also tries to be uplifting for young people, dealing with modern political and intellectual questions in a hundred short sound bites. Other advice: don’t forget anything you have memorized of the Holy Qur’an, because that is to lose light after gaining it, and the presence of the Book of Allah in your heart will influence and strengthen everything you do, if you have a good intention. Try to empathise with others, and see their situation from their point of view, whether they are Muslims or non-Muslims. Treat everyone with the respect due to all descendents of our first father Adam (AS). Do not hate unbelievers, feel sorry for them, because in most cases their unbelief is the result of an ignorance which may be our fault as much as theirs. Know that the world is Allah’s gift, and that He needs nothing in return, and that your worship and gratitude are part of His gift to you. And if you realize how much He gives, and how little you deserve or do, you will never stop praising Him. He is the infinitely lovable, the overlooker of faults; the Gifter of all beauty, so we are surrounded by a banquet! The only rule is: have good table manners, and do not spoil your enjoyment by overindulgence! Muslims are here to party, giving hamd and shukr, and we remember that the Sahaba had the most beautiful smiles.

Knowing when to nudge: Utilizing behavioral economics in education,"Behavioral economics, in the form of nudges to help students and families make more active and informed decisions, has entered the mainstream of American education, guiding practice and policy from when children are barely old enough to toddle all the way through college and beyond. As a result of nudge work over the last decade, school choice information is simpler and more visually digestible; the architecture of school cafeterias subtly encourages children to select healthier eating options; text messages flow in the hundreds of thousands if not millions, prompting parents to sing the ABCs with their children, high school graduates to finalize their financial aid, and college students to meet with their academic advisor.

The infusion of behavioral insights into education holds considerable potential for leveling the decision-making playing field for economically-disadvantaged students and their families throughout all stages of schooling. Targeted implementation of behavioral solutions can help compensate for low-income families’ lack of access to quality information or advising about their educational options. Well-designed nudges can help students and families make active and informed decisions about the educational pathways they pursue.

A cautionary note about nudges

Like any innovation in education, however, behavioral nudges do not offer a panacea. One question we have to wrestle with is: When should the nudging stop? Much of my research focuses on using text messaging to provide students with simplified information and access to assistance with college and financial aid decisions. When I present about this work, I often hear concerns that we are creating dependencies among the students we’re serving. “You’re texting them reminders about renewing their financial aid,” someone will say. “Are you going to nudge them to hand in their homework in college? To wake up in the morning? Where do you draw the line?” The flip side of this question is whether students will quickly learn to tune out educational nudges. Maybe putting fruit in front of the cafeteria register instead of candy leads kids to make healthier choices the first few times, but after a while do they just start seeking out the candy? And to paraphrase Richard Thaler, one of the pioneers of behavioral economics, how do we ensure educators nudge for good, using behavioral strategies to help students and families make active and informed decisions about what’s best for their personal circumstances, rather than use nudges to tell students what’s best for them?

Guiding principles for applying behavioral insights in education

Applied behavioral research in education is nascent enough that we lack empirical evidence to answer many of these questions. What we can rely on in the interim is a series of guiding principles that I believe should steer nudge work in education:

Start with critical junctures: From preschool through college, students and families face a series of transitional decisions that are often complex and hard to navigate, but which can have long-lasting ramifications for how they do in school and whether they pursue additional education. These junctures often occur over a short time frame — a window of only a few months in which students can actively choose which elementary school to attend, which high school courses to take, or whether to apply for financial aid for college. Families that stick with the default school or course assignment, or who fail to apply for financial aid by priority deadlines, may miss out on the chance to attend high-quality schools, take college-preparatory coursework, or receive thousands of dollars in additional grant aid. I am strongly in favor of well-designed nudges that encourage students and families to make active and informed decisions during these critical junctures. Prompt active engagement rather than give directions: Nudges that are overly directive run the risk of distorting the choices students and families make, leading them to make choices that don’t align with their goals or interests. An example would be to send students nudges encouraging them to limit how much they borrow for college. On the surface this seems advisable, but what about the student for whom additional loans would allow her to take more costly STEM courses and pursue an engineering degree? Similarly, declarative nudges (e.g. “Make sure you sign up for an after school enrichment program!”) can confuse and worry families who thought they had already completed an important task. Nudges should encourage active thinking and decision making, not tell people what to do. Well-framed and timed questions can also prompt students to reach out for professional guidance when they are struggling with a complicated decision. View nudges as supplements to, not substitutes for, existing educational investments: Behavioral interventions often have a creative appeal, and their low cost is alluring to educational leaders and policy makers who often are grappling with tight budgets. But the apparent “bang for the buck” of behavioral interventions should not be used as justification for scaling back spending on other important areas in education. After all, interventions to promote more active and informed decision-making only can be successful if there are quality educational opportunities available to students.

With these nudge principles in mind, we have a tremendous opportunity in the coming years to help students and families make more informed decisions and to pursue educational opportunities that allow them to realize their full potential. Over the long term, we should continue to invest in the systemic changes necessary to ensure that every student in America has a high quality education. But for the students who need our help today, behavioral nudges offer a powerful strategy for creating lasting educational improvement among disadvantaged populations.",https://medium.com/the-habit/knowing-when-to-nudge-utilizing-behavioral-economics-in-education-b9b00466468a,['The Brookings Institution'],2015-08-20 21:14:49.258000+00:00,"['Education', 'Education Reform']"
Grief and the Real Girl,"We know that experiencing the death of a loved one is supposed to be hard. When considering the hypothetical death of a hypothetical person, we know that we will be sad. We expect sleep to elude us, to cry a lot, to neglect to eat or get out of bed. Until it actually happens, that is. Then we find out it is all of these things and much more.

When my father died, grief revealed itself to be an entirely shattering experience. It unmoors your life, setting you violently adrift.

Nobody ever explains to you what it feels like to be in shock, real shock. You cannot comprehend how you could wake up so happily one Sunday morning, not for a moment anticipating the horror of the day ahead. You wouldn't believe it had happened at all if it weren't for the fact you are in the office at 5am, manically arranging a handover and somehow wearing the wedding band that was on his finger for 27 years.

You’re not warned about what responses to expect from other people when you tell them what has happened. Some are wonderful, sincere and do brilliant, thoughtful things like bring you food or groceries. Others are well-meaning but have nothing to say that isn’t cliché. You have to bite your tongue when they wheel out the phrase ‘your father in a better place’ or talk about how good it is that he isn’t suffering anymore. There is no silver lining here.

You have a vague idea of the paperwork that comes after a death, but you don’t expect it to be this insurmountable or maddening. When the girl in the Coroner’s Office nervously tells you that oh gosh, she can’t seem to find any paperwork about your father, you lay into her viciously, relentlessly and with little regret. You accompany your mother to the bank, you write to your sister’s school, you visit the funeral director and make choices you didn’t think you’d have to at 22.

You’re never cautioned against visiting your father for the last time. Naively, you think that seeing him in a coffin can’t possibly be worse than watching him die, but you quickly realise that actually, it is. It gives you the first nightmare you've had in years.

Nobody warns you how breathtakingly terrifying it is to think that someone will only exist in photographs and memories now. You desperately seek signs of life. You read through your emails and texts voraciously, trying to commit the way he talked to memory. You pore over his beloved iTunes and look for meaning in his most played songs. You shamefully hack into his iCloud, trying to find out if he managed to do the last thing on the to-do list hidden in his wallet: ‘Write letter to the girls’. He didn't and you struggle to find peace with that.",https://medium.com/bereavement-and-mourning/grief-and-the-real-girl-68847c683f38,['Leia Clancy'],2015-04-20 12:17:59.111000+00:00,"['Childhood', 'This Happened To Me', 'Death']"
A Brief History of the Syrian Conflict,"The story begins in March 2011 with pro-democracy demonstrations in the country. After police fired upon demonstrators the numbers grew to hundreds of thousands by that summer. Soon afterwards, the demonstrators began to take up arms against the government and the country descended into civil war. Adding to the chaos was the rise of the Islamic State, or ISIS, in the region that also began fighting.

The conflict truly hit the world stage when the use of chemical weapons was reported in August 2013. President Obama had before ‘drawn the line’ on the use of such weapons, implying that it would evoke outside military intervention. After this occurred, however, no such intervention took place and the UN and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons led the dismantling of the Syrian Government’s chemical weapons supply.

By September 2014, the ISIS threat had become a world news topic as they began to cause more trouble than the Syrian Rebels. The United States military began airstrikes, that have continued since then, aimed at slowing the advance of the Islamic Radicals.

Throughout all of this as well is the almost independent Kurdish resistance against the Islamic State. Although the Kurds in the northern part of Syria are a part of Syria, the government has done little to protect the region comparatively. The Kurds have been fighting the IS with their own militias.",https://medium.com/data-visualizations/a-brief-history-of-the-syrian-conflict-8e4d441a66bc,['Matt Mulholland'],2015-03-18 23:59:40.737000+00:00,"['Syria', 'ISIS', 'Data Visualization']"
Is Pope Francis An Atheist and Ten Other Things I Learned From Him,"My grandparents were disgusted with me when my first, second, and third girlfriends were Catholics.

“What do they cook?” my grandmother asked.

Cooking being the great differentiator in religion. She even said, “Goulash?” Like it was a curse.

Many years later, after a lot of grief, I sat in St. Patrick’s in NYC, praying for money. “please God, make my life better by giving me money”.

It didn’t matter to me that it was a church. I was so scared I didn’t know what to do.

I would do anything, even pray to a god I didn’t believe in, in a house of worship that I didn’t feel welcome in, and asking for something that prayer was never intended for.

Someone asked me yesterday. “what do you feel strongly about?”

I said, “nothing”.

He said “that’s a strong response. Don’t you worry about death?”

I said, “Why waste any part of today worrying about something that will happen later?”

Today Pope Francis arrives at St. Patrick’s in NYC. My guess is his motives will be loftier than mine. But I don’t know. Maybe he wants money also.

So I did some research. God or not, religion or not, Catholic or not, I try to learn from everyone.

Here’s what I love about Pope Francis on this holiest of Jewish holidays, Yom Kippur. And I don’t “believe” in the sanctity of either.

A) HE LIVES IN A STUDIO

When Pope Francis traveled to the Vatican for his inauguration he stayed in a hotel that he paid for himself.

And rather than move into the lavish 12-bedroom residence all prior popes live in, he chose a small studio with no staff.

Rather than mimic him, it’s interesting to just ask “why?” and think about it.

What is the example he wants to live by?

B) CUBA

Pope Francis wrote letters to Barack Obama and Raul Castro, encouraging them to get together.

That’s why we now have relations one again with Cuba, after 50 years.

Biologically we’re one species. But politically, for thousands of years we’ve divided up by false and artificial borders.

Imagine a world with no borders. Where trade and innovation flourishes. Where friendship and kindness can transcend ethnic and religious differences.

A world with no more arguing on daytime talk shows.

C) HE TOOK A SELFIE

See the photo. A bunch of teenagers approached him. Asked him for a photo. And they took a selfie.

He doesn’t put himself on a pedestal (he drives a Kia instead of the previous “popemobile”). He wants to show that we all have the potential for direct happiness.

During the time of Jesus, there was no Pope obviously.

In fact, Jesus said, “The kingdom of God is within you.”

Jesus was speaking to the Jewish layman of the time. But now he might even say, “the choice for freedom is within you, and not anyone else.”

And that’s why the Pope takes a selfie.

Quote from him: “Depicting the Pope as a sort of Superman, a star, is OFFENSIVE to me. The pope is a man who laughs, cries, sleeps calmly and has friends like everyone else. A normal person.”

D) HE MAKES PHONE CALLS

Two years ago, a young woman was pressured by her husband to have an abortion. She said, “no”, and got divorced.

She was depressed. She wrote the Pope.

A few weeks later the phone rang. She picked it up.

“Hello,” the other side said, “it’s Pope Francis.” He comforted her and then baptized the newborn when it was born.

He regularly makes calls to the people who write him, shedding the layers of bureaucracy that have existed for almost 2000 years in the Vatican.

How often we forget the immense benefits a simple touch makes.

The most impressive display of beauty is not the Sistine Chapel, with God reaching to grasp the first man… but a man reaching out to touch a single woman who needed help.

How many of us do that simple act, the creation of art and beauty, every day? I don’t. But I should.

D) HE HATES THE NEWS

“The media only writes about the sinners and the scandals, but that’s normal, because a tree that falls makes more noise than a forest that grows.”

The media sells subscriptions. But every day we have a choice. To focus on what is growing in our lives, or the negativity and fear that try to bring us down.

Another quote: “How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure but it is news when the stock market loses two points?”

E) THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF MAN

There are something like 8 million species on Earth. We always think of ourselves as somehow “king” of the food chain.

Maybe we are and maybe we aren’t. After all, we made the definition of the phrase “food chain” so why not make ourselves king of it.

Certainly many species are not even aware of us.

Nor is it so great that we are supposedly, “intelligent”. How many high IQ people are truly happy and free and live every day with well-being.

Francis’ quote: “No one can grow if he does not accept his smallness.”

F) HE TEACHES PEOPLE TO CHOOSE THEMSELVES

We know that happiness is not related to money. Countless studies have shown this.

Often it’s related to our mindset. To the choices we make. Again, when someone asked me why not worry about tomorrow, there is no real answer. Why should I?

Francis quote: “This is the struggle of every person: be free or be a slave.”

Even if you are stuck at the bottom of solitary confinement in jail, you can still choose to be free inside your spirit.

This is not self-help BS. This is your choice: do you be miserable or do you root yourself in your inner freedom? Why choose to be miserable?

And yet, often when I wake up in the morning, all my past memories suck me in as quickly as possible and it’s an effort not to say “ugh”.

Then I’m a slave again. It’s a practice every day to choose freedom.

G) HE SECRETLY READS MY EMAILS

His quote: “Living together is an art. It’s a patient art, it’s a beautiful art, it’s fascinating.”

How does he know that Claudia and I recently had a horrible argument.

It was so painful. I couldn’t even function for days. We don’t argue a lot and when we do I feel like my heart bursts open.

Do you ever feel like that? Like you argue with someone and the only way out of it is to crawl into a cave. To disappear and not even think until the storm seems to pass.

But it does pass. And you figure your way through the maze to find a greater intimacy.

I don’t brag about it. I hate arguing. I don’t ever want to. I’d honestly rather have less intimacy in my life than argue to find greater intimacy.

But when it’s there I do feel like we just made a work of art.

H) HE DOESN’T TEACH FEAR

For all I know he is an atheist. I can’t find one quote from him about hell or damnation.

In my view (and I may be wrong, it doesn’t matter to me) he uses the word “god” as a placeholder for “well-being”.

Many studies show that the key to contentment and confidence is three things:

Growing competence in a pursuit you love

Strengthening every day the relationships around you

Increasing your freedom of choices.

Quote from the Pope: “If we start without confidence, Already we have lost half the battle and we bury our talents.”

I) HE THINKS LIKE THE DALAI LAMA

A friend of mine who is a believer in Tibetan Buddhism and has spent much time with the Dalai Lama once told me this: “when you are with the Dalai Lama you feel as if he loves you the way a mother loves her baby.”

Quote from Francis: “To protect every man and every woman, to look upon them with tenderness and love, is to open up a horizon of hope.

It is to let a shaft of light break through the heavy clouds; it is to bring the warmth of hope!”

J) LIVE BY EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF PREACHING

Imagine you’ve had a hard day at your construction site. You finally get a break, sit down with your friends, and break out your lunch.

A man walks by. He’s tired also from his job. He leaves the crowd surrounding him and asks you and your friends if he can join you for lunch.

He pulls out his lunchbox also and starts eating and talking to you.

He lives in a simple studio, drives a simple car, and refuses all gifts anyone gives him.

He’s the Pope and this happened.

Quote: “These two criteria are like the pillars of true love: deeds, and the gift of self.”

He doesn’t just say it. He lives it.

It doesn’t matter if you are Jewish on the holiest day of the year. It doesn’t matter if you are an atheist. It doesn’t matter if you are Christian, or Catholic.

Pope Francis lives a message. I wish every day I could try to live closer to that same message.

K) HIS NAME IS HIS ENTIRE BELIEF SYSTEM

He chose the name Francis when he became Pope because of Francis of Assisi. How come?

He explains:

“Francis of Assisi loved, helped and served the needy, the sick and the poor; he also cared greatly for creation.”

To me, this is the entire belief system of Pope Francis. He did not use the words “god” or “jesus” or “spirit” above.

This is all anyone needs to transform a life of fear and stress and anxiety and regret into a life of well-being and happiness.

Sometimes I think I’m not a good person. Sometimes I look at people on the street and hate them for no reason. Sometimes I’m not as good as I could be to family or friends.

But I’m trying to be better. I hope every day I can wake up and remind myself of Francis’s exact words above.

“To care greatly for creation” is the essence of choosing yourself instead of letting anyone else do it for you.

Instead of being held back by judgments or anger or fear or regret.

Maybe one day I will be able to live in a studio, call people who need help, eat lunch with strangers, take selfies with whoever.

For now, I write blog posts. And maybe tomorrow I’ll die.",https://medium.com/the-mission/is-pope-francis-an-atheist-and-ten-other-things-i-learned-from-him-84431632b5d4,['James Altucher'],2015-09-23 15:24:30.904000+00:00,"['Religion', 'Christianity']"
Can We Be Free Of Suffering?,"Question: Can we ever be free of suffering?

Response: I’ll answer your question by looking at a slightly different question.

Can we achieve world peace?

I think most people would have to answer no. It’s the practical, realistic answer. Why is that? Well peace is the opposite of (or compliment to) conflict. Can you imagine any point in time where there are living beings and there is no conflict? Each being, having unique and varying interests will invariably come in conflict with others. It will be over resources, love interests, property, right of way, or who gets that last piece of pie.

Even if everyone were enlightened, compassionate, selfless people, conflict would arise. World peace is practically impossible, because peace as a permanent condition is not possible.

Now let’s reflect on the original question in the light of the one on peace. Can we be free of suffering? From a Buddhist perspective, freedom from suffering requires a delicate balance. This balance supports the transcendence of suffering.

But we also must contend with impermanence. All balances are dynamic, and suffering and freedom from it is no exception. Even the great sages have ups and downs, good days, bad days, and so on. We are constantly traversing the stages of dependent arising, moving from suffering to cessation of suffering and back again.

We have to adopt the practical answer to the question. There is no end state of freedom from suffering. It is not a permanent condition. We will suffer on some days and other less so. Can we achieve freedom from suffering? Yes. Will we regress into suffering? Yes. Just like the weather in New England. If you don’t like it, wait 5 minutes.

Understanding the FED. What’s all this about Interest Rates??,"The United States Central Bank (FED) has the ability to raise and lower interest rates. Interest rates have a profound and far reaching effect on the economy and, recently, FED Chairwomen Janet Yellen made her address to Congress and talked about the potential of the FED beginning to ‘normalize,’ that is to say raise, interest rates before the end of 2015, possibly in the summer. This data-story aims at clarifying some of the different considerations the FED takes when choosing whether or not to raise interest rates and why, in particular, they are not raising them, yet.

While other indicators and influences in the economy have appeared to improve, inflation has remained sluggish over the past 2 and a half years. Inflation reflects an active economy. When people have more money, when they feel more optimistic about the economy, they start to spend and the increased demand will start to raise prices. So when the FED sees lower inflation than their 2% annual goal, it causes them to pause and think twice about raising rates.

If the FED were to raise interest rates it would without any doubt lead to even lower inflation. Raising interest rates causes liquidity in the market to decrease, leading to lower spending, leading to lower inflation. The less than ideal inflation over the past few years is probably the best explanation for why the FED has not raised interest rates up until this point.

Most anyone will tell you that a good indicator in the economy is unemployment. The normal unemployment that is reported on regularly in the media and the oval office is U3. But, as you can infer from this graph, it is not the only way of measuring unemployment. U6 is another such way and it is calculated by taking U3 and adding to it workers who are in part-time work that would like a full-time job.

Normally, the majority of people would be satisfied with the standard measure of unemployment, but during the financial crisis, the number of people who were pressured into part-time work rose relative to the people who were completely without work. This led to a small debate on whether or not U3 is a good indicator of the current job market because it failed to take into account this uncharacteristically high U6. Notice how the ‘Difference’ line, which shows the difference between U6 and U3, rose at the end of 2008 and has not returned to pre-recession levels.

When the FED looks at unemployment, they are optimistic looking at U3 but will pause when looking at U6. All this being said, it is important to remember that unemployment is a lagged indicator. In other words, the economy might have improved but it can take time for that improvement to be reflected in unemployment because hiring is not instantaneous.

To take another view, Yellen recently met with a more conservative group who would like to see the rate raised sooner rather than later. By keeping the interest rates low for so long, it has actually begun to hurt employment rather than helping it. When capital has been as cheap as it has been, it makes it more likely that business can invest in physical capital rather than more employees. The firms are likely to take out a loan and buy a machine to do the work because they will never see loan interest rates so low after the FED acts. Add this to minimum wage hikes and companies like Mcdonalds are much more likely to hire a touch screen payment system rather than a cashier.

Wage growth is similar to unemployment in what it says about the economy but not the same. A tightening labor market, meaning more and more people have jobs, will result in higher wages as employees can start to ask for more money as the scarcity of their skills increases. For the past 4 or 5 years, wage growth has hovered around 2%, barely keeping up with inflation. Wage growth is one of the key indicators that continues to lag, resulting in the FED being ‘patient’ about raising interest rates. If the data for 2015 start to show more substantial wage growth, we can be much more confident about normalization occurring before the year’s end.

This graph shows the US Labor Force Participation Rate. The rate is now the lowest it has been in over 3 decades and many people are unsure of the cause. One of the main explanations going around is that the baby boomers are starting to retire. This could account for some of the decline but not all. The long term effect of more and more people not working on the American economy could be drastic. As more and more people go on welfare or other government subsides it could seriously dampen the long term finances of the nation. A lagging LFPR is yet another reason why the FED decided to not raise the rates just yet.

Interest and bond prices have an inverse relationship. When the FED lowers interest rates, what they are really doing is buying bonds with newly printed money. So instead of there being a piece of debt floating around in the market (the bond) there is new money. The FED starts buying bonds, the increased demand causes bond prices to go up which in turn makes interest rates go down because of the aforementioned relationship.

This is why the FED Balance Sheet looks like it does above. The longer that the FED continues to hold interest rates down, the more debt they will accumulate. This amount of debt has never been seen in the FED’s history and it has raised questions about the risks associated with a central bank holding so much debt. Many wonder if there will be long term consequences if the FED does not curb their current intake of debt.

Take Away

Many different factors affect when the FED will finally raise rates. Without a doubt, it is getting closer to doing so, but if certain factors of the economy do not improve this and the next period (Q1 and Q2 2015) they could postpone it even further. The most important incoming data to watch will be wage growth and inflation. When these factors in particular start to normalize the FED will begin to raise interest rates.

"My Generation is Just Awful, and Colleges are Making it Worse","Millions of narcissistic little jerks, reared by an uncommonly hysterical generation who instilled in their children the adamantine conviction that they are exceptional and necessarily worthy of respect, enrolled this week as freshman in universities across the United States.

There was a moment when this exercise might have tested these students, made better and new through confrontation with the uncomfortable and occasionally outrageous thought.

Now, instead, they will pass the next four years of pseudo-scholarship as they have the eighteen that preceded them: swaddled in institutionalized political correctness and protected always from the unconventional or provocative.

At two- and four-year colleges and universities all across the nation, administrators have adopted stringent “speech codes” that restrict speech and behavior otherwise explicitly protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

The result isn’t simply an emotionally delicate dolt, but a broader culture at jeopardy of losing the most foundational of human rights. Today’s over-sensitivity to offense means these students may be entirely desensitized to the loss of speech tomorrow, even in the face of gross government encroachment.

These speech codes stretch from the ludicrous, like Jacksonville State University’s* policy that students not offend anyone, to the plainly unlawful.

While regarded by administrators as a sort of legal prophylactic — if no one is offended, no one can bring suit against the university, the argument goes — these policies have actually invited serious and sustained litigation by students and civil liberties advocates.

According to a national policy review of more than 400 institutions of higher learning by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a not-for-profit educational foundation, more than half of those schools with speech codes would not survive judicial review.

In the case of FIRE, some 36 schools have abandoned or severely restrained their speech codes after the group brought suit on behalf of aggrieved students and faculty whose right to lawful speech were infringed.

They’ve won, repeatedly, because the privilege not to be offended is no right at all. Moreover, intellectual discomfort is a necessary tool in emotional and scholastic development — and restrictive speech codes actively retard the process.

I should know: it wasn’t so long ago that I advanced from a parochial secondary school, wherein students were taught that man and dinosaur had once coexisted before a great flood washed the earth clean, to a monstrous state university where students learned genuine science.

This science was accepted, corroborated, quantifiable, and yet also deeply offensive to a child whose narrow appreciation for the world around him was fixed in young earth Creationism.

But my offense led to introspection, and in turn growth.

The new climate of institutionalized over-sensitivity that today plagues academia — the accepted belief that one has the right to never be offended — is so acute that dissent of any sort is not allowed. These policies require either conformity or silence, and they result in a dangerous chilling of the free exchange of ideas.

Millennials, the obnoxious selfie-snapping age cohort into which I was cursed to fall, are truly horrible enough without your help, academia. KTHXBAI.

She began to enjoy strange flavors, beginning with snuck slices of raw potato tongued from the edge of a paring knife. It was March, a week after snowmelt, empty plastic bags scuttling along neighborhood streets, all in the same direction, like pilgrims headed for Mecca. The chalk mouthfeel of a potato piece lifted from a cutting board echoed the fuzzy, waterlogged gaps in her consciousness, moments she found herself sitting on the couch reading a decorating magazine, not knowing where the day had drained.

As a girl, she had liked to slide single spears of grass from the lawn, slow enough to leave the fragrant root intact. She would bite the root with precision, falling backward through the taste of raw milk and sunshine.

After the potatoes came cravings for distilled vinegar, dahlia petals, and then the soap. What appealed to her most was a new, just-opened bar. Cardboard flaps opened at the bottom of the box, inside the soap bar packaged like candy in a plastic pocket that crinkled at the pressure of her fingertips. The torn, clear barrier, then the smooth, rectangular cake weighting the palm of her hand.

Under the sink she kept stacks of soap packaged individually in green cardboard boxes. These she purchased in loads of twenty with a fifty percent off coupon, shopping cart heavy as she trollied it toward the checkout.

One Sunday morning, opening a new soap for her shower, she took a bite.

Simple. Her teeth scraped the rounded edge once, twice, and a chunk of soap crumbled onto her tongue. The sharp taste boomeranged at the base of her skull. She was awake.

She stood naked in front of the bathroom mirror, watching herself chew soap, and her husband opened the door without knocking. He saw it in her hands, the wrapper peeled halfway down like an ice cream bar. There were white flakes gathering at the corners of her lips.

“What are you doing?” he asked. Her mouth was full.",https://medium.com/revolver-reader/clean-b09390ab9dcc,['Kasey Payette'],2015-11-20 16:47:44.172000+00:00,"['Literature', 'Short Story', 'Fiction']"

"Parliaments, picnics and social cleansing: a walk in London","Sometimes walking up and down hills is the only way to truly try and understand what’s happening in the city around you, writes Matt Tidby.

The view from Primrose Hill. Photo: Richard Kaby via Flickr CC

I’m pretty good at walking. I enjoy exploring places on foot — I once spent a full day finding Coventry utterly fascinating, which is no small achievement. Last year, I moved to London. In such a sprawl, it can be difficult to perceive and appreciate the social and historical value of even your immediate surroundings — let alone try to think about the place as a terrifying, multitudinous whole. So, I’ve started walking about. This Easter bank holiday, spring had sprung, so I jumped on a train to Gospel Oak and climbed Parliament Hill — intent on walking from there, via Primrose Hill, to its namesake in Westminster.

The view from Parliament Hill is a hazy east-west panorama of blue smudges — the city still feels distant, but I was distracted — I had seen someone whom I thought was Josie Long on the Overground a few minutes before and had promptly tripped extravagantly whilst disembarking. Pride suitably prodded, I set out down the hill and out the park; past children doing earnest laps of the athletics track, past fedora-topped characters openly smoking cannabis within waft of the ice cream van queue.

The walk towards Primrose Hill took me through the gargantuan mansions of Belsize Park, down the aptly titled England’s Lane — itself a coldly concise summary of London’s housing crisis. The average asking price for a property here, amongst the designer eateries and near-toxic levels of chic, is a spicy £2.1 million. Yet, at the top of the road, sits the squat and uninspiring redbrick form of the England’s Lane Hostel, where Camden Council ‘temporarily’ houses its homeless families — often for years at a time.

I stopped for a moment on the opposite side of the street, watching the Bank Holiday coffee crowds luxuriating in the sunshine. A recent burst of resistance to social housing evictions, with occupations from Barnet in the North to Stratford in the East, has been a strong and uplifting rallying cry against the wilful disassembly of working class communities. However, it may ultimately be in vein — with council’s facing increasingly taut financial boundaries, and with ‘Right to Buy’ rearing its ugly head once more, the incontinence of London’s property gold rush may already have burst the dam.

The trouble with England. Photo: Bex Walton via Flickr CC

Reaching Primrose Hill, I meet my first proper crowds. Appropriately for Easter, there’s something pleasingly occult-ish about the clamour of sun worshippers atop the summit of the park. The more ostentatious among them have gone the whole hog with wicker and wine — reclining to survey the eclectic swinging dick spires of their capital.

To avoid being accused of looking sideways at nearby romantic entanglements, I focus on the skyline — as ever, feeling sorry for St. Paul’s amongst its charmless looming neighbours, whilst furtively admiring the Pyongyangian protuberance of the Shard. London is in the white heat of a skyscraper boom — clusters of chrome dugtrios are bursting upwards, with the number of buildings over twenty storeys set to double. Quotas of “affordable” housing have been established to prevent these glittering upstarts being the sole estate of the rich, but developers are becoming savvy to avoidance manoeuvres.

Speaking of which — eventually, the couples begin daubing their naked torsos in pentagonal patterns, ready for the ever-popular sacrificial dance at sundown. Before I get short-listed for the slab, I potter down the hill and into the Regent’s Park.

Beyond the boulevards and blossom of the park, and in a fit of self-punishment for not having the foresight to bring a picnic hamper, I elect to take a direct route to Westminster — following Portland Place and Regent’s Street, past the doom-destined horseshoe of Broadcasting House and into the crowds proper. For the first time, my pace slows. At one point, within the echo of an earnest Oxford Circus beatboxer, I become trapped amongst an enclave of Spanish teenagers, who appear to have set up their own static autonomous state on the borders of Banana Republic. I manage to traffic myself out by jumping into the bus lane. I nearly lose a foot to a Tuk Tuk outside Hamley’s, and decide that enough is enough.

I dive down a lane of tradesman’s entrances, emerging into the comparative silence of Messrs Carnaby and Beak — Soho, increasingly encroached upon, still manages to cushion the chrome-steel horrors that mass upon its borders. A campaign to preserve the cultural role of the area has gained national attention. However, just as with the mothers of E15 and the homeless of England’s Lane, the burrowing claws of cash may be too deeply entwined in the fabric of Soho to preserve her tapestry indefinitely.

I skate across Piccadilly Circus without looking up — its piazza of pizzazz looking grubbed and tawdry under the glare of sobriety. Within moments, the garishness recedes to be replaced by another kind of brazen monumentalism. From Waterloo Place, adjacent to the dusty halls of the Royal Society, a party of statues — Captain Scott, Florence Nightingale, Edward VII and others — welcome me to Westminster proper.

With an election looming, there’s something unfathomably pregnant about the Palace of Westminster. With the civil service off darning their socks in the bank holiday sunshine, the silence of Whitehall evokes the possibility of more ‘There’s no money left’ notes, patiently waiting on desks. I skirt the rear along Horseguard’s Parade, to get my favourite view of Downing Street. From here, that sun-kissed coalition rose garden, for all the power it contains, can be seen for what it is — the modest yard of a lonely, besieged terraced house, behind barbed wire and security gates. It looks like somewhere to dig out of, not commit your life to get in to.

I walk into Parliament Square from Great George Street, and tweet my delight at being out in the sunshine, having done enough exercise to permit the consumption of a quite indecent volume of banana loaf once home. London, for all its grace and comedy, is fundamentally flawed — a great city, but a victim of its success. Our national media are delighted to blame London’s problems on the crowd — particularly those in social housing, or the 37% of its residents born outside the UK.

But any walk in London, whichever way you go, makes it plainly obvious that the greatest threat to the future of our capital is capital itself. It saturates every edifice — a groundswell of finance, flooding our commercial thoroughfares and communities alike. And in the grand tradition of apocalyptic storytelling, this catastrophe can often be best seen from the surrounding hills, of Parliament and Primrose.",https://medium.com/abstract-magazine/parliaments-picnics-and-social-cleansing-a-walk-in-london-6e6d74ac06f4,['Matt Tidby'],2015-11-28 13:01:14.945000+00:00,"['London', 'Life']"
Mindfulness changed my life.,"In the last 18 months I’ve spent a life-defining amount of time abroad. I’ve gone from being an advertising professional who loves clothes shopping and lives in a shared-ownership flat in zone 2; to one of the co-founders of a social entrepreneurship training business, creating the next generation of social entrepreneurs. With no regular abode.

In 6 months we’ve ran a pilot in Kenya alongside two volunteer consultants; to collaborating with over 45 volunteers from 10 different countries — in four different emerging economies. I’ve spent more time shuffling through checkpoints than I have in Tesco Metro searching for discounted wine.

Over the last two years I’ve had a fairly good stab at disrupting my life’s status quo, and you could argue that maybe now I’ve gotten it the right way around.

Looking back, I remember how the future always seemed like this thing I was striving to get to. I was often planning ahead, fantasising, wistfully longing for this thing called ‘The Dream’. John Green writes in his novel Looking for Alaska,

“You spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth, thinking about how you’ll escape one day, and how awesome it will be — and imagining that future keeps you going, but you never do it. You just use the future to escape the present.”

If that doesn’t kick you in the gut, I suspect these words from John Lennon will:

“Life is what happens when you are busy making other plans”.

For many years it would be fair to say that great things were happening around me (loving family, awesome friends, adventures and romance), but I felt like I was caught in a stop motion film. I think it’s plausible that until we discover our true selves, we’ll always be chasing something — never quite satisfied with our lot. That was me, until last year when I started _SocialStarters. I now feel like I’m playing the starring role in my own life. And how did I get there? Well, it’s was very simple.

I found my own way back to myself.

Seemingly, I’d gotten a little lost somewhere along the way.

Thanks to a brilliant boss (they do exist!) I went to a Mindfulness meditation course targeting people with busy lives. By that point I had a permanent twitch in my eye and kept crying at my desk.

But why? This quote from mental health advocate du jour Ruby Wax offers one perspective:

“We are not equipped for this century, it’s too hard, too fast, and too full of fear; we just don’t have the bandwidth. Our brains can’t take so much information in a world where we’re bombarded by bad news and force-fed information. I can just about take in the weather then i’m exhausted. You open a newspaper, everyone’s dead.”

I think the situation is worse though — we’re responding to emails on our phone at the same time as opening that newspaper, whilst trying not to get knocked out the train. We’re tweeting between whatsapps and instagrams, juggling multiple conversations across different platforms (and not always with people we know!) — whilst eating & catching fragments of TV.

Big statement alert. Mindfulness changed my life. Without wanting to belittle anyone’s head pains, I think whoever we are, we could all do with a ‘defrag’ every now and again. And Meditation taught me that we can put our mind clutter and anxieties to one side. I was in control of my thoughts, actually in control of them — and not the other way around — which was a profound realisation for me. My mind started to quieten. And a new, more confidant, authentic voice came through.

Inspired by Ruby Wax, who’s book Sane New World charts her career change from comedy to brain chemistry, I learned about depression and the positive impact that mindfulness has on the mind. It’s not a cure for depression but a coping mechanism that helps you find your own answers. Through additional support from a coach and a specialist therapist, I realised that my core values and the things I was truly passionate about, weren’t the starring role in my life, causing internal conflict. Over time I had manifested enough distractions to avoid a fear-based mis-truth that I wasn’t good enough. Only my lifestyle was letting it get louder. I’d become my own worst enemy.

Keeping a blog about this journey of self discovery was extremely cathartic and validated my passion for experiential sharing. It also felt as much a part of the process as the experiences I was having. I’d always wanted to write; but ended up in sales. Although now I see how those two things are closely entwined. Marketing, isn’t good marketing without brilliant storytelling, right?

So how did I make that career change? Volunteering connected me to causes that mattered to me. I found www.do-it.org and Escape the City. I started mentoring short term offenders, young entrepreneurs and creatives. I got a job at a social enterprise opening me up to a whole new world.

The start of my relationship with my business partner Anna Moran came when I went to a talk by Escape on ‘How to launch a social enterprise overseas’. This set in motion a chain of serendipitous events resulting in us both volunteering in Kenya, passionate about solving the same problem. It’s really amazing what can happen when you say yes to a new opportunity!

So the biggest piece of advice I could give to someone feeling a bit lost, uninspired, curious or unchallenged (and it’s by no means exhaustive); is grab every suggestion, recommendation or invitation that comes your way. From books to networking events to Ted Talks. Take some time out. Connect the dots with your past. Make amends. With each experience you learn something new that can only widen your network of opportunity. Then design a life for yourself that works for you.

As our third cohort of trainee Social Enterprise Consultants prepare to collaborate in Hyderabad, with app developers, teachers, environmentalists and social entrepreneurs, there is still a lot still to do — but we’re getting messages every week from former classmates, colleagues and old friends asking ‘can I join you?’. So our strapline has become a simple invitation to #JoinUs.

Everyone’s journey is different but I do believe the universe has a magical way of presenting you with answers, you just have to be able to see them (and act on them) when they come your way.

And don’t be afraid to think differently. Reminding me of Malcolm Gladwell and Tim Ferris here’s some inspiring words from one of my favourite ad campaigns by apple from back in 1997:

“Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”

Setting out the sales stall,"The Ford Factory 1908

With the arrival of the factory came the mass market. Factories made it possible to produce products and trade resources on a scale far greater than anything previously thought possible.

So, with the mass market came mass marketing, needed to drive sales. Technology also created the means for that to take root. Industrialization had led to unprecedented levels of material security and wealth. At the same time, factory methods and mechanization meant that the production of goods and services was becoming infinite.

There was no economic motive to switch them off, either. The problem, if anything, was over-supply. Factories were able to produce goods and products indefinitely, powered by conveyor belts that didn’t stop, so consumer demand required constant stimulation.

Mass media and the rise of consumer marketing was the price the new working class paid for having been lifted out of uncertainty and starvation by machinery.

The public relations efforts begun by Edward Bernays (there’s more on that in the previous post), were soon supplemented by a range of advertising media in the 20th Century that fed the factory engine very well and their focus was entirely on stimulating and promoting consumer demand.

Marketing beyond word-of-mouth first arrived in the form of flyers, poster hoardings and press advertising in the second half of the 19th Century. In the 20th Century, these were joined by radio and cinema commercials, before TV advertising arrived on the scene in the 1940’s.

Mass media has its moment

Radio, film and television were all new and highly dynamic forms of media that offered exciting ways of sense-making and storytelling.

Between the 1880’s and 1930’s C.E., rapid developments in media, at least compared to previous years, had meant that silent movies had become talkies and static pictures had become animated.

Thanks to Edwaerd Muybridge, we transitioned from photography to film. Where communication had been flat, now it moved. This led to the motion picture industry.

And then, in the 1950’s, where moving imagery had been black and white, now it was, here, in glorious technicolour.

Satisfying the appetite of the factory line

The growth of marketing communications and media management have been one biggest economic success stories the world has seen over the last 70 years.

When consumerism served to fill the vacuum following the end of the war effort after 1945, a post-war economic boom, driven by the producing, selling and buying of products and services, acted like an adrenalin shot in the arm for the world-wide economy.

As the post-war age began, marketing bloomed. And the twin turbos of technology and economics were powering it.

As a result of needing to encourage the consumption of factory output, media communications in the 1950’s and 1960’s ushered in a golden age of consumer marketing. Television and cinema seemed to make life more fantastical.

Advertising was becoming an ever-present feature on the intersections of busy streets. Soap operas stories, with products attached, came into the living room as part of an entertainment narrative. They introduced an open-ended story format for audiences, brought to them by a commercial sponsor.

The narrative to ‘tune in next week’ was beginning to play.",https://medium.com/emergent-code/setting-out-the-sales-stall-26dc575b5107,['Anne Mccrossan'],2015-11-23 10:54:29.115000+00:00,"['Communications', 'Innovation', 'Media']"
Why I won’t be live-tweeting “The Vaccine War” from Frontline on PBS,"Back in 2010, PBS put out a documentary called “The Vaccine War” as part of their “Frontline” show. It wasn’t a bad documentary. It looked at the different reasons why parents refuse to vaccinate their children as well as at the science that has proven time and again that vaccines are far, far more beneficial than detrimental to our health.

Yes, there are those who have had vaccine reactions that could be classified as “detrimental,” no one worth their salt will deny it. But the number and proportion of these reactions is much lower than what “antivaxxers” will have us believe. Also, there is no association between vaccines and autism, no matter what people like Andrew Wakefield or Brian S. Hooker want you to believe.

Yesterday, I received an email from Shauna Stuart. She identified herself as being associated with Frontline. She emailed me to see if I wanted to live-tweet during the updated version of “The Vaccine War” on Tuesday (March 24, 2015). While I do engage people on social media about science in general and vaccine science in particular, I have mixed feelings about being involved in this.

First, I’d be giving PBS and Frontline free advertising. I have a little over 1,500 followers on Twitter. While not all of them would likely be reached by my tweets, many of them would. They would then be tempted to check out the show and, thus, drive more viewers to the show. After all, it is a television show, and it is funded in part by the number of people watching it. By live-tweeting the show, I’d be driving up their viewership… For free.

Second, television shows like these (documentaries or not) are quick to invite members of “the other side” to discuss these issues. When it comes to vaccines, the science has been settled. We have in place a system whereby vaccines that come to market do so after rigorous testing. Once they’re out to the public, we have a system for tracking adverse events. We also have a legion of epidemiologists (from governments and public/private institutions) looking at the effect(s) of vaccines on the diseases they’re intended to prevent.

Inviting people from “the other side” only muddies the waters and makes informed decisions harder by injecting fantasies and fears into the discussion. Parents and individuals who may be “on the fence” about vaccinating might actually give credence to an antivaxxer — no matter how outlandish their claims — because, hey, they were on Frontline. PBS wouldn’t have invited them if their claims didn’t have some truth to them, would it?

I’m yet to see a PBS show about the Apollo Moon landings where people who deny the landings are given ample opportunity to spread their theories. There has been no PBS show that I know of where people who believe in the Reptilian Conspiracy when there is a show about politics or the British Monarchy. And I am sure that shows about HIV/AIDS in Africa has not included AIDS denialists… Or, if they have had such shows, I haven’t watched them.

You see, things like these need to be settled through education. They cannot be settled through television shows. Can we have a discussion about it? Sure, but including the “other side” on such a serious issue can have consequences. Allowing Jenny McCarthy or Andrew Wakefield to tell a wide audience that vaccines cause autism has demonstrably led to lower rates of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination. Allowing similar people to tell us that autism is a “horrible” disease (or even just a disease) where children are “lost” or “dead” or something similar has demonstrably led to autistic children being treated like less than human. There have been cases where autistic children have been killed by their parents or caretakers because “lost” or “dead” children don’t have a future, in their minds.

No, PBS, I will not be live-tweeting your show. I’m not even going to tune in. The “Vaccine War” is not a fair war when conspiracy theories trump evidence. When antivaxxers can accuse people like me of serious crimes and threaten to take away my livelihood, and then you give them an enormous stage to continue to spread their bullshit, you are complicit in making the war even more unfair. A fair war would be to allow science and evidence and reason to guide the discussion, not the fear and misinformation spread far and wide by antivaxxers.

I’d rather spend that time studying for my doctoral oral exams. That will benefit public health 100 times more than a television show where antivaxxers are given a voice.",https://medium.com/rebel-public-health/why-i-won-t-be-live-tweeting-the-vaccine-war-from-frontline-on-pbs-978adbc2048e,"['Rene F.

5 Tips to Write a Strong Personal Branding Statement,"Originally posted on the Strikingly Blog on June 8, 2015.

As far as personal branding goes, there is one relatively easy, concrete, and crucial thing that can consolidate your image, make a lasting impression on others, and even help steer your career direction — a personal branding statement.

Nowadays potential clients, hires, and collaborators will Google you and research you online, before even thinking of reaching out for an inquiry or interview. (Think about it — don’t we all?) They will have an image of who you are and what you do, before ever surfacing on your radar. This could work for or against you. How do you position yourself positively?

The first and best action plan would be to create and publicize a personal website yourself, giving you control over what others find and learn about you when they look you up online. Another action might be to tidy up your image across social media; yet another would be to maintain accounts on platforms relevant to your work, like LinkedIn or Youtube. But all these these can be strengthened and spearheaded by a personal branding statement.

What is a Personal Branding Statement?

The personal branding statement is a synopsis, ranging from one to several sentences long, that defines and communicates your personal brand. It is your own vision of who you are, what do you, and what value you bring to others. It is a useful device that describes your most important endeavors, abilities, and accomplishments; at the same, it can reflect your personality, beliefs, and even your world view. Once formulated it can be cited and summoned anywhere, anytime, whether on your personal website, on social platforms, or in real conversations and communities.

Ready to give it a go? Here are our 5 tips on how to write a strong personal branding statement.

1) Make it conversational

Write your personal branding statement in a conversational tone, as if to a friend across the coffee table. The point is to make a connection, to generate some level of chemistry with the other person. So you want to convey your statement in a manner that is open and personable, rather than formalized behind a stone wall of professional propriety.

Avoid 3rd person — by definition it just doesn’t sound like it’s coming from you, which is contrary to the point of personal branding. Either go with 1st person to be friendly and inviting, or omit pronouns to set a sleek and deliberate tone. (“The name’s Bond. James Bond.”)

Generally avoid big words and highly technical descriptive phrases. You need to craft your personal branding statement with real people in mind, on the receiving end. Being simple and human is likely to impress and resonate with people more than trying to project overly intense authority. “I save infant kangaroos” will work better than “I resuscitate fledgling marsupials”. Keep it friendly — save the advanced detail and jargon for those who know enough, and are interested enough, to read more deeply into you.

Practice saying it aloud to someone as you write your statement, since you will actually be doing that from time to time. If it sounds natural and substantive, then it is!

Mohamed’s personal branding statement is friendly, genuine, and memorable.

2) Stay sensible. Stay classy.

It’s easy to sort of let go in your language and imagination when writing a personal statement, especially for the young and casual . But the way you talk with your closest friends, or the role you see yourself playing in a movie someday in some multiverse, should not necessarily be incorporated into your personal branding statement. Those yearnings must be checked. While it is by all means good to write a personal branding statement that pleases and motivates yourself, you don’t want to cross the line and come off as flippant, thereby hurting your chances in front of potential leads.

No slang, emoji, or creative spelling and punctuation. Unless you are absolutely sure that is what appeals to your entire target audience.

Never, ever include highly sensitive or polarizing quips. Puns and references may be okay for certain professionals, but be cautious.

Don’t call yourself a guru, hero, ninja, or visionary unless you actually are one. If you have any inklings of doubt in calling yourself a “consulting samurai”, then I’m afraid you probably are not one yet. Please stick with “consultant” for now.

Andre’s personal branding statement is young and charismatic, but professional at the same time.

3) Write your statement in bit-sized, movable parts.

Think Ironman’s armor — you want to assemble your personal branding statement in detachable, standalone parts, so that you can select and adapt various bits depending on the platform and purpose. One size does not fit all — you may need your statement lightened for social media, shortened for an email signature tagline, lengthened for your career bio, or specially focused for particular conversations. Always going with your full-on personal branding statement, regardless of the situation, will likely cause awkward interactions and missed opportunities at points.

Your personal branding statement doesn’t need to be perfect. You will naturally find yourself tinkering with your statement over time to reflect changes and advancements in your life and career, especially if those trajectories are still shifting. For the purposes of continuity and fluidity, it’s definitely preferable to tweak and improve bits of your personal branding statement, than have to periodically throw out and reinvent the whole thing.

Chiara’s personal branding statement comes in bite-sized parts. She can mix & match for different platforms and purposes, based on what she wants to emphasize.

4) Reflect your core values, beliefs, causes.

Impress with a voice that says: “It’s not just about me, but something much bigger”. Values, beliefs, and causes connect people on a deep level. It doesn’t matter whether you’re in a technical, artistic, business, or rice field — a mere few words revealing true personal culture, can connect even strangers more quickly and powerfully than polished descriptions of abilities and accomplishments. Take some time to realize what matters most to you, and convey that.

Samir’s personal branding statement doesn’t even start with himself, but his world view. You get a strong, inspiring sense of his beliefs, his way of thinking.

5) Show your unique value.

Above all, differentiate yourself. Weave a story that defines you uniquely; write a personal branding statement that could describe no one else but you. Because if not, and your statement is just a lifeless job description of your functional areas, then ultimately you are replaceable, unremarkable in the eyes of others. That would defeat the whole purpose of personal branding.

Showing your uniqueness and individuality is the best way to breathe life into your personal branding statement. Everyone has a unique set of values, passions, and attributes that drives them in work and in life. Know what it is that makes you the individual you are, and no one can ever dismiss that. That is what will make others want to know you, connect with you, and work with you.

Hannah’s personal branding statement feels genuine, passionate, and highly unique.

What will a person think about you — how will a person feel about you — when they read your personal branding statement? Is it impactful and impressionable enough for them to remember, and maybe repeat to their friends and contacts? These are important questions to ask, considering you will be judged by potential clients and collaborators — either favorably or negatively — based on your self-testimony. So spend some time formulating your personal branding statement. Make it conversational, classy, flexible, powerful, and unique. When you’re ready, incorporate it into your personal website, social media, and real life conversations. Your personal branding statement will become a trusty, lifelong compass and calling card.

In the early nineteenth century, a small population of free people of color speckled the United States. Some of them did not disrupt the status quo, but revolutionaries like Denmark Vesey of Charleston, South Carolina called for the nation to burn.

A founding member of Emmanuel AME Church, Vesey primarily recruited church members for the insurrection. His plan leaked to slave owners before he could make Charleston a site of liberation. The Mayor organized a militia to catch all co-conspirators. Vigilante justice reigned over the city too, but it did not stop for good. On June 17, 2015 self-proclaimed white supremacist Dylan Roof reignited that spirit of vigilante justice and murdered nine Emmanuel AME Church parishioners with the intent to start a race war nearly a century after Vesey planned his uprising.

Black people have long struggled for their freedom and civil rights in America. Denmark Vesey is an example of this. Therefore, uprisings across the nation after repeated incidents of white police officers shooting unarmed black citizens is not just an inciting 2015 headline. It falls along the continuum of black people protesting against state sanctioned violence and over policing in their communities. So why do museums continually hesitate in responding to Ferguson and Baltimore and Staten Island and Cleveland and Charleston and…?

Are Museums Really Ready to Respond to Ferguson?

In Bridget McKenzie’s Code:Words piece, “Toward the Sociocratic Museum”, McKenzie proposes a new model of museum to counter the existing plutocratic and bureaucratic archetypes that have arisen from plunder and oppression or are discomfitingly in bed with problematic corporate entities, respectively. In theory, the sociocratic museum would forego being participatory and engaging on its surface for “governance that is non-hierarchical, consent-based and rooted in its communities.” Recently, museums have championed inclusion and engagement. But the digital landscape and communities of color have pushed back, creating spaces that discuss their lived experience and critiquing how other people view it.

McKenzie’s piece cited #museumsrespondtoFerguson, a Twitter chat we co-host the third Wednesday of each month 1PMCST/2PMEST, as an example of how people-driven movements in the digital realm can inspire change in museums. In 2014, tens of thousands of Americans took to the streets protesting the killings of unarmed black citizens by police in Staten Island, Beavercreek, Ferguson, Cleveland, Baltimore (and unfortunately many more in subsequent months). These actions were inspired, organized, shared (and ultimately spied on) via a host of digital platforms, most notably Twitter, which has the highest percentage of black adult users according to recent research. It’s the digital equivalent of an old-school office water cooler. It’s where news breaks, information is shared, and racist tomfoolery is dragged to the carpet.

Claiming Their Space Digitally

“Eric Garner Protests” by Paul Silva, CC BY 2.0

#BlackLivesMatter, and other movements, rallied marginalized people and amplified their unified voices. They claimed virtual space instead of waiting for it to be doled out to them. Traditional gatekeepers were rendered moot. Schools, arts organizations, libraries, and other entities responded with public statements denouncing police brutality, presented related programs, or offered their venues as community gathering spaces.

The Joint Statement from Museum Bloggers & Colleagues on Ferguson and Related Events, from which #museumsrespondtoFerguson generated, was an industry call-to-arms, primarily asking museums in the United States to similarly reflect upon their internal oppressive practices and actively demonstrate their roles as change agents fully embedded in our nation’s social, educational, and cultural infrastructure. The forward to “Museums, Equality, and Social Justice” (Sandell and Nightingale, ed.) makes this responsibility explicit:

No matter what a museum’s legal structure, whether publicly funded, or authorised by society to function as a charity, it is expected to contribute to the common good. If its basic values do not include solidarity with the excluded, then the museum is reinforcing that exclusion.

Museums pride themselves on embodying the common good, on honoring its social compacts, and being physically and virtually relevant. Precious resources are devoted to “engagement”, a term so buzzy and overused that it often elicits groans and eye-rolls from museum employees tasked with bringing the nebulous concept to life.

These colleagues regularly communicate via tags such as #musesocial, #musetech, and #museEd to crowdsource solutions and exchange practices, so convening in digital spaces isn’t new. However, using those spaces to openly examine anti-blackness in museums certainly is.

Twitter: The Tool for Activists Online

“A Black Lives Matter protest of police brutality in the rotunda of the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota” by Nicholas Upton, CC BY-SA 2.0

Social activism is inherently risky but protest in the physical world can take place with a certain degree of professional protection. You can demonstrate outside of work hours or anonymously donate to causes of your choice. But participating in a Twitter chat explicitly dedicated to confronting your current or potential employers’ systemic oppression under your personal account, which might even include your image (and almost overwhelmingly some variation of a “these ideas are mine alone” disclaimer), is practically an act of rebellion in an industry with a long history of conformity, exclusion, and aversion to transparency.

The aforementioned Joint Statement was born digitally and continues to live online, making it more accessible than a paper document. Conversations responding to overarching themes like race, police brutality and community relations dominate the online landscape now. The monthly Twitter chat is a limb of the statement, keeping the conversation alive. Twitter has been the most appropriate online social media platform seeing that it is the most immediate and democratic.

Facebook, the most popular social media platform, originally started exclusively for Harvard students. Eventually, it expanded to a service for all Ivy League schools along with Stanford University. It was not until 2006 that anyone of appropriate age could join the site. Contrarily, Twitter has always allowed anyone with a valid email address to join the site. Anyone can build a sizeable audience without educational, economic or social weight.

While one of the high points of Twitter is that it very democratic, that aspect also hurts our ability to account for everyone engaged in the conversation. Twitter allows participants to see the full conversation. It also gives them the choice to be an onlooker without forcing them to participate. Because of this, we know there is a group of people who read the Tweets but do not contribute to the conversation. This is frustrating because it does not allow us to capture a complete sample of the comments surrounding certain themes.

To capture the Tweets that are present in the chat, we use Storify. While Storify provides a great summary of the chat, it does not retain tweets if a user deletes them. We are still researching the best tools for tracking tweets on a limited (i.e. no) budget. So far, NodeXL (visual) and TAGS (archiving) are possible contenders due to free, open source templates, although the TAGS archive reflects some bias in its often incomplete results.

Twitter is also useful in the sense that it’s immediate. It’s a space for discourse and thinking aloud in public. And it has a record for social change. Among many other times, Egyptians most notably used Twitter in 2011 to organize actions in hopes of overthrowing President Hosni Mubarak. Its record for serving as a platform for social change made it the top choice for housing #museumsrespondtoFerguson.

This particular Storify, which focused on museums and oppression illustrates how Twitter introduced new perspectives and sources outside the mainstream to some of our chat participants. Margaret Middleton noted, #BlackLivesMatter has completely transformed the way I see the world.” Through these chats, Twitter continues to demonstrate to us that we can spread information that disrupts traditional narratives quickly and effectively.

The Stutter-Step Between Hashtag to Action

“Eric Garner Protest 4th December 2014, Manhattan, NYC” by The All-Nite Images, CC BY-SA 2.0

For all the good Twitter is, it still presents some challenges. How do we move out of an online safe space, to a space of action? We did not even provide a Storify for our fifth chat which asked participants to share anti-blackness work they have engaged since being a part of #museumsrespondtoFerguson. There were barely any tweets to archive. Instead of seeing action, that particular chat pulled back a veneer and exposed fear and tepid hopes. After several chats, it seemed like participants were still unsure about how to respond to Ferguson. We have pushed for museums and museum professionals to first examine the ways they perpetuate or dismantle oppression. Before museums can truly engage communities, they have to do the internal work. To be sure, this work is not easy, and it is far more complex than providing a tidy and succinct list of ten steps to engage with the black community.

Some comments, like one that relegated #museumsrespondtoFerguson to being “about museum staff talking amongst themselves — not a bad thing, but seems tangential in some way to community engagement,” are discouraging. Museums can’t engage communities of color before acknowledging and working through their role in marginalizing black and brown people. Furthermore, museum professionals cannot continue to cite early museologists like John Cotton Dana without providing the context that Newark struggled with desegregating its public spaces.

While John Cotton Dana wrote about engaging all people and making collections accessible and relevant, black people were not necessarily included in this plan. Dana demonstrated progressive ideas about gender, but never explicitly advocated for race equity. This is the type of deconstruction that needs to take place before museums attempt to engage a community that they have historically turned away. Learning about the likes of Mabel Wilson, in addition to Dana, makes for a more thoughtful and relevant approach to engaging black communities. #museumsrespondtoFerguson seeks to expose participants to different voices and thought processes that museums continue to ignore.

The chat generates thoughtful commentary, and has also inspired #MuseumWorkersSpeak, a conversation about labor and equity in the field. However, participants express some hesitancy, and even fearfulness, in putting these conversations to action. This was especially evident in our fifth chat where participants could barely answer the questions because they had not actually put in work to evaluate or comment on. We have not found the best solution for moving the conversation to action. Jumping back to the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, participants in their online advocacy never hesitated to take action. Action was intuitive. They believed in change and were willing to work for it.

Maybe, in this country racial change is not intuitive. And while Twitter can foster productive conversations, it has not fostered enough tangible actions in the museum community. The Charleston Massacre unfortunately connects us to the nineteenth century motto of vigilante justice against black people. Museums can no longer view contemporary iterations of racialized violence as traumatic headlines too difficult to work through in their spaces. As organizations with renewed commitment to community engagement, #museumsrespondtoFerguson needs to manifest in gallery spaces, programming and outreach.",https://medium.com/code-words-technology-and-theory-in-the-museum/museums-blacklivesmatter-ba28c7111bec,['Adrianne Russell'],2015-09-21 01:12:59.342000+00:00,"['Activism', 'BlackLivesMatter', 'Museums']"
Beth Lisick On “Maybe This is My Thing!”,"So this month’s Emily Books pick is a book of short, hilarious essays by Beth Lisick called Yokohama Threeway. Beth has written four books, hosts a monthly storytelling series, is currently on our with Sister Spit, does comedy with Tara Jepsen, is an actress, a slam poet, a mom. So when I got to interview her for Emily Books, a lot of our discussion ended up being about work, success, failure, and trying to get by. I love what she had to say about all of it:

MO: I feel like reading the book, I came away from it feeling like it ended up being a really accurate portrait of like, “the gig economy” or work as a creative person. All the different jobs you’ve had —

BL: …Yeah my particular compendium of these things is very much related to trying to make money, trying to get somewhere, not knowing what I’m doing, being put in a situation — like that TV thing where they’re like, “Oh, you could be a TV host!’ and I’m like, “Okayyyy, maybe I could do that??” And just the constant humiliations of not knowing what I’m doing but forging ahead anyway.

MO: And feeling like, if something comes to you, you should say yes to it, because you never know…

BL: Exactly. Right. “Maybe this is my thing!” I think that there are people who live their lives like that and there are people who don’t. And I do feel like for all the insecurity that comes up, financially and otherwise, it’s worth it to me. I don’t know how to live any other way.

MO: The “maybe this is my thing” bit is one of my favorite parts of the book. It’s so real and I love it in the context of your bio. You host a monthly storytelling series, you’re writing a novel, you’re a spoken word poet, you’ve published five books, you’re one half of a comedy duo — you still have a million things.

BL: Yeah! And I’m sure I always will, and I like that. The ups and downs and the high points and low points of having a career as a writer and a performer — that’s just how it goes. I don’t know how many people that do these kind of things have the kind of story where they just keep getting bigger and keep getting more successful — you know Emily wrote that great thing about money and writing her novel and I thought that was so fucking cool. And closer to most people’s experience.

People want to see themselves as successful and doing well and comfortable and always making more money and getting more popular — or whatever it is — and I think I have always defined myself by the things that don’t go right as much as the things that do go right. And I really do feel like it’s an equal balance. And I feel like trying to hide the things that don’t go right is just…wrong and embarrassing.",https://medium.com/the-billfold/beth-lisick-on-maybe-this-is-my-thing-4dd10c5be1aa,"[""Meaghan O'Connell""]",2015-12-09 20:04:39.780000+00:00,"['Emily Books', 'Beth Lisick', 'Work']"
Boy Scouts and the Long-Overdue Demise of “Separate But Equal”,"Yesterday, the New York Times reported that a group of girls in California are requesting formal admission to the Boy Scouts. The girls, who call themselves the Unicorns, had been participating in activities with the Boy Scouts — and consistently winning contests and awards — before complaints from boys’ parents prompted the Boy Scouts to ban the Unicorns from many scouting activities.

One of the group’s members, 10-year-old Ella, told the New York Times:

“Because we’re girls we can’t participate with boys? When we get into the real world, we’re going to have to work with other people who are, like, not just girls … We can do the same things boys can … There’s no really ‘girl things’ or ‘boy things.”

To which the only possible response is: GET IT, GIRL!

I am duly impressed by the girls’ determination to become part of the Boy Scouts and their eloquence in support of their cause. I am also very VERY impressed with the girls’ parents, who are standing behind their daughters’ activism even at such a young age.

The Unicorns are fighting a very fundamental and familiar form of injustice: “separate but equal.”

The New York Times quoted a Boy Scout leader who did not like the idea of coed scouting as saying, “Maybe their approach should have been to go to the Girl Scouts and say: Instead of painting our nails and clipping our — whatever they do — to do archery and do climbing. Going through that process.”

But let’s face the facts. Girl Scouts are not just Boy Scouts for girls, and everyone knows it.

Our country’s gender-segregated scouting programs teach girls to sell cookies and sew while the boys learn to build fires and shoot bows and arrows. The Girl Scouts may pay lip service to outdoorsy activities, but when the girls go “camping” it often turns out to be sleeping on the floor and watching movies, microwaving marshmallows for s’mores. Several of the girls in the Unicorns had tried being Girl Scouts, but “found the experience too sedate: rest time and whispering instead of playing tag and lighting fires.”

Unsurprisingly, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts embody the different values America wants to teach girls and boys — boys are strong and independent, while girls are collaborative and domestic. Men are capable providers, while women are caring wives and mothers.

In 2011, Kathleen Denny, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, studied the gender-specific messaging encoded in the Boy Scouts’ and Girl Scouts’ manuals and activities. She found that “scouts are being fed stereotypical ideas about femininity and masculinity.” Says Denny:

“The disproportionate and gendered distribution of art and science projects aligns with the large body of research that finds girls being systematically derailed from scientific and mathematical pursuits and professions due to cultural beliefs and stereotypes about their relative ineptitude in these areas.”

Other key findings from the study:

Girls are more likely than boys to be offered activities involving art projects; girls’ art activities make up 11 percent of their total activities.

Scientifically-oriented activities make up only 2 percent of all girls’ activities, but boys’ science activities take up 6 percent of their scouting time.

Girls are offered proportionately more communal activities than boys; 30 percent of the girls’ badge work activities are intended to take place in groups, either with or for others.

Boys are offered proportionately more self-oriented activities than girls; Less than 20 percent of the boys’ activities are intended to take place with others.

The names of Scout badges also convey strong messages about gender, reinforcing “embellished femininity and stoic masculinity.” The boys’ badges have stoic descriptive titles like “Geologist,” as opposed to the whimsical girls’ version: “Rocks Rock.” The boys’ badges also use more career-oriented language (Engineer, Craftsman, Scientist), while the girls’ badges turn career activities into playful hobbies (“Sky Search” instead of Astronomer and “Car Care” instead of Mechanic).

Separating children by gender always has the result of reinforcing cultural expectations about what boys and girls should do, and by extension, how men and women should be. Boys are learning to be serious about projects and motivated by future career success, while girls get encouragement for being cute, whimsical, and caring.

And the adults defending the segregated status quo are arguing for it in exactly the way you’d expect them to. The New York Times reported that parents of boys in the troop the Unicorns wanted to join “voiced concerns about the prospect of shared tents, the erosion of valuable boys-only time and the possibility that girls — who already outperform boys in many areas — might start to snap up all the leadership positions.”

Shared tents? They’re ten! But according to these parents, it’s never too early for those little Jezebels to start leading their angelic sons into temptation. The erosion of valuable boys-only time? If they believe boys can’t be boys if girls are around, what kind of masculinity are they trying to cultivate?

But worst of all, these parents have openly admitted that they don’t want to let girls into Boy Scouts because they are worried the girls will win competitions and take over the leadership of the troops.

Blithely perpetuating the myth that there is no greater shame for a boy than to be outdone by a girl, they want to safeguard their sons’ right to be better than girls.

How are those boys going to react when they grow up and start competing with women in the work force? We already know this story. They are going to think that they are the victims of a terrible flaw in society if they don’t automatically rise above all the women in their fields. They are going to feel cheated of their God-given right to be the stronger, better sex. And then some of them are going to take out their self-righteous masculine rage in violence against women.

And the girls are also getting the message loud and clear: keep your head down, keep your achievements quiet, keep your ambitions modest, and above all, don’t try to compete with the boys.

If the Unicorns lose this battle, American boys will continue learning to be strong and self-reliant, while girls keep learning the feminine arts of collaboration and domesticity. They will carry the lessons of scouting into adulthood and perpetuate systemic gender inequality.

Gender-segregated scouting has been another failed experiment in the principle of “separate but equal.” Haven’t we learned our lesson by now?",https://medium.com/endless/boy-scouts-and-the-long-overdue-demise-of-separate-but-equal-a339033ac5e0,['Mirah Curzer'],2015-11-24 15:08:39.378000+00:00,"['Feminism', 'Gender Equality', 'Social Justice']"

Rape Culture Is Real No Matter What You Tweet,"Trigger Warning: Rape

On June 16th, Milo Yiannopolous tweeted, “If you’ve heard about a rape, it’s fake.”

@nero/Twitter

This week, just a few months after composing this tweet, Milo Yiannopolous is slated to speak on campus at an event hosted by USC College Republicans.

On a campus where 30% of women and 7% of men have experienced non-consensual sexual contact*, it is imperative that we recognize and validate these experiences. Inviting someone to campus who says rape reports are false does the opposite. On a campus where at least 80% of survivors do not report non-consensual sexual conduct, “if you’ve heard about a rape, it’s fake” is not merely an offensive tweet — it is the very language that makes our campus unsafe. It is a call to doubt survivors. It is a refusal to hold offenders accountable. It is a reminder to survivors that they should be too scared or too ashamed to report their rapists. An endorsement of this rhetoric is simply unacceptable.

Now, USC College Republicans is allowed to invite any guest they find relevant to their community and to their mission. However, every student, regardless of ideology or political party, also has a duty to foster a safe and inclusive culture on campus.

As a feminist and self-proclaimed leftist, I know the College Republicans and we don’t agree on everything. We may not even agree on most things. But this is not about partisan politics. Providing resources for sexual assault survivors is not a liberal agenda and rape prevention shouldn’t be a single party issue.

I am not asking anyone to agree with my personal political views. What I am asking is that every student leader, no matter what organization they represent, carefully consider and recognize the impact of the people they invite to speak. I am asking that every student recognize that words matter — that endorsing Milo Yiannopolous’s words makes our campus less safe.

I sincerely hope that USC College Republicans continues to facilitate important conversations on this campus. After all, a vibrant and thriving democracy depends on conflicting opinions and diverse, intellectual discourse. But I refuse to welcome a person onto this campus who demeans and degrades survivors of sexual assault. I will not stand by silently as my peers’ safety and well-being is put at risk by violent and misogynistic rhetoric.

“I’ll Always Be a Tool & Die Maker”,"By Max Larkin

In advance of our radio show on the future of work in the United States, we (Conor Gillies of WBUR’s Stylus and I) visited Peter Forg Manufacturing, an unusual factory (est. 1881) between Park Street and Rev. Nazareno Properzi Way in Somerville, Mass., about half a mile from Harvard Square. It is, in the words of its receptionist, “an anachronism.”

We went to record a short audio segment to play during our show with the technologist Ray Kurzweil and the economist Andrew McAfee. Here that is:

For three years in and out of college I lived right across a lot from the Forg Mfg. building. I knew it as a metal-stamping factory that opened unpredictably on weekdays, but always early. I quickly forgot how apocalyptically loud it is during hours of operation.

Many of the neighborhood’s old warehouses are now being repurposed as condominiums and businesses that serve the city’s whimsical youth, places where you study “circus arts” and do high-priced indoor rock-climbing. The receptionist (17 years employed there) conceded that the plant could benefit from free advertising on public radio. Everyone who lives on Properzi Way in Somerville knows Peter Forg is there, still rattling China cabinets 130 years after its opening. Set backthe street it looks semi-abandoned, though, awaiting its second life. (Plus, when you see ‘Mfg.’ don’t you think, gone?)

The firm is now run by Dave Forg, who lives in Lexington with his wife and children, and who represents the fifth generation of Forgs to direct the stamping of metal in Somerville. He started there in his early teens, and, but for a brief interlude in business school, he’s received his paychecks from the firm ever since.

Dave began our tour by scrounging around a little to find something — a yellow rake designed to rip down shingles — that comes out of Forg as a recognizable consumer product. (They only make the teeth of the rake.) He employs a little more than a dozen people —mostly men over 55 — and since most of their products is contracted and sold to other manufacturers, they are part of a makers’ economy in America that is largely invisible to the people who buy things.

The internship program at Disney has multiple tiers and the first tier is a gateway: the more valuable job experience lies in the highly selective professional internship. First tier interns hold entry-level jobs and interact with guests. Interns also happen to live together in off-site, fully-furnished apartment complexes similar to dormitories, with transportation provided to and from their work sites.

I applied to the internship program on a whim, and if that didn’t qualify me as Disney material, I don’t know what did. The previous fall, I had transferred to a college closer to home, at a time when I hadn’t really grasped what my goals in college were. The internship presentation was on campus, and I was surprised when the recruiter held interviews that same night. He agreed with me that the internship would make a terrific break between junior and senior year. They made an offer; I accepted. When I saw my interviewer months later at check-in, he didn’t recognize me.

I escaped to Florida for what I viewed as a working vacation. Escape from what? From my own lack of direction, from my father’s failing health, from my fiancé’s very real enlistment in the military. I dove headfirst into a company that is colloquially run by a mouse.

As soon as orientation was over, I began working. I worked the minimum scheduled thirty hours they promised interns, and then I picked up extra shifts for parades and fireworks. I smiled politely when the guests asked cliché boneheaded questions, like “When is the 3:00 parade?” I happily directed guests to the nearest bathroom when greeted with their children’s bare, wet bottoms. I did everything I could not to yell at parents who, heedless of anything but cramming as much fun as possible into a week, shoved their tiny spawn at automated moving vehicles to shave a few seconds off of their wait time.

The smiling was getting to me. After several weeks, I starting having explicit dreams with adult themes, every non-magical thought I suppressed during the day coming out to play at night.

The staff was not entirely populated by interns. Walt Disney World doesn’t share what percentage of its 70,000-strong workforce is provided by the college program, but the program can cause tension among the local cast members. Locals and interns are classed differently at the parks. Locals — and international cast members, including international interns — have the protection of a union. When I had a preferential opening shift for several months, some locals side-eyed me, as if I were getting away with something.

Though they were friendly, it took a while for the locals to warm up to each new group. The college program students rotated out: each internship lasted anywhere from three to six months, or a year if they extended. Some of the locals had been in our work location for years. I imagine it’s hard to work up the energy to get excited about a new group of babyfaces every six months.

This is not to say that the relationship between interns and locals was entirely strained. If I was aimless, I wasn’t the only one. The interns were all a bunch of transplanted college kids. At work, the locals acted as older siblings and surrogate parents. They knew the parks, the managers, local dentists and mechanics and where everyone would hang out after work.

To call them “locals,” even, is misleading. If you spend any time in Florida at all, you will quickly realize how few of its citizens were born there. Our name-tags listed our hometowns and states beneath our names, while interns listed their universities. Very few of those long-term locals’ name-tags listed any of the surrounding Orlando communities, but rather, the places where they had been born.

I shared an apartment with five other women of various ages and nationalities. One roommate was a grandmother from Trinidad and Tobago; her son was on the program also and lived in the building next door. I had roommates from Chicago and Saratoga and China and Argentina, all in a six-month span. Women cycled in and out of our apartment. The Disney College Program is an easy internship to get, but a hard one to finish. The work environment and close living quarters all took a toll, and we drank a lot. Our perks included discounts to the now-defunct Pleasure Island, no-cover nights for cast members at the piano bar, and free entry to the parks.

Free entry to Walt Disney World is possibly the greatest benefit to the internship, in dollar value, at least. On our days off, what did we do? We went and played. As we were all on internship salaries — $6.00 an hour, at the time — going to the parks was all we could afford. If I budgeted carefully, I could afford to eat in the parks when I went. Twice a year, they held tent sales for cast members where they sold drastically reduced merchandise. These tent sales coincided with the busiest times of the year, when a lot of overtime was available. My side of the room was decorated in Disney, and everyone in my family received Disney merchandise for Christmas that year.

I took advantage of my new knowledge of the parks. On play days, my coworkers and neighbors would let me skip the lines on attractions. We coordinated days off and toured the parks together. Occasionally, we even took the time to visit the other local attractions. I visited the Fountain of Youth, relished in its “old Florida” charm, but did not drink of it. The sulfur makes it smell like rotten eggs. We left once in the middle of the night for Clearwater in November, during an unseasonably active hurricane season.

We worked and played in equally hard measure. However, I always felt onstage, and couldn’t seem to turn work off. To this day, if I see someone taking a picture of their family, I will stop and ask if they want to be in the picture too. That habit is a holdover from my Disney days. It drives my husband crazy.

If the interns were all on a six-month long spring break, then the guests committed to squeezing every single dollar of fun out of their holidays. Guests are people you invite into your home, take care of, provide for, and the more time I spent at work, the less hospitable I was. At times, I felt more like a babysitter than a host. I was constantly nudging my guests out of harm’s way: out of the path of a ride or parade vehicle, off of a raised planter, out of a firework fallout zone.

They continued to shell out the thousands of dollars it costs even one person to enjoy a week at the parks. Keeping guests safe was a small measure compared to the monumental task of keeping them happy. Walt Disney World is hot, often crowded, and over-stimulating. It rains everyday at 4 P.M. Everyone is a tourist. No one knows where anything is.

It has to be someone’s job to take care of people, to show them how everything works. I gave them as much magic as I could, whenever possible. As an attractions hostess, the easiest trick in my magic wand was letting people go to the front of line, and I did this as often as possible without inconveniencing my coworkers or other guests. There were a few instances where people didn’t want my help. I never quite knew what to do with those guests.

I was by no means a shining star. In fact, I didn’t even complete my internship. I left with two weeks to spare, to spend that time with my new husband before his first deployment. When I married, it was near the end of my internship. My coworkers pooled together and bought me a card and a wedding pin: Mickey and Minnie kissing in bridal wear, naturally.

“You know the wedding band goes on your finger before your engagement ring,” one work mom said. I didn’t. No one had ever told me. “It’s closest to your heart.”

I turned in my notice several days later, and went back to my new real life.

My former work area has since undergone a complete refurbishment, so I’m curious to take another trip. When I’ve been back in the past, as a guest, the feeling is akin to visiting your old high school: somewhere formative and familiar, but you know you don’t quite belong there anymore. But I’m still thoroughly brainwashed. On one of those past trips, I was standing there, when a woman approached me. “Excuse me,” she asked, “Can you take our picture?”

Tolerance is not acceptance,"Today is the Transgender Day of Remembrance, a day to mourn the lives lost to transphobic violence. With at least 22 trans women, mostly women of color, murdered to date in 2015, our community has a great deal of mourning to do.

This continuing violence is the flip side of visibility in our supposedly progressive times. No trans person, anywhere, is immune. Just this week here in San Francisco, a trans woman was assaulted for a second time. Having moved here from Georgia, she lamented, “I came here to be safe, but we’re really not safe anywhere.”

Many cis people who would never dream of physically attacking a trans person are nonetheless contributing to the violence against us in more subtle ways. Every time someone deliberately misgenders or deadnames a trans person — no matter how famous or problematic that person may be — they are fostering an environment of mistrust and mockery. Every time someone tries to keep us out of restrooms, usually under the guise of protecting (cis) women, they are painting trans people as deviant and dangerous. Every time someone excludes or erases us from participation in online or offline spaces, they are telling the world that we are not worthy of being seen and respected as equals.

Merely tolerating trans people is not enough. We must be respected and treated as fully equal partners in society. That includes non-binary as well as binary trans people. As genderqueer activist Jacob Tobia points out:

The reality is that, even for transgender people who identify as women or as men along the gender binary, when you are mid-transition, you are going to most likely be read as gender non-conforming. So until all gender non-conforming people — whether that’s a place that you’re in temporarily or if that is where you are all the time — are safe, then every trans person is going to encounter discrimination, even if they identify as a trans man or as a trans woman.

Not everyone has the ability to be an activist, but everyone can pay more attention to the cissexist assumptions that fuel transphobic violence.

How Big Money and Big Brother won the British Elections,"The best democracy money can buy

As of the end of last year, the Electoral Commission found that the Tories received the largest amount of donations, at £8,345,687, the bulk of which came from financiers associated with banks, the hedge fund industry, and big business. Two million pounds worth of donations were associated with hedge funds, and a further £4 million with people attending private dinners hosted by senior Tories.

Next up in donations was Labour at £7,163,988, much of which came from trade unions, as well as corporate donors like PricewaterhouseCoopers, a major proponent of corporate tax avoidance; then the Liberal Democrats with £3,038,500, UKIP with £1,505,055, and the Green Party with £248,520.

That was last year. This year, donations continued to come in. In the final week of the campaign, the Tories managed to raise 10 times more donations than Labour — a total of a further £1.36 million — once again largely from hedge fund managers, property tycoons, and a telecoms firm that has avoided paying corporation tax in the UK since 2007.

Political parties appear to have achieved electoral success in direct proportion to the amount of money received to fund their political campaigns, indicating that the most important precondition for victory in Britain’s broken democracy is the party’s subservience to corporate power.

Oligarchy

The role of party donors in determining election outcomes — by determining the effectiveness and reach of national public relations campaigns — has consistently been overlooked by the main parties, despite some obligatory lipservice that has gone nowhere tangible.

Over the last five years, 41% of all individual and corporate donations to British party political-related causes have come from just 76 extremely wealthy people, including City financiers, corporate moguls, and owners of multi-million pound businesses.

Public relations spin has increasingly played a critical function in permitting corporate power to translate its wealth into political power.

In their study of the subject, A Century of Spin (2007), Prof. David Miller and Dr. William Dinan, sociologists and directors of the public interest investigations body, Spinwatch, show how the corporate co-optation of PR has been used to subordinate liberal democracies to corporate rule, and to limit the scope of populist grassroots movements to influence the political party system.

Under a climate of economic uncertainty and lack of independent sources of news and information, public opinion has become evermore vulnerable to slick partisan campaigns that mobilise wealth to create highly effective media spin by which to manipulate voters.

The Tory-UKIP money machine

While UKIP has positioned itself as an independent counterweight to the ‘establishment’ parties, standing up for swathes of under-represented working people, the truth is the opposite.

A large bulk of UKIP’s funding boost came from former Tory donors, millionaire bankers, and corporate executives, pushing the fringe party to receive the third largest percentage of the vote.

But not all these former Tory donors are former Tory donors.

‘Former’ Tory donor Robin Birley, for instance, who owns a Mayfair nightclub and who is one of UKIP’s biggest donors, had also bankrolled the campaign of Tory MP Michael Gove, government chief whip.

Another major former Tory donor, Growth Financial Services, switched to UKIP in 2014, giving the party £90,000 before switching back to fund the re-election campaigns of two prominent Tory MPs, Amber Rudd and Mark Field, who sits on the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee.

Similarly, hedge fund millionaire Crispin Odey donated to UKIP in 2014, but in late March 2015 provided funds to support the re-election of Tory MP and climate denier Jacob Rees-Mogg.

In other words, a number of major Tory donors plugged into the heart of the Conservative Party establishment were funding both UKIP and Tory political opponents.

Days before the elections, Tory-UKIP funder Robin Birley told pro-Tory newspaper The Telegraph that UKIP supporters should strategically vote Conservative in seats that UKIP could not win — which was most of them. In seats that Tories were unlikely to win, he urged Tory supporters to vote UKIP.

This Tory-UKIP switch strategy, he said, would “stop Britain being left with a government being formed by a hard left rabble of parties.”

Ironically, Birley’s recommendations for UKIP supporters to vote tactically for the Tories were vehemently opposed by Nigel Farage, the very leader of the party he had funded.

But the idea of a Tory-UKIP strategic voting bloc had also been endorsed just days before Birley’s announcement by the Bow Group, the oldest conservative think-tank in Britain.

Chaired by Ben Harris-Quinney, who has worked on foreign policy issues for the Conservative Party in the UK and EU parliaments, the Bow Group includes on its board of patrons several senior Tory figures, such as Lord Norman Lamont, Lord Michael Heseltine, Lord Michael Howard, and Lord Earl Howe — who as of 2010 was appointed by David Cameron as Department of Health minister.

MI5 and The Bow Group

The Bow Group’s Conservative Party patrons had all served in senior Cabinet positions, under either Margaret Thatcher or John Major. All four of them made a point of publicly distancing themselves from their chairman’s exhortations to vote UKIP, which were published by The Telegraph.

But also on the board of patrons is renowned philosopher, Prof. Roger Scruton, who has been connected to dubious anti-left intelligence information operations. Unlike his colleagues in the Tory party, Scruton was silent throughout this affair.

In the 1980s, Scruton was a member of the neoconservative Hillgate Group, a network of British academics who coordinated various policy publications to influence government. Their focus was hyping up the threat of Marxist, leftwing or “radical” infiltration of British universities and schools. Scruton admitted to historian David Callaghan, however, that the Group’s policy reports were “quietly encouraged by 10 Downing Street to concoct an outside pressure group to influence policy.”

Scruton’s Hillgate Group was run by Baroness Caroline Cox, another senior Conservative Party figure with a history of political agitation on behalf of British intelligence. In 1977, Cox was part of a study group behind a report on how leftwing “radical minorities” were subverting “capitalist, free market civilisation.” The report was published by the Institute for the Study of Conflict (ISC), a “think tank” created jointly by the British and American intelligence services, specifically the CIA, an MI5-MI6 linked intelligence unit in the Cabinet Office, and the Foreign Office.

The Bow Group’s role in promoting the Tory-UKIP voting strategy was therefore not a curious aberration. Rather, it reflected a strategy being explored by senior elements in the Tory establishment and its elite support-base in the corporate oligarchy.

Scruton’s role in the Bow Group further raises questions about the role of Downing Street and Britain’s intelligence services in the use of UKIP to ramp up pro-Tory votes.

Roger Scruton could not be reached for comment.

MI5 and UKIP

Unbeknown to many, UKIP too had early roots in Britain’s intelligence services.

In 2001, former Conservative Party chairman Norman Tebbit called for an independent inquiry into revelations that UKIP had been infiltrated by MI5. In a televised interview on BBC News, Tebbit said:

“A chap came to me and said UKIP had been infiltrated by the British intelligence services and then he gave me two names of people and from various ways I came to the conclusion that I was absolutely and completely certain that these people — although they had left the service and the Foreign Office some years earlier — in fact had been intelligence agents.”

As Tebbit explained in a Spectator article that even Douglas Murray recently endorsed, he “half-heartedly” made his “own inquiries” after a source inside UKIP raised the concerns with him, “and unexpectedly struck gold… I am perfectly sure that the individuals had been active agents, although both would claim to have retired some years ago.”

Tebbit had not suggested that UKIP’s leadership was aware of the intelligence operation. At the time, Nigel Farage admitted that he could not discount Tebbit’s allegations.

It eventually turned out that the two people identified by Tebbit — Heather Conyngham and Christopher Skeate — had indeed been former MI6 officers, who had worked together at one time in Latin America. They were also both senior figures in the now defunct Referendum Party, Skeate as a candidate in 1997.

Robin Birley, the major Tory-UKIP donor who had urged a Tory-UKIP mutual tactical voting strategy, was at that time operations director of the Referendum Party, a Eurosceptic party similar to UKIP. Both Conyngham and Skeate had transferred their allegiance to UKIP after the death of Referendum Party founder, Sir James Goldsmith (Birley’s stepfather).

Birley and his Referendum Party also had a wider relationship to Latin America, specifically Chile. In 1998, Birley had recruited Referendum’s communications director, Patrick Robertson, to work with his campaign group, ‘Chilean Supporters Abroad,’ in support of notorious dictator Chilean General Pinochet, who had been supported by Margaret Thatcher herself.

The late Pinochet had been installed in a brutal military coup in 1973, which had been planned and backed by the CIA and MI6 since the democratic elections that brought leftwing nationalist President Salvador Allende to power in 1970. Birley’s ‘Chilean Supporters Abroad’ published a pro-Pinochet pamphlet that promulgated a range of MI6 and CIA disinformation about Allende.

Senior Tory pro-Pinochet apologists Norman Lamont and Michael Howard are today senior patrons of the Bow Group.

It later transpired that Tebbit’s original informant was then UKIP press officer Chris Jones, who months earlier had written a formal letter to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Tribunal about his “allegation, based on detailed circumstantional [sic] evidence gathered over 5 months that UKIP has been penetrated and is largely controlled by British Intelligence agents.”

The letter requested that the Tribunal:

“… call upon files on UKIP: myself: Dr R AE North: G Franklyn-Ryan: Nigel Farage MEP: Heather Coyningham a former FCO official; Christopher Skeate also FCO: Tony Stone: Mark Daniel (alias): Janet Girsman and G Lance Watkins.”

The curious overlap of MI5-MI6 officers with the Referendum, UKIP and Tory parties, and the movement of donors between all three parties, raises questions about the manipulation of the popular vote by a nexus of powerful British interests encompassing a network of corporate elites and Whitehall officials.

MI5 and SNP

The Tory-UKIP nexus is not the only instance offering disturbing evidence of the interference of British intelligence in our national elections.

Last month, The Telegraph — which had also promoted the Tory-UKIP strategy put out by the Bow Group and Robin Birley — published an ‘exclusive’ about a leaked FCO memo, which purportedly recorded Scottish National Party (SNP) leader Nicola Sturgeon telling the French Ambassador she would prefer a Tory government.

But as former UK Ambassador to Uzbekistan and longtime Foreign Office (FCO) official, Craig Murray, remarked about the alleged memo, “both sides of the alleged conversation categorically deny it was said. Nicola Sturgeon denies she said it and the French Embassy deny she said it.”

Supposedly, the confidential contents of Sturgeon’s meeting with the French Ambassador had been passed to the Foreign Office and transcribed by a Whitehall official as a matter of FCO protocol.

“The extraordinary thing is, this is just a lie,” said Murray.

“As someone who worked in the FCO for over twenty years and was an Ambassador myself, I can assure you there is absolutely no protocol requirement on the French Ambassador to give the FCO the content of the meetings she, her Consul-General or anybody else from the French Embassy held in Edinburgh. That claim is absolute nonsense.”

Even more bizarrely, it turned out that the Foreign Office itself denied being the source of the alleged ‘leaked memo.’

Drawing on the example of the MI6-forged Zinoviev letter ‘leaked’ to the Daily Mail in 1924, which triggered the fall of the Labour government, Murray concluded: “The fake FCO memo has MI5 written all over it. This is the worst example of British security services influencing an election campaign since the Zinoviev letter.”

“I have been warning the SNP that we are going to be the target of active subversion by the UK and US security services. We are seen as a danger to the British state and thus a legitimate target,” the former Ambassador added.

“That the attempt to destabilise Nicola Sturgeon originates with the UK government and the Telegraph should give everyone pause. It is very obviously a security service effort. How otherwise is an account which the French Embassy says is completely false, contained in an official memo to be leaked? This episode raises very serious questions. But they are not questions about Nicola Sturgeon. They are questions about the subversion of democracy by the security services, and the willing complicity of the corporate media.”

There is thus alarming evidence that not just Big Money, but Big Brother, made a concerted effort to disrupt the SNP and co-opt UKIP, as a mechanism to sideline what Birnley characterised as a “hard left rabble of parties,” cementing a Tory parliamentary majority.

The next five years promises more of what we have already seen over the last five years: austerity, corporate empowerment, privatisation of public services widening inequality, continued obfuscation on climate change, subservience to Big Oil and nuclear lobbies, and a return of the snoopers’ charter — previously blocked by the Lib Dems — that would enshrine excessively intrusive surveillance powers into law.

So we should make no mistake. This is not a victory for British democracy.

Businessmen,"Perpetually the eavesdropper, I overheard a conversation recently that caused me to lean from my chair at such an angle that I almost fell into an embarrassing heap on the floor. The conversation itself was not shocking in context; however I still found it all to be a bit alarming. It went something like this:

(Disclaimer: Their names are what I imagined they should be, based on attire, grooming, and the general aura which I judgmentally attached based on my snooping.)

William: I have so much to do when I get home. You wouldn’t believe it. There’s no way I can have it done by tomorrow. I shouldn’t even be here now. I should be at home working.

Frank: I’ll bet I can trump you. I’ve got my regular load and a huge project due by the end of the week. It’s impossible.

Sal: I don’t even understand what I’m working on. I’m going to have to get some extra help or something. It just doesn’t make any sense to me at all, and she expects me to have it done by Monday. Monday! She’ll be lucky if I can get it done by the end of the month.

Stuart: I hear you. I’ve got a lot going on, too. Stupid, busy-work but it has to get done. I need a break though. Anyone want to hang out after this? Maybe walk over to the park? I’ve got to get some energy out.

William: I wish I could, but I’ve got to be in bed early tonight. There’s no way I can get all of this work done unless I head straight home.

Stu: Did you see Emma today? Just burst into tears and ran out crying. The workload got to her. She cracked under the pressure.

Stuart: I can’t even think anymore; I so badly need a break. Sitting in a chair for six hours a day is making me crazy. I’m about to start crying and run out myself, because at least then I won’t be stuck in that stupid chair anymore!

Frank: Oh man, I hear you. I thought it was just me. Sometimes I’m just sitting there, totally zoned out. When I heard Emma crying I realized that I hadn’t done any work in an hour!

Sal: Try sitting there when you have no idea what you’re doing. It makes the day go even slower. I think I’m going to have to just give it up soon. I’m a failure at this. There has to be a better way.

Stuart: You’re not a failure, Sal. It’s a tough job. You can do it. Don’t worry about it so much. C’mon. Let’s just take a break. It will make everything easier.

Amidst grumbles of protest, Stuart, Sal, Frank, and William dismounted from their chairs, sliding forward from their seats until their feet, which were dangling above the ground, hit the floor. Their mothers stood up also, addressing the ketchup on the boys’ faces with wet napkins, and tucking their shirts back in. The children chased each other briefly around the chairs, squeezing in an impromptu game of tag while their mothers paid the bill. They were rapidly rounded up and chastised, then walked together out of the restaurant, down the sidewalk in the opposite direction of the park.

I watched as Stuart grabbed his mother’s hand, trying to drag her the other way, but she shook her head “no”, pulling his arm sharply. He threw himself to the ground in a protest of tears. I watched her sigh as she picked him up and carried him away from the window, patting his back while he sobbed, his arm still pointing at the park, where his childhood lay, abandoned.",https://medium.com/synapse/businessmen-b32ea44d0cc,['Laura Eberhart Goodman'],2015-11-17 12:58:48.765000+00:00,"['Short Story', 'Fiction', 'Education']"
How to change the world in 3 easy steps,"These seemingly disparate crises are not happening separately and accidentally. They are interrelated symptoms of our global civilisational paradigm, premised on fossil fuel-driven unlimited growth on a finite planet, through geopolitical alliances with autocratic, terror-toting — but oil-rich — regimes in the Muslim world.

The acceleration of global crises, therefore, is not so much about the end of the world, as it’s about ‘the end of the world as we know it’: our global civilisational paradigm is increasingly hitting the limits of planetary boundaries. It’s not working anymore.

And by the end of this century, if the scientific consensus is remotely accurate, this paradigm will not be capable of surviving.

We are, therefore, in the midst of a momentous civilisational transition, the outcomes of which are not set in stone. In this context, the chronically bad news we see everyday is not just bad news: it also signals the inevitable decline of a particular way of being in the world. But this also opens up, here and now, opportunities to forge what comes after.

Within the very accelerating failure of the present paradigm, the opportunity to explore and build new paradigms that work also accelerates.

Just examine this Transition Network showcase of 21 grassroots initiatives from around the world, put together in the lead-up to the Paris climate talks. They include powerful, real-world projects that are changing the lives of people on the ground right now, encompassing:

local, sustainable food production; local currencies that revitalise local economies; the emergence of localised sharing economies; harvesting and storing rainwater amidst drought; the rise of egalitarian workers cooperatives; a shift to clean forms of transport in rural communities; entrepreneurship for people, not to centralise profits for a few; community-owned renewable energy enterprises that benefit local economies.

That’s just a sample. Rob Hopkins of the Transition Network explains the vision behind these initiatives:

“Something brilliant and historic is already underway, and our message to the Obamas, Camerons and Merkels of this world is that it’s already happening without them, and they need to support and enable it, but even if they do nothing, it will continue to grow, because it’s the future.”

So what can we do? What can you, as one person do?

Here’s, roughly, what I tell people when they ask me this, based on my own limited experience and efforts.

Step 1: Start with you

When you realise something’s wrong with the world, the first step has to focus on educating yourself about it. Then, when you begin to have a grasp on the issue, and you want to step up and do something about it, it’s important to be pragmatic and realistic.

Rather than wanting to change the world and constantly feeling frustration because, well, that’s basically impossible, you need to start with what’s closest to home, what’s realistically attainable and achievable within your own context.

That means, constantly seeking to improve your knowledge and understanding of the issues you’re most interested in, and their wider systemic context; while simultaneously assessing what you think you have to offer.

But that must also involve assessing how you yourself are part of the problem you’re looking at.

Don’t just be material about it — it’s not just about facts and figures and lifestyle choices. It’s also about who you are; the way you deal with people in your family, community and society; your attitude to life and others; and the scope for change within the constraints of your circumstances.

Sometimes we have to accept what we can’t change and focus on what we can. More than anything, that means focusing on you. That means getting to the core of the prevailing paradigm, and altering who you are so that you’re capable of being, in your everyday life, to the extent that is attainable for you, someone who stands for the sort of change you want to see in the world.

No one else can tell you what this is. They might be able to help you think about it. But ultimately, it has to come from you.

Step 2: Continue with those around you

Having assessed yourself, and begun the process of creating yourself anew as someone who can think and be in some way beyond the prevailing paradigm, it’s time to look around you in the context of your interests and skills.

What do you enjoy? What are you good at? And what does that tell you about what you have to offer in terms of working to plant seeds of a new, better world? Are there people around you who you can work with to plant those seeds, with respect to your and their interests and skills?

If not, find them. Make a point of doing so, whether its by reaching out in the real-world through organisations or institutions or events or meeting places, or through social media.

If so, reach out and start building a network where you can collaborate or communicate as a member of a community, sharing your interests and skills: even if it’s just you and one other person, that’s a start.

Step 3: Create something new

Artwork by Lilli Emmer

Based on your newfound insight into yourself and people you can connect with around you, along with your shared interests and skills, think about what you collectively have to offer and how that can meet a need or a gap.

What does your community need? What does it lack? What do you think you could do to address this?

It doesn’t need to be a massive project. On the contrary, it needs to be eminently doable. Which means, it has to be scaled according to your capacities. There’s no point reaching to achieve something which is not within your capacities — unless you incorporate an eminently doable plan to build and expand your capacities.

So, once again, be pragmatic and realistic, and then create something fundamentally new.

The most important criterion of what you create has to be that it breaks with the old paradigm in some way, and thus contributes to the creation of a new paradigm.

This is critical. Don’t create something that’s too easy, too attainable, to the point that all it really does is chime nicely within the existing framework of doing things. Instead, create something new that consciously and physically breaks with the old, and establishes a new pattern of activity or being that contributes to a new paradigm.

It could be as simple as setting up and running a regular, local community workshop with friends to educate yourselves about global crises and solutions.

Or it could be more ambitious. But it needs to involve actually, physically creating a new pattern of being in yourself and others. Whether it operates primarily in the digital or real world, it has to have meaningful impact in the actual physical world, even if that’s just about fundamentally altering your personal routine in a paradigm-breaking way.

Don’t worry if the seeds you plant don’t bear fruit immediately in terms of monumental change.

The fact is, as individuals, neither of us has the power to change the entire world. And that’s okay. We need to accept that, and focus on what we can change, rather than obsessing over what we can’t, which is precisely an egoistic symptom of the prevailing paradigm.

So there you have it, three easy steps to changing the world:

One — Start with you Two — Continue with those around you Three — Create something new

Then, as an integral part of creating something new: encourage each of those around you, working with you, to adopt and pass on the message of these three simple steps.

Imagine a world where each of us did this.

Imagine the scale of spontaneous, grassroots transformation that could result.

Well, guess what. The process has already started by you reading this — and is already well underway thanks to millions of Free Spirits around the world. And the best way to catalyse this process is to act on these steps, and encourage others to do the same, and spread the word.

By adopting these steps to try and embody, personify and practice the change we want to see in the world, we begin planting the seeds of a post-materialist, post-capitalist paradigm, that can emerge as the present paradigm inevitably fails by this century’s end.

We can change the world, but the key to doing so is in you and me.

Big O Analysis and the Top Talent Fallacy,"Big O Analysis and the Top Talent Fallacy

How basic analysis can trump over-engineering

A long time ago when I was a junior engineer I worked at a place that claimed to hire top talent. You know the place. Almost everyone had gone to MIT, Carnegie Mellon or had some intimidating subset of the alphabet come after their name. It seemed requisite to get in. I learned a lot while I worked there, but not always what I expected to.

The algorithm I worked on involved a fair amount of statistical analysis. At the heart of one of our data analysis modules was an algorithm that needed to build up a sorted linked list of items. This portion of the algorithm went something like this pseudocode:

val items:List[Node] = List() while(itemGenerator.hasMoreItems()) {

val item = itemGenerator.nextItem()

val head = list.head while(head < item) {

head = head.nextNode

} head.nextNode = Node(item, head.nextNode)

}

Quite simply loop through the list until you found the correct place to insert the new value and just do the insert. The algorithm would then analyze this list to give its final output.

The overall algorithm was slow. It took almost half a day to run on only a few hundred thousand data points. This was including distributing the workload to four nodes and doing a map/reduce operation. Much to my surprise, this was just an accepted fact of the nature of “large and complicated” data. Not only that but the top engineers were advocating some seriously heavy solutions to speed up the algorithm. Think data compression algorithms, Approximation algorithms and the ilk. I brought it up in one of our retrospectives that this particular part of the algorithm was an O(n^2) algorithm that was probably a big bottleneck.

Much to my surprise, according to the engineers, I was wrong. This clearly was not an O(n^2) algorithm because we start with an empty list, and we probably don’t always do the worst case of adding a new element to the end of the list on every iteration.

Ok, so maybe I was wrong. I figured as a learning experience it was easy to take a stab at seeing where I had went wrong. So I set out to see where the proof would fail.

This problem can be expressed as looping over a list, doing an O(1) compare for each element and then an O(1) insert at the end. Doing this once is clearly an O(n) algorithm and doing this N times is seemingly O(n^2). But our list starts out very small and grows with each pass of the algorithm. How can we account for that while using big O?

Well let’s just think of how many comparisons we need to do to insert an element while maintaining sorted order in the worst case. Worst case we’ll need to examine every element. At first, we simply insert the first element into an empty list. Then we do one comparison with the first element. Then the number of comparisons grows for each element we add to the list. How can we express this mathematically in a form we can analyze?

We just have a simple arithmetic sequence at this point. This can be expressed fairly simply with summation:

This still doesn’t give us something useful to do big O analysis on. But oftentimes in mathematics, its just a matter of perspective. Let’s rewrite the above in reverse order and compare it to what we originally wrote:

Now something interesting becomes apparent. What if we were to add the first two terms of each summation to each other? And then the next two? In the first case we have n+1, for the second term we have 2+(n-1) which just so happens to equal n+1. It turns out of we just add each term of the two sums, we wind up with (n+1) for each term. Thus we wind up with:

Now what happens when we do the same thing over and over n times? Easy, that’s just multiplication:

Now we can just divide by two to get a succinct formula for 1+2+3+…+n:

Now let’s be generous and assume the average case where we only have to insert halfway into the list. We’ll divide by two and do the big O on the resulting value:

So I wasn’t wrong. We arrive at this algorithm being O(n^2) quite easily with some very simple algebra. When I took the linked list out and replaced it with a more appropriate data structure, the program sped up almost 100 percent.

Once this was presented to the other engineers, of course the algorithm was changed right away. Later on I was able to chip away at other similar inefficiencies leading to a drastic speedup, again, without any crazy algorithms. Just old fashioned bottleneck analysis.

It turns out the algorithm was pretty fast to begin with. It was just poorly executed by the same top talent who thought further algorithmic complexity was the solution instead of basic analysis.

Lessons learned

Despite there being some very smart people on the team, as evidenced by their degrees and titles, the extreme over-engineering and lack of execution was astounding. Moreover the willingness to brush aside someone’s valid concerns without any real thought into the problem at hand was also disconcerting. Sadly, I feel like this is a general problem in the tech industry, one I’ve had to deal with and one I’ve seen others have to deal with.

I think being humble is a key to being truly successful at the level of a leader. Its always important to realize that no matter how smart or talented you are, you’re going to miss things. You’re going to get things wrong. Sometimes very wrong. That should be perfectly ok. Having other people there, regardless of their experience level or depth of knowledge who can catch your mistakes makes you stronger as an individual and as a leader. Not only that but it makes the person who saw your errors that much stronger and wiser as well. Even if you wind up being right, it can be an extremely valuable lesson for both parties.

I think a lot of people in that position and level tend to get an opinion of infallibility about themselves. Its easy to get overly cocky about your abilities. Especially if your opinion is validated because you’re “top talent”.

Top talent is a lie that managers tell themselves to sleep better at night. Mathematically, you can’t hire “top talent” consistently by virtue of it being an extremely small subset of the population. Furthermore, what qualifies one as “top talent” is an inherently immeasurable metric and can vary from person to person. If you apply arbitrary metrics for what “top talent” means — prestigious degree — PhD — you’re potentially setting up yourself for disappointment. Instead focus on metrics that really matter — positive results.",https://medium.com/coding-with-clarity/big-o-analysis-and-the-top-talent-fallacy-4b1d841f47f,['Matt Fowler'],2015-12-04 02:07:52.323000+00:00,"['Algorithms', 'Mathematics', 'Programming']"
Is Disney Still an Affordable Vacation?,"I’ve been to Disneyland three times in my life, and Walt Disney World once.

The first time I went to Disneyland, I was too young to appreciate or remember any of it, except for the part where my parents rented a stroller for my little sister, parked it outside of a ride, and couldn’t find it afterwards. (The domestic is always more compelling than the spectacular.)

The second time, I was maybe nine years old, and I remember my parents were pretty firm about the rules: my sister and I were each given a small amount of money for a souvenir, and that was ours to spend — and it also meant that we were not allowed to spend the day asking our parents to buy us everything we saw. We had our own money, and that was it. (I also feel like we were both given a set of mouse ears, although I don’t remember if that was this trip or the earlier one.)

My sister and I each ended up buying pins, and in one of my less-impressive moves as a sibling, I deliberately neglected to tell my little sister that she was standing one rack over from the good pins; that is, she was looking at a bunch of Mickey and Minnie pins, and I was looking at all the princesses. I remember wanting something that my sister did not also have, and so I kept my mouth shut — and felt awful about it as soon as we were standing in line to hand over our money.

When I was in high school, my family went to Walt Disney World, and by then my sister and I had allowances and jobs, so, again, there was no expectation that we would walk into a store and beg our parents to buy us something.

I can’t remember if I bought anything on that trip; at that point in time, every dollar I had went towards music and clothes, because I was in high school. (That’s me in the picture, by the way, rocking a bucket hat and Sailor Moon tank top. I didn’t say my fashion choices were good.)

And two years ago, I went to Disneyland on a discounted ticket as part of VidCon’s Disney Day. I didn’t buy any souvenirs on that trip either, but I did pay for a wine flight in California Adventure, because I have my priorities. (It was very good wine.)

I’ve always thought of Disneys Land and World as places that were designed to hit nearly any price point; if you have enough money to get in the park, you can have a great time without spending anything extra. Disney even lets you bring snacks into the park, so you could in theory get by without purchasing any food.

Well, now things might be changing. To quote the Washington Post:

For America’s middle-income vacationers, the Mickey Mouse club, long promoted as “made for you and me,” seems increasingly made for someone else. But far from easing back, the theme-park giant’s prices are expected to climb even more through a surge-pricing system that could value a summer’s day of rides and lines at $125.

The surge-pricing system has not yet gone into effect, although it’s being discussed as if it were an inevitability. Right now, the base price for one day at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World is $105, which, to my jaded eyes, seems reasonable; I mean, I just paid $45.25 to go to a concert, so why not pay $105 to spend a full day at Disney? It’s less than the cost of a decent pair of shoes, or a fancy meal, or an average pair of jeans.

Of course, it isn’t just $105 unless you’re a single person who absorbs food via photosynthesis. If you’re going with a family, it’s $105 per person ($99 for kids between ages 3–9), and you probably have transportation, lodging, and meal costs on top of that. A Disney vacation could easily hit $1,000 before you even arrive at the park.

To understand how these costs have skyrocketed, the Washington Post includes a chart to remind us that in the 1980s, a Magic Kingdom ticket was roughly $20. They also list some of the more popular Disney extras, such as the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutiques that “sell a $195 pampering for little girls that includes a makeover, hair-styling, a costume and a princess sash.” If you are taking your family on a once-in-a-lifetime Disney vacation, are you going to get the $195 makeover? Are you going to allow your children to dine with the Disney Princesses at Cinderella’s Royal Table (where Disney helpfully suggests that you should plan to spend $60 per adult)?

Would I have been a child who begged my parents to let me have breakfast with the princesses, and was disappointed when they said no? It feels like that’s the real game-changer here; it’s not that Disney at its base level is unaffordable to the middle class — although I am well aware that $400 for a family of four is right on the edge of “affordable” — it’s that there’s so much extra stuff that you feel like you’re missing out.

You feel like a have-not in the middle of the Happiest Place On Earth. That’s what the Washington Post means when it writes that Disney is no longer for the middle class.

But what do you think? Do you think Disney is an affordable vacation, for your definition of affordable? And would you be happy to just go and enjoy the rides and parades, without paying for any of the extras?

Ask Ethan #97: Can Moons Have Moons?,"“What was scattered, gathers.

What was gathered, blows away.” -Heraclitus

When you think of our Solar System, you think of planets (and other object) orbiting our central star, with moons (or other satellites) orbiting those giant, rocky or icy worlds. But could there be more levels than that? Could we have satellites stably orbiting moons, and if so, where are they? While many of you sent in your questions and suggestions this week, the honor goes to our Patreon supporter kilobug, who asks:

[I]n the solar system, AFAIK, there is no single “moon of a moon”, something like an asteroid orbiting the moon of a planet. Is there a reason for that (like such an orbit being unstable)? Or is it just unlikely to occur?

Think about what happens if you’ve got just a single mass, spinning in space.

Everything is simple, here. You’ve got this object’s gravitational field, caused primarily by its mass. It curves the space around it, causing everything in its vicinity to be attracted to it. If gravitation were the only thing at work, here, you’d be able to place any object into a stable, elliptical-or-circular orbit around it, and it would continue on that way forever.

But there are other factors at play, including the fact that:

this object can have some sort of atmosphere, or a diffuse “halo” of particles around it,

this object isn’t necessarily stationary, but can spin — perhaps rapidly — about an axis,

and that this object isn’t necessarily as isolated as you initially imagined.

Image credit: NASA / JPL-Caltech / Cassini.

The first factor, an atmosphere, only matters in the most extreme of cases. Normally, an object orbiting a massive, solid world with no atmosphere would simply need to avoid the object’s surface, and it could remain revolving around it forever.

But if you throw in the presence of an atmosphere, even an incredibly diffuse one, any orbiting bodies will have to contend with those atoms and particles surrounding the central mass. Even though we normally think of our atmosphere as having an “end” and space beginning beyond a certain altitude, the reality is that atmospheres simply thin out as you go to higher and higher elevations. Earth’s atmosphere continues for many hundreds of kilometers; even the international space station will someday decay and meet a fiery doom unless we continually boost it.

Over Solar System timescales of billions of years, the point is that orbiting bodies need to be a certain distance away from whatever mass they orbit in order to be “safe.”

An object can spin. This applies to both the large mass and the smaller one orbiting it. There’s a “stable” point, where both masses are tidally locked to one another (where both of them always have the same side pointing to one another), but if you have any other configuration, there will be some “torquing” happening. This torque can work to either spiral the two masses inwards (if the rotation is too slow) or outwards (if the rotation is too fast) for the locking to occur. In other words, most satellites don’t start off in the ideal configuration!

But there’s one more factor that we need to throw in to get to the issue of “moons of moons” and really see where the difficulty lies.

Image credit: Wikimedia Commons user Stephanie Hoover.

The fact that an object isn’t isolated is a really big deal. It’s a lot easier to keep an object in orbit around a single mass — like a moon around a planet, a small asteroid around a large one, or Charon around Pluto — than it is to keep an object in orbit around a mass that itself orbits another mass. This is a huge factor, and isn’t one we normally consider. But think about it for a moment from the perspective of our innermost, moonless planet, Mercury.

Image credit: Chris Go, via http://spaceweather.com/mercury/.

Mercury orbits our Sun relatively quickly, and hence both the gravitational and tidal forces on it are very large. If there were something else orbiting Mercury, there would now be a large number of additional factors at play:

The “wind” from the Sun (the flow of outward particles) would crash into both Mercury and the object orbiting it, perturbing the orbits. The heat that the Sun applies to Mercury’s surface can result in an extension of Mercury’s atmosphere. Even though Mercury is airless, particles on the surface get heated and thrown into space, creating a tenuous but non-negligible atmosphere. And finally, there’s a third mass in there that wants to cause the ultimate tidal lock: to have not only that small mass and Mercury locked to one another, but to have Mercury locked to the Sun.

This means that, for any satellite of Mercury, there are two limiting locations.

Image credit: NASA, via http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/observatory_l2.html.

If the satellite is too close to Mercury in any number of ways:

the satellite is not rotating fast enough for its distance,

Mercury isn’t rotating fast enough to achieve tidal lock with the Sun,

susceptible to slowdown from the solar wind,

or subject to sufficient friction from the Mercurian atmosphere,

it will eventually crash into Mercury’s surface.

Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech.

And on the flipside, it risks being ejected from Mercury’s orbit by being pushed away if the satellite is too distant and other considerations apply:

the satellite rotates too quickly for its distance,

Mercury rotates too quickly to become locked with the Sun,

the solar wind imparts additional speed to the satellite,

the perturbative effects of other planets work to eject a tenuously held moon or satellite,

or heating from the Sun imparts additional kinetic energy to a sufficiently small satellite.

Now, with all that said, there are planets out there with moons! While a three-body system is never truly stable unless you’re in that perfect configuration alluded to earlier, we can achieve stability on timescales of billions of years under the right circumstances, which is all we care about for kilobug’s question. There are a few conditions that make it easier:

Have the planet/asteroid that’s the main mass of the system be sufficiently far away from the Sun so that the solar wind, the flux of sunlight and the Sun’s tidal forces are all small. Have the satellite of that planet/asteroid be close enough to the main body so that it isn’t too loosely bound, gravitationally, so that it’s unlikely to be kicked out from other gravitational or mechanical interactions. Have the satellite of that planet/asteroid be far enough from the main body so that tidal, frictional or other effects won’t cause it to inspiral and merge with the parent body.

Image credit: Frank Hettick / Fine Art America, via http://fineartamerica.com/featured/jupiter-and-its-moon-lo-as-seen-frank-hettick.html.

As you may have guessed, there’s a “sweet spot” for moon to exist around planets: a few times farther away than the planet’s radius, but close enough in that the orbital period isn’t too long: still significantly shorter than the planet’s orbital period around its star.

So with all of this in mind, where are the satellites of moons in our solar system?

Image credit: Mdf at English Wikipedia.

The closest thing we have is that we have trojan asteroids with satellites of their own, but since none of these are “moons” of Jupiter, that doesn’t quite fit the bill. What then?

The short answer is, we’re unlikely to see one at all, but there is hope. The gas giant worlds are pretty stable, and pretty far away from the Sun. They have plenty of moons, many of which are already tidally locked to their parent world. The largest moons are the best candidates we have for housing satellites. The best candidates would be:

as massive as possible,

relatively far away from the parent body to minimize the inspiral risk,

not so far away that there’s a chance of an easy ejection,

and — this is a new one — well-separated from any other moons, rings, or satellites that could perturb your system.

With all of that said, what are the best candidates for moons in our Solar System that might have stable moons of their own?

Jupiter’s moon Callisto: the outermost of all Jupiter’s major satellites at 1,883,000 km, Callisto is also large with a radius of 2,410 km. It takes relatively long to orbit Jupiter at 16.7 days, and has a sizable escape velocity of 2.44 km/s.

Jupiter’s moon Ganymede: the biggest moon in the solar system (2,634 km in radius), Ganymede is far from Jupiter (1,070,000 km), but possibly not far enough. (It’s only another 50% of the distance outer to Europa’s orbit.) It has the highest escape velocity of any of the Solar System’s moons (at 2.74 km/s), but the highly populated jovian system makes it less than likely that any of Jupiter’s satellites have moons.

Saturn’s moon Iapetus: it’s not that big (734 km in radius), but Iapetus is far from Saturn at a mean orbital distance of 3,561,000 km from our ringed planet. It’s well outside of Saturn’s rings and well-separated from all the other major moons. The downside is its low mass and size: you only need to travel at 573 meters-per-second to escape Iapetus’ surface.

Uranus’ moon Titania: at 788 km in radius, it’s Uranus’ largest moon, located some 436,000 km from Uranus and taking 8.7 days to orbit.

Uranus’ moon Oberon: Uranus’ second largest (761 km) but most distant (584,000 km) large moon, it takes 13.5 days to orbit Uranus. Oberon and Titania, however, are dangerously (and possibly prohibitively) close to one another to allow for a “moon-of-a-moon” to happen around Uranus.

Neptune’s moon Triton: this captured Kuiper Belt Object is huge (1,355 km in radius), distant from Neptune (355,000 km) and massive; an object needs to travel at over 1.4 km/s to escape Triton’s gravity. This would, perhaps, be my best “bet” for a moon of a planet that had its own natural satellite.

Image credit: Voyager 2, NASA, JPL.

But with all of that said, I wouldn’t expect any. The conditions to acquire and retain a moon-of-a-moon all pose extreme difficulties when you consider how many gravitationally perturbative objects are in these gas giant systems. If I had to place bets, I’d say Iapetus and Triton were the most likely candidates for having a “moon-of-a-moon,” since they’re the farthest main satellites of their world, they’re somewhat isolated from other large masses, and the escape velocity from the surface of each of those worlds is still fairly substantial.

But with all that said, to the best of our knowledge, we still don’t know of any. Perhaps this reasoning is all wrong, as well, and our best bet will actually be in the far reaches of the Kuiper Belt or even the Oort Cloud, where we simply have so many more chances than we’d ever get in our Solar System.

Image credit: Robert Hurt (IPAC), via http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=KBOs.

To the best of our knowledge, these objects could exist: it’s possible, but it requires very specific conditions that would take a fair bit of serendipity. As far as our observations go, that serendipity didn’t occur in our Solar System. But you never know: the Universe is full of surprises. And the better our capabilities to look become, the more we tend to find. I wouldn’t be too surprised if the next great mission to Jupiter (or other gas giants) uncovered this exact phenomenon!

"Death, drugs, and HSBC","Following revelations that the Swiss banking arm of HSBC — the world’s second largest bank — was engaged in massive fraudulent tax-evasion relating to assets totaling $100 billion, Peter Oborne dropped an unexpected bombshell.

The veteran journalist exposed how one of Britain’s leading national broadsheets, The Telegraph, refused to cover the HSBC scandal to protect its corporate advertising revenues. The increasing encroachment of corporate power on The Telegraph’s editorial decisions was among the factors, Oborne said, that led him to resign from his position as chief political commentator at the paper.

But the latest HSBC scandal, and The Telegraph’s belatedly selective reporting of it, barely scratch the surface of the enormous power wielded by Britain’s biggest bank at the expense of the British public.

The scale of tax-evasion in the HSBC Swiss leaks case amounts to hundreds of millions of pounds.

Another far worse case of HSBC fraud totalling an estimated £1 billion, closer to home and premised on the bank’s ability to prey on unsuspecting British shoppers, has been systematically covered up by regulators, police, law firms, the government and much of the UK media.

Fraud

According to whistleblower Nicholas Wilson, HSBC has been integrally involved in a fraudulent scheme to illegally overcharge British shoppers in arrears for debt on store cards at leading British high-street retailers. Without knowing, hundreds of thousands of Britons have been defrauded of a total of one billion pounds worth of money, reveals Wilson, a former debt recovery specialist who uncovered the crimes.

Nicholas Wilson, former head of debt recovery at Weightmans solicitors, and whistleblower on HSBC fraud

And that’s just the quantity of illegal profiteering through debt recovery uncovered by one whistleblower at one bank.

In 2003, HSBC bought HFC Bank, which had been charged by US authorities with predatory sub-prime lending across the country. By acquiring HFC, HSBC took on the bank’s debt recovery business on behalf of leading British high-street retailers relating to the use of store cards, including B&Q, Dixons, Currys, PC World, Furniture Village, among others.

That year, under the mantle of its new ownership by HSBC, HFC also acquired the store card business of the John Lewis Partnership, the reputable department store that also owns supermarket chain, Waitrose. The store card debt recovery work for retailers like John Lewis was operated on behalf of HSBC/HFC by two firms of solicitors, Weightmans LLP and Restons.

An appropriately rubbish random photo of the HSBC logo

Nicholas Wilson, who was then head of debt recovery at Weightmans and had acted for John Lewis for 25 years, discovered that both Weightmans and Restons added so-called “collection charges” of 16.4% to the store card debt they were collecting on accounts that were in arrears — possibly for as long as 20 years. Charges would range from anywhere between £500 and £5,000.

The addition of those so-called “collection charges,” though, was thoroughly illegal. Rather than charging HSBC for its debt collection work, the solicitors were with the bank’s approval arbitrarily adding these “contingency fees” to the debt owed, which they took for themselves, in flagrant violation of the very consumer credit agreements that they were supposed to be collecting on. Those credit agreements did not allow consumers to be charged such fees.

No sooner had HSBC acquired John Lewis’ store card business through its subsidiary HFC, the illegal charges that were already being applied to so many other retailers were added to John Lewis’ accounts.

“I handled John Lewis debt collection for over 20 years and negotiated my firm’s contract with HSBC/HFC,” said Nicholas Wilson. “The illegal arrangement was between the solicitors and the bank, and I told them all at the very first meeting it was illegal.”

Despite repeated reminders from Wilson about their illegality, his complaints were ignored.

By 2006, Wilson could no longer stomach the fraudulent fees that were being applied to accounts handled by HSBC for retailers like John Lewis and many others. As many as 600,000 people, he estimates, were being defrauded.

He went to the Law Society and blew the whistle. Weightmans then made Wilson redundant. The Law Society oversaw a mediation process between Wilson and HSBC, in which the Society eventually concluded that the solicitors had no right to charge consumers the excess fees.

Neither Weightmans nor Reston solicitors responded to requests for comment.

Cover-up

Wilson’s tireless efforts to expose HSBC’s £1 billion fraud, at considerable personal expense to his own health and well-being, have been systematically stonewalled to this day.

He writes on his blog, where he has published some of the evidence relating to his case:

“After a 12 year struggle trying to expose massive fraud by HSBC, having lost my job; nearly lost my home and facing new repossession proceedings; having damaged my mental and physical health to the extent that I am probably no longer capable of working; and having met and talked to many whistleblowers in similar situations, my conclusion is do not blow the whistle in the UK, unless it’s a matter of life and death.”

After being made redundant, Wilson wrote to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to obtain copies of all the claims that Weightmans and Restons had made against debtors, which are obtainable under Freedom of Information. He wanted to obtain as much documentary evidence as possible about the fraud. But the MoJ concocted a questionable loophole to avoid handing Wilson the information.

Eventually, in November 2010, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) responded to Wilson’s campaign by issuing an order against HSBC/HFC demanding that it either discontinue the collection charges, or amend the consumer credit agreements to transparently incorporate them into the terms and conditions. HSBC eventually stopped the fraud, but nothing has been done to recompense consumers from the billion pounds worth of fees fraudulently collected.

When Wilson contacted the FSA in 2012 about the fraud, they did nothing. Two years later, the FSA’s successor body, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), belatedly decided to explain the basis of its decision to do nothing. But shockingly, the letter written by this supposedly independent regulatory watchdog body literally cut and pasted portions of a letter written by HSBC’s own legal team. Financial journalist, Ian Fraser, exposed the incident, concluding that:

“HFC/HSBC and the Financial Conduct Authority have been caught red handed, and Wilson accuses them of colluding to cover up a £1 billion fraud. He says that, if the bank was to be obliged to compensate the 500,000–600,000 people it has allegedly fleeced, it would need to pay them an average of £1,500 (with interest) each.”

Wilson’s next move is to complain about the FCA’s collusion. But, he told me: “To further complain about the FCA I have to go to the Complaints Commissioner, one Anthony Townsend who was head of SRA when they covered up the same fraud.”

Last month, Conservative MP Jess Norman questioned FCA chief Martin Wheatley in parliament at a Treasury Select Committee hearing, on its apparent collusion with HSBC in dismissing Wilson’s disclosures of the fraud conducted against British consumers.

Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, poses for a Bloomberg News photo-shoot. Presumably, this sort of photo is supposed to help convince us how deadly serious he is about regulating the financial industry

Despite admitting that HSBC had “lied” about the legitimacy of the collection charges against consumer debt, that “fraud” had potentially occurred, and that the FCA did possess “supervisory and enforcement powers” to address the fraud, Wheatley justified the FCA’s failure to apply those powers on the grounds of having “a multitude of other calls on our resources.” Taking such action, he claimed, would be “disproportionate.”

“Well, I am speechless,” said Jesse Norman, clearly taken aback.

A spokesperson for HSBC declined to comment on Wilson’s allegations of fraud.

Censorship

The full-scale of the fraud targeted at consumers by banks in the name of debt recovery is unknown. What is known, is that such practices have happened in different ways elsewhere, and could be continuing with impunity in forms that are routinely concealed with the collusion of regulators.

“There will be many consumers who are still paying the illegal charges because they will be paying in installments,” said Wilson. The credit card firm American Express, he added, “were also adding unlawful charges and the OFT made an order against them at the same time as HSBC/HFC. I am sure the practice is rife in debt recovery — I have been told of many instances where a debt has been passed on or sold and suddenly there’s a big jump in the amount due.”

The biggest victims of such fraud are those with low-income. HFC’s other businesses, for instance, included a personal loan scheme, which ran through about 125 branches at retailers up and down the UK, but often in some of the poorest areas. I have also seen very similar reports from consumers being pursued by debt collection agencies on behalf of leading British companies, where large fees are unilaterally added on top of the debt payment.

Wilson said:

“The industry needs investigating but it’s not glamorous or sexy so I doubt it ever will be.”

Most disturbing of all, the story of HSBC’s fraud against British consumers has been systematically ignored by the entire British press. In some cases, purportedly brave investigative journalism outfits have spent months investigating the story, preparing multiple drafts, before inexplicably spiking publication without reason.

To date, the only mainstream coverage Wilson has received was a brief appearance on BBC’s The Big Questions. That is not for want of understanding the story.

The full list of media organisations that have investigated, then spiked, Wilson’s story, despite its unprecedented importance and public interest value, includes BBC Panorama, BBC Newsnight, BBC Moneybox, BBC Radio 5 Live, The Guardian, Private Eye, and most recently, The Sunday Times.

“All of the major publications and broadcasters live in constant fear of being sued by City of London firms with deep pockets and aggressive panels of lawyers,” said Joel Benjamin, campaigner for Move Your Money UK.

In 2013, Benjamin recalled, Move Your Money obtained a consumer marketing report sponsored by City of London financial firms, which confirmed a huge exodus of 2.4 million high street bank customers away from the big four banks after the Libor scandal that had exposed colossal levels of fraud and collusion amongst major London banks. The BBC was planning to cover the story as an exclusive, “but pulled at the last minute, following intervention by the City lobby, namely the British Bankers Association threatening legal action.”

Still, why would there be such a huge degree of censorship on Wilson’s story on HSBC fraud, but abundant coverage of the HSBC Swiss bank tax evasion scandal? The scandal, points out Benjamin, is not related to UK crimes, or issues that might threaten HSBC’s continued operation in the UK. Given that HSBC has subsidiaries in 556 tax havens around the world, he said, the bank can “deal with a tax avoidance scandal in one of these jurisdictions, and continue relatively unscathed.”

But there is another issue, which relates to the scale of such fraud in the UK, and its contribution to economic growth. London, even more than Wall Street, is the world’s finance capital, harbouring most of the global economy’s international transactions, and therefore holding 400% more money than Britain’s entire GDP. A significant quantity of this money — “many hundreds of billions of pounds” worth — is from the criminal economy and laundered through UK banks and their subsidiaries. As Benjamin said:

“What the British government cannot tell the public is that the current growth model for the UK economy revolves around the endorsement and protection of financial sector fraud.”

The exposure of HSBC’s fraud in Britain could fundamentally jeopardise both the bank’s domestic and US operations.

The best journalism money can buy

The threat of legal action is only one part of the explanation for the reluctance of the British media to pursue such critical issues. The other dimension is that HSBC has gone to great efforts to capture as much of the media as it possibly can.

In August last year, HSBC director Rona Fairhead was appointed as chair of the BBC’s board of trustees. Fairhead is currently chair of HSBC’s North America Holdings, and was chair of the audit and risk committee when HSBC was fined by US authorities for money-laundering. Some of the fraud exposed in the Swiss leaks occurred during her watch on the committee. Before her government nomination to the BBC, Fairhead was appointed a British Business Ambassador by Prime Minister David Cameron. Prior to that, she had been a non-executive board director for the UK Cabinet Office under the coalition government.

Rona Fairhead, chair of the BBC Trust, is also a director and shareholder at HSBC

As former BBC newsman and Radio 5 Live executive Bill Rogers reports, Fairhead owns a total of some 76,254 HSBC shares, collectively worth an estimated £436,000. Over the year, she earned £494,000 in fees and £19,000 in benefits from HSBC.

The Guardian, in contrast, has loudly and triumphantly congratulated itself for reporting on the HSBC Swiss bank scandal despite the bank putting its advertising relationship with the newspaper “on pause.” Yet the newspaper has refused to cover Wilson’s story exposing HSBC fraud in Britain. Why?

Here’s something you won’t read in the Guardian. During the Treasury Select Committee meeting on 15th February, it emerged that the newspaper that styles itself as the world’s “leading liberal voice” happens to be the biggest recipient of HSBC advertising revenue: bigger even than the Telegraph.

According to the Guardian Media Group’s annual financial review last year, its American website, Guardian US, delivered “record online traffic” in the form of over 20 million unique monthly users “representing year-on-year growth of 12%.” User growth permitted a dramatic increase in advertising revenues: “Revenues from US operations more than doubled on the previous 12-month period, reflecting advertising demand and sponsorship deals with partners such as HSBC, Netflix and Airbnb.”

HSBC’s “partnership” with the Guardian Media Group has thus played an integral role in enabling the Guardian’s US venture to maximise its revenues, and expand its work.

The Guardian’s links with HSBC go beyond mere advertising. Much has been made of the fact that the newspaper is owned and run by The Scott Trust, originally created in 1936 “to safeguard the title’s journalistic freedom.” The paper, wrote leftwing columnist Owen Jones in the wake of Peter Oborne’s revelations, “is unique for being owned by a trust rather than a media mogul.”

I have a lot of respect for Jones, who is doing important work, but his assertion here is untrue and misleading.

The Guardian is not owned by a trust at all. In 2008, “the trust was replaced with a limited company” that was accordingly re-named “The Scott Trust Limited.” Though not a trust at all, but simply a profit-making company, it is still referred to frequently as ‘The Scott Trust,’ promulgating the widely-held but mistaken belief in the Guardian’s inherently benign ownership structure.

The new company purports, like many other corporate entities, to be guided by a range of commendable values, including the task of maintaining the Guardian’s editorial independence. The problem, of course, is that the Guardian functions under the same sort of corporate structure as any other major media company.

The chair of the Scott Trust Ltd. board is Dame Liz Forgan, who has repeatedly called for the financial sector to contribute more to the arts. Two years ago, her attitude to the sector was revealed when she described government tax-cuts to the wealthy as “helpful changes in the tax law,” but opined that the “huge new wealth created in the City” as a result was only problematic because it is not “finding its way to the arts.” British financiers, she suggested, should follow the exemplary model of Russian oligarchs, who “respect and value their culture.” It is difficult to understand how corrupt oligarchs with nothing better to do than lavish stolen wealth on obscene ‘artistic’ pursuits of concern to a tiny Russian minority should in anyway be considered a model for Britain, given the record levels of impoverishment in Russia (thanks in no small part to neo-liberal austerity), not to mention growing inequality in the UK manifest in demand for food banks which in 2013 had rocketed up by 54%.

Forgan is deputy chair of the board of the British Museum, where she was appointed a trustee in 2008. According to minutes of a British Museum board meeting that year, the board approved a bank mandate to open an HSBC account that would facilitate “HSBC being a sponsor of Museum activities.” Forgan is also patron of St. Giles Trust, which since 2013 has been sponsored by HSBC as part of its three year ‘Opportunity Partnership.’

Conspiracy? Coincidence? Either way, the chair of the company that owns the Guardian, the biggest recipient of HSBC digital advertising revenue, is involved in facilitating HSBC contributions to two institutions.

Apart from Forgan, the rest of the Scott Trust Ltd.’s board consists of ex-journalists and financiers, all of whom are shareholders in the Trust, which in turn is the sole shareholder of Guardian Media Group, and which is thus responsible for overseeing how the Group manages and re-invests Guardian profits. They must juggle the task of operating the Guardian “as a profit-seeking enterprise,” while securing its “financial and editorial independence” — goals that as the HSBC case illustrates, are ultimately mutually incompatible.

Alongside Forgan is Anthony Salz, a senior investment banker and executive vice chairman of Rothschild, and a director at NM Rothschild and Sons. He was a key legal adviser to Guinness during the notorious share-rigging scandal, helped Rupert Murdoch form BSkyB, and was vice chair of the BBC’s Board of Governors before it was replaced by the BBC Trust. He was also lead non-executive director of the board at the Department for Education under arch-neoconservative Michael Gove. Until 2006, Salz led a highly successful 30 year career as a corporate lawyer at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, where he was head and senior managing partner since 1996.

Anthony Salz, a Rothschild investment banker who helped Rupert Murdoch with BSkyB, oversees the Guardian as a Scott Trust Ltd. executive

One of Freshfield’s most prominent long-term clients is HSBC. In 2012, Salz’s former firm was appointed to advise HSBC on its record $1.9 billion fine from US authorities for money-laundering, regarding its UK law implications. Although that occurred well after Salz’s time, HSBC’s relationship with Freshfields had been consolidated under Salz’s tenure shortly before he left, establishing an advisory monopoly on much of HSBC’s corporate work in Asia, and displacing the rival firm Norton Rose as HSBC’s advisor of choice.

Forgan and Salz are accompanied on the Scott Trust Ltd.’s board by Philip Tranter, a former partner and head of corporate law at the firm, Boyes Turner, where he led on major corporate transactions as well as banking and finance. Tranter is still a consultant for the firm. Among Boyes Turner’s corporate clients are most major British banks: including HSBC.

Also on the Scott Trust Ltd. board is Jonathan Scott, chairman of Ambac Assurance UK, and a former director at KPMG Corporate Finance. Ambac Assurance is a UK subsidiary Ambac Assurance, which in turn is part of the Ambac Financial Group based in New York. Ambac played a major role in underwriting dodgy derivatives at the heart of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, and was implicated in fraud to save its skin as the crisis kicked off — but still managed to obtain a $700 million government bailout that even the Internal Revenue Service agreed was unwarranted.

Andrew Miller, another Scott Trust Ltd. board member, was chief financial officer of Autotrader publisher, Trader Media Group, which was jointly owned by the Guardian Media Group and the giant private equity firm, Apax Partners. One director of an early Apax Fund, Apax Europe IV, that closed in 1999, is David Staples, who is currently director of what he calls “five large private equity funds managed by Apax Partners.” Simultaneously, David Staples is a director of HSBC Private Bank Ltd. Early last year, the Guardian Media Group sold its remaining 50.1% stake in Trader Media Group to Apax Funds. The Guardian was advised on the transaction by Bank of America, Merrill Lynch — and by Anthony Salz’s former firm, Freshfields, which also last year advised HSBC over a government inquiry into competition in the banking sector.

The Guardian and the Telegraph are hardly the only newspapers with large, long-term sponsorship deals, and intersecting relationships, with HSBC.

The week before last, the Sunday Times was preparing to run a big exposé on the HSBC consumer credit fraud. The story was ready to go, but at the last minute was inexplicably dropped. HSBC happens to be the main sponsor of a series of Sunday Times league tables published for FastTrack 100 Ltd., a “networking events company.” The bank is the “title sponsor” of The Sunday Times HSBC Top Track 100, has been “title sponsor of The Sunday Times HSBC International Track 200 for all 6 years” and was previously “title sponsor of The Sunday Times Top Track 250 for 7 years.”

FastTrack annual league table supplements and awards programmes have created networks of powerful capitalists “ranging from tech entrepreneurs to those who run and own the biggest private companies.”

A query sent to the Sunday Times journalist preparing the spiked story received no response.

Another publication that spiked Wilson’s story is Private Eye. The well-known muckraking magazine had pursued the story for months, interviewed multiple relevant sources, fact-checked documents, and had prepared a final, formatted draft that bar some copy-editing, was virtually print-ready.

But as with other outlets, Private Eye unexpectedly dropped the story at the last minute with no explanation. Private Eye’s editor said that he was “unable to comment” on the matter when asked why the story was spiked.

Blood money

HSBC’s effective immunity from meaningful sanction or accountability from government can be gleaned from disclosures in the US about the bank’s systematic complicity in criminal financing involving Islamist terrorism, drug-trafficking, money-laundering, among other things.

As investigative journalist Matt Taibbi wrote in Rolling Stone, the $1.9 billion in fines leveled at HSBC by the US Justice Department was for “the largest drug-and-terrorism money-laundering case ever.” The settlement was a mere slap on the wrist, equivalent to “about five weeks’ profit,” that allowed the bank to completely evade prosecutions.

Yet HSBC had engaged in aiding and abetting murder and terror on a grand scale — because organised crime is exceedingly profitable. Clients requiring criminal services can be charged any rate, allowing for literally fantastical scales of profit.

Much of HSBC’s misdemeanours were documented in an extensive 2012 report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Amongst its damning findings was HSBC’s longstanding relationship with Saudi Arabia’s al-Rajhi bank, described by the CIA in 2003 as a “conduit for extremist finance.” US intelligence assessed that al-Rajhi founder Sulaiman bin Abdul Aziz was a member of Osama bin Laden’s ‘Golden Chain’ financiers of al-Qaeda, and had in that capacity pushed al-Rahji bank to find ways to avoid subjecting the bank’s charitable donations to official scrutiny.

Sheikh Sulaiman bin Abdul Azis, founder of al-Qaeda sponsoring al-Rajhi Bank, and idolised HSBC client

In 2003, HSBC was ordered by the US Federal Reserve to cease-and-desist its relationships with clients like al-Rahji. HSBC refused to do so, deceptively ending ties with al-Rahji bank and continuing relations with ‘al-Rahji Trading’ instead. Meanwhile, HSBC continued to engage dodgy clients, racking up dozens of repeated government warnings which it simply ignored. By 2006, the Bush administration canceled the 2003 cease-and-desist order, and HSBC almost immediately provided a billion dollars to al-Rahji. HSBC went on to launder money for Mexican and Colombian drug-cartels, criminal syndicates run out of foreign embassies, and countries under US sanctions like Iran and North Korea.

As Taibbi reveals, though, HSBC senior executives in London headquarters appeared to be fully aware of such activity: “… the chiefs in the parent company often knew about shady transactions when the regional subsidiary did not.” In the words of the Senate report, “HSBC was fully aware of the suspicions that al-Rajhi Bank and its owners were associated with terrorist financing, describing many of the alleged links in the al-Rajhi Bank client profile.”

By 2010, HSBC had racked up a backlog of 17,000 suspicious activity alerts that it had simply ignored. Yet the bank’s standard response when it received its next government cease-and-desist order was simply to ‘clear’ the alerts, and give assurances that everything was fine. According to former HSBC compliance officer and whistleblower Everett Stern, the bank’s executives were deliberately ignoring and violating anti-money laundering regulations. The Senate report found that HSBC had “exposed the US financial system to a wide array of money laundering, drug trafficking, and terrorist financing risks.”

Why did the US government avoid seeking criminal charges and prosecutions against HSBC, despite its unambiguous track record of financial crimes? The explanation of then Justice Department criminal division chief, Lanny Breuer, is telling:

“Had the US authorities decided to press criminal charges, HSBC would almost certainly have lost its banking license in the US, the future of the institution would have been under threat and the entire banking system would have been destabilised.”

Breuer was rewarded amply by Wall Street for his kindness. The following year, he landed a job at his former law firm, Covington and Burling, with a salary of $4 million.

Though Breuer’s excuse seems facetious, it is also revealing. Governments are fully aware that the organised criminal economy is so huge, and so systemically entwined with the global banking system, that it cannot be shut down without fundamentally transforming both politics and economics together.

Terrorism finance expert Dr. Loretta Napoleoni, an economist who advises governments on counter-terrorism and money laundering, estimates the total value of the global criminal economy to be about $1.5 trillion annually. The bulk of this criminal finance “flows into Western economies, where it gets recycled in the US and in Europe” as a “vital element of the cash flow of these economies.”

Estimates by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and the IMF suggest that organised crime amounts to around 3–5% of global GDP.

Ten years ago, a Newsweek investigation described the “exponential growth in illicit trade across the world.” While global trade has roughly doubled since 1990, the criminal economy has grown tenfold. Organised crime, in other words, is one of the biggest growth sectors under neoliberal capitalism.

“Since illicit trades can thrive only with government complicity, this means that traffickers are investing huge sums to gain political influence, and not just in their home countries,” wrote Newsweek.

Indeed, most criminal finance runs through Western banks, especially in London. The bulk of profits from the Colombian drug trade, for instance — about 97% — are laundered for criminal syndicates through banks “in first-world consuming countries.” Dr. Alejandro Gaviria, an economist at the University of the Andes, Bogota, who co-authored a landmark study of the global drug trade funded by the Colombian government, said:

“We know that authorities in the US and UK know far more than they act upon. The authorities realise things about certain people they think are moving money for the drug trade — but the DEA [US Drugs Enforcement Administration] only acts on a fraction of what it knows.”

The underground criminal economy, writes Newsweek, is now “truly multinational, weaving together global networks of political allies and generating profits on an unprecedented scale.” As governments have continued to deregulate the economy, lower tariffs, eliminate currency controls and open up economies to foreign investment, the criminal economy and bank profits have flourished together.

Former BBC and Channel 4 executive producer David Malone, author of The Debt Generation, thus underscores the symbiotic links between the mainstream financial system and criminal finance:

“We, the rich West, use it, we finance it, we provide the laundering services for it, and we then use the money it generates to feed the financial system. That money keeps our banks going, especially in hard times. That money is what is used by the financial industry to speculate with, to buy up sovereign assets with, to speculate on food with. That money helps create their bonuses and pays off our politicians in ‘soft donations’ and ‘access to decision makers.’”

Too big to jail?

In 2013, MI5 chief Jonathan Evans joined the board of HSBC Holdings as a non-executive director after retiring. The year after, Evans was appointed to the board of the UK government’s National Crime Agency, a multi-agency partnership between the police, law enforcement, public sector and private industry to lead the fight against serious and organised crime, including of course financial crime.

Ironically, on the pretext of filling a “skills gap,” one of the first things the NCA did upon replacing the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), was sign up a force of unpaid bankers, accountants and lawyers — the very sectors harbouring the criminal economy — to ‘help’ the agency tackle cyber crime, drug-trafficking, fraud and corruption, among other crimes.

In July 2013, career police officer Nick Lewis, a senior director at SOCA who led law-enforcement engagement with US authorities on organised crime and drug-trafficking in the Caribbean, left the force. By the time SOCA had transitioned into the NCA, Lewis had landed a job in HSBC Group HQ’s Financial Crime Compliance unit as ‘global head of law enforcement liaison.’ His job, in other words, is liaising with his former police colleagues.

A cursory inspection of Lewis’ LinkedIn profile reveals that he is closely connected to, and has received multiple recommendations from, numerous incumbent senior law-enforcement officers at the NCA who should, in fact, be investigating HSBC, as well as active intelligence and law-enforcement officials from the US and Canada.

Although Nicholas Wilson reported his allegations of fraud to British police, they refused to investigate. I asked the NCA why they had failed to investigate the colossal allegations of HSBC fraud, which one would think would be a major priority for a law-enforcement agency whose entire remit is that sort of crime. I received no response.

No one’s too big to jail: what you can do

Nicholas Wilson’s revelations on HSBC fraud in Britain constitute the worst and largest single case of banking fraud to have ever emerged in this country. They make the Swiss leaks case look like peanuts. And yet their cause is something apparently mundane and routine: debt collection for high-street retailers.

The impunity with which the bank was able to carry out such fraud in cahoots with leading law firms, and the conspiracy of silence across regulators, law-enforcement agencies, and the media that has protected the bank’s reputation at home, underscores the truly colossal scale of corruption across powerful British institutions.

Governments may well be too co-opted to take action. Our ‘free media’ may be too pathetically subservient to corporate power to give the story the space it deserves.

But citizens aren’t.

Nicholas Wilson, who has blown the whistle on HSBC fraud at home, is not giving up. Last month, Wilson launched an unprecedented crowdfunding campaign to launch a private prosecution against HSBC and its lawyers for fraud and conspiracy to defraud. He is aiming to raise 100,000 pounds by 17th April to pay for barristers to take on the case.

If Wilson’s campaign succeeds, and he is able to launch his prosecution, the results could be dramatic. HSBC has never been prosecuted for its crimes — and certainly not for the UK component of its crimes against British consumers, which most of the captured British media have suppressed.

A successful prosecution against HSBC would not only help shut down the bank’s illegal activities in the UK and the US, but could open the way for citizens to bring a whole range of criminal prosecutions against dozens of financial institutions that, for far too long, have committed crimes against citizens in the comfortable belief that they are too big to jail.

You can be part of that movement to hold corrupt financiers to account, by supporting this citizen-led initiative for a criminal prosecution of HSBC’s fraud here.

"‘Customer service is not part of our job. It IS our job’ Russell Quirk, CEO emoov.co.uk","‘Customer service is not part of our job. It IS our job’ Russell Quirk, CEO emoov.co.uk

Whilst our high street competitors view customer service as something that is achieved simply by deigning to answer the telephone sometimes, our online peers have certainly joined us in understanding that delivering a great experience is paramount. As a web based business, demonstrable and genuine accolades of such prowess are pretty important in cutting through to the sceptical consumer.

Competition amongst online estate agents to be the best is pretty intense. Most achieve a decent level of customer satisfaction according to the various third party review websites and indeed this is something, of late, that is now displayed proudly on many a site self-proclaiming various companies as leaders in looking after people.

So who really has the edge?

Well, in a sector of such high standards in comparison to the traditional establishment, it must be tough to establish when looking from the outside in. Where numerous sites such as Feefo; Trust Pilot and Review Centre are full of platitudes for many, it comes down to a couple of things…

Firstly, the achievement of awards which focus on customer service in that specific sector. A rubber-stamp as such.

Secondly, the comments that real customers make and that, importantly, do not just talk of how the selling or buying experience was ‘good’; ‘great’ or ‘impressive’. But that the many months of stress and procrastination associated with an antiquated legal process, actually became a pleasure. That dealing with a particular company or individual went above and beyond.

In November 2014 eMoov.co.uk was awarded the Best Customer Service Award across the online estate agency space. We beat all of the many internet based estate agents to be crowned number one by AllAgents.co.uk, the UK’s largest estate agency review website and which has collected over 100,000 customer reviews.

Then, just this week, the same third party announced that we had climbed to within the top 10 of ALL estate agency branches in the country for provable service delivery as rated by over 500 of our customers. There are no other online estate agents within the top 40 currently.

Plus we have a 98% customer satisfaction rating on various review sites and as built up over the five years of our existence to date. That’s over 7000 customers.

We’re really proud of that but even more so, proud of the comments that our customers make about us. Here’s some from this week:

Thinking of Making a Whiteboard Animation? Read This First!,"Thanks to software like VideoScribe, almost anyone can make a whiteboard animation video. But even though the software is easy to use, there is still a learning curve. After producing my first few videos this year, I’ve come up with some helpful pointers I wished I’d known when starting out. If you’re thinking about creating a whiteboard animation, these eight tips will save you time and effort and help you produce an engaging video.

Know your audience. Who will watch your video? What’s the main point(s) you want to convey to them? How will you do that in a meaningful way? And what’s your call to action — what do you want your audience to do after receiving your message? It’s tough to write an effective script without answering these questions. Polish your script. Part of the appeal of a whiteboard animation is its simplicity. Script writers, once you’re clear on your audience and begin drafting your script, try reading it out loud. You’ll quickly realize that what looks wonderful on the page might not sound so good when spoken. You may notice some overly complex sentences that need to be streamlined. Succinct sentences pair better with your animation and convey your message more efficiently to your audience. Use a title that connects with your audience. A title should provide a glimpse into the story but be concise. Use language that is understandable to a wide audience, and skip the jargon. For example, if your organization uses certain terminology that won’t resonate with the intended audience, say health workers, it’s probably wise to skip it. For more information on crafting a good title, read To Click or Not to Click: The Art of a Good Title. Understand your software’s limits. There are always limits to what you can accomplish with technology without getting into building custom code. In VideoScribe, the main limitations I’ve experienced are with its Image Library. There are not as many illustration files as I’d like, especially public health and health care images. You can modify text color, but you can’t make any changes to the image files themselves. You can upload your own image file, but it will appear as full image instead of the gradual hand-drawn materialization distinctive to a whiteboard animation. Don’t get hung up on these limits, though! The key is to know what they are so you can figure out how to work around them. You might even find that the restrictions feed your creativity to produce something fresh and unexpected. Timing is everything. Lining up illustrations for key points in your script is realistic. Lining up an illustration for every single point in your script is impossible — and even if it were possible, it would be overwhelming to your audience. It is all about timing. Trying to include too many illustrations can make the video feel rushed and leave the audience feeling confused. Credit your sources. Think about the acknowledgements section of your video before publishing it. Who contributed to the script? Who narrated? What organizations’ logos need to be included? Have you referenced a finding or anecdote from a publication? Have you used someone’s photograph? And while we’re on the subject… Do you have permission to use that? If the VideoScribe library doesn’t have the illustration you’re looking for, you can upload your own photograph, screenshot, logo, graphic, or other image. A number of online repositories offer free images. For example, Pixabay allows users to search more than 370,000 photos and illustrations without copyright issues or attribution requirements. And Photoshare provides thousands of international public health and development images, free for nonprofit and educational use. If you use a photograph or image found on another organization’s website, be sure to ask permission from the originator. Be prepared to spend extra time in the narration phase. It’s a lot harder than you’d think to not flub up your words while reading a two- to three-minute script. You might need to make five or more recordings to get one good one. To get it right sooner, remember the following tips:

Speak slowly and audibly, and enunciate your words.

Eliminate as much background noise as possible — turn off your email, silence your phone, close a window, and alert office mates.

You don’t need fancy equipment. I just used a standard Skype-type microphone with my desktop computer and a MacBook without a microphone.

Record 5 to 10 seconds of silence at the beginning and end of the narration to allow space for the title and credit information.

5 simple reasons why you should start blogging today,"In addition to LetsSeeWhatWorks.com, I’ve started many other blogs with the aim to hit the heart of the market and make a profit. Even when the ideas are just coming and everything is far from perfect, I still only take a brief contemplation period and then I launch. Why?

It’s simple. It is now easier than ever to get started with something. For years, gurus floated through the blogosphere this idea that “content marketing” was the only way to succeed. Your product needs to be not only a good one, but a truly sustainable one in terms of visibility and largesse. And it doesn’t all come together by chance.

In the world of the internet there are about 179 million blogs. Perhaps only a handful of the online businesses can truly be deemed successful, but they all have one thing in common:

They all started somewhere.

Well-known German examples (where I´m living) that I’ve watched for years and would like to single out are: Sascha Pallenberg’s blog Mobilegeeks (launched in 2012, now 25,000 daily visitors), t3n.de (started in 2005 and today has more than 70,000 visits daily), Planetbackpack.de (launched in 2012, today about 4000 daily visitors), selbstaendig-in-netz.de (started about 2007, today over 5000 readers per day).

All of them, meaning the people behind it and founders, live today from their blogs.

Most companies fit in the category of “company with several employees and an editorial team” that help push the popularity forward. There are however, still some bloggers who get a good and stable profit, either through the sale of advertising space, as commercial recommender (affiliates), or by consultant fees, which are possible thanks to the blog’s brand.

Now you will think for sure: They’re all big. I don’t want to be so big. Do what you wish, but how big or expansive you become is completely in your hands. In addition, you can do something important with your blog…more important than some “for sale” banner space at the bottom.

Creating a blog costs (almost) nothing

Before I enumerate all the long-term benefits, I briefly want to look at the short-term. One need secure large investments nor must he or she have in-depth technical website-startup knowledge in order to start a blog. A blog doesn’t have to be perfectly executed at the beginning and the concept need not be fixed. A blog is an incubator for ideas and the exact place monthly and yearly goals can be formed. Every business must evolve, even a blog. The analogy to planting seeds I find quite appropriate here. You plant the seeds and then you have to pay attention. Is there enough water? Are the surroundings good for growth? What about the sunlight? Too much? Not enough? Depending on how well you care for the seeds during this process, the blog will grow fast or slow, straight or crooked, big or small.

Creating a blog is a breeze these days and requires virtually zero technical knowledge. But somewhere, starts every time.

But one step after another.

The top 5 reasons why you should create a blog

Argument 1: You do not need much, just the passion that you have already

When you have something to blog about, you don’t need much. You just need a concrete idea to begin with, something to get you going thematically. It could be a personal thing like cooking, art or literature, but it could also be a technical thing. Our top for LSWW is “Entrepreneurship” because it is my thing! So, the basic idea starts you out and, after the first blog post is written, the development begins.

For example, I started Happy Coffee because I wanted to be in the foreground of blogs discussing sustainability and fair trade…not to mention coffee’s role in all that. We aim to inform, persuade, and possibly provoke a change in the behavior of consumers in regard to sustainability.

Argument 2: A blog needs to ripen, like good wine

Aging is good, at least in the blogosphere. There are always statistics involved: the domain’s age, the time from post-to-post, the visitor clicks. Everything is important and everything is relevant when we are talking about achieving your audience and sustainability, as others have done. Because: most traffic comes through Google search results. In order to get the traffic, the following basic rules must be observed:

Write good and relevant content (with heart, soul, and clarity!)

Write regularly

Note the SEO Basics

Tell others about it (so you can get backlinks)

Those who do not take the initiative will never start in this growth process. So begin, get going, and ripen!

Argument 3: You can build your brand through your blog

A brand is not built overnight. It has be grow, necessitating both time and regular content.

Why is it important to establish a brand? Here’s an example using one of the most valuable brands in the world: Apple. Think about it — quality, simplicity, beauty, functionality. If someone asks me why I use Apple devices, then my answer is: because it just works.

What made Steve Jobs did with the Apple brand is of course on a completely different level. But the principle also works for a smaller brand. Anyone getting to know me for the first time knows immediately that I’m passionate about startups and entrepreneurship.

A good thing, because branding creates a trust bond between the brand and customers, business partners, investors, blog readers, and and and…

And then the value of the brand is really clear.

If you want to create a blog, you should be quite clear that every blog needs a great deal of personality. A blog lives by its contributors. These personalities are automatically added to the “Social Trademark” and then associated with their topic.

Your blog is your brand’s “skin.” Tattoo it with themes and posts that build up the brand you want.

Argument 4: Traffic = Money

There are a few basic laws on the internet and one of them is: the true currency in the Internet is traffic. If you have thousands of visitors every month first on your blog, then you can make money with this exposure.

There are many models for it: affiliate, advertising, products, … the possibilities are practically limitless. But your parents and grandparents were right:

Nothing comes from nothing.

Your roadmap for a successful online business with a successful blog looks like this:

Create a blog with a fixed topic Generate traffic Monetize (make money) Scale (decide how big you want to be)

Argument 5: Creating a blog takes 15 minutes and costs around € 3.60 / month (or nothing, if you start on medium.com)

This is an argument that has become codified in recent years. It truly is simple and does not require technical knowledge. It does not always have to be created through the ever-popular WordPress, alternatives like Jimdo can also help you get going easily in 2 minutes. I’d like to show you a few possibilities on how to set up your blog:

Bluehost: Inexpensive providers with a simple 1-click WordPress installation

The Utah (USA)-based host provider Bluehost has been around since 2003. Here for around $5/month, you get great hosting for your blog. From the domain to the mail server, everything is included, well explained and easily understandable, even for beginners.

The support also helps via chat (I’ve even used it several times). Several of my blogs run on Bluehost (including LSWW) and I am completely satisfied. Especially handy is the one-click WordPress Installer. The latest version of WordPress is quickly and easily installed on your server, and you are immediately “blog ready.”

Jimdo — Drag’n Drop model, extremely easy handling

Also highly recommended for use by some pages is Jimdo. The Hamburg-based company has over 10 million users and has long since grown out of the startup stage. I know the team behind Jimdo personally and am always glad to visit them (not only because of Sam’s fantastic cuisine).

Anyone interested in a company with a great deal of heart, don’t miss working with Jimdo. By the way, here is an interview (german) from our Startup Tour of 2011.

Before I moved Happy Coffee to WordPress and BlueHost, I was at Jimdo (only because we blog so much more did I moved) An example of how Jimdo looks like? Have a look…you simply click on the text in the page and changed on the surface. In a simple way, one can really create any blog.

Truly, anyone can!

If you want to get started without your own domain, something like MYBLOG.jimdo.com, could also work (but it’s not recommended because it would be harder to grow the brand).

So rather invest € 60/year and have decent and desirable domain with support.

If you are still reading this article …

Then … first, thanks! But you have clearly understood the importance and relevance of a blog.

Take your chance and go to the drawing board. Creating a blog is really not rocket science. In 2 years you will smile and rejoice about this moment.

And if something is messed up: what can you lose? €60 and a little time. The reward is worth that small risk.

In conversation with Sister Jasmin: Waswasa and Mental Wellbeing (Part 1),"How do you keep satanic whispers at bay? How do you avoid baseless misgivings? How can you improve your mental wellbeing? How can you pursue a life of positivity and hope? Does depression mean you are lacking in faith?

We spoke to sister Jasmin Ahmed, an ‘aalimah graduated from Jamea Al Kauthar and supporter of Inspirited Minds, after asking our followers to raise some questions for this interview. We pray it raises good awareness, and brings solace to those who are suffering. Part 1 of our interview follows.

There are some sufferers who feel that waswasa (baseless misgivings) are not from shaitaan (Satan) but the self, and thus find it difficult to ignore — do you have any advice toward this?

Waswasa literally means the whisper or rustles. In this aspect it is something secretly repeated in the heart, misgivings or delusion. What needs to be distinguished is the difference between the actual clinical diagnosis of OCD and the waswasa.

OCD is a mental condition […] It causes a person to think about something obsessively to the point that they cannot think about anything else. As such this makes an individual dysfunctional and unable to carry on with their lives normally. For this, medication and therapy will be helpful.

On the other hand, waswasa is the negative thoughts instilled in the heart by shaitaan in order to divert you from your ibaadah (worship) and from living your life as righteous believers. The shaitaan constantly attacks you into believing that you may have not completed an act properly, which then leads to time being wasted or to helplessness so ibaadah is completely disregarded. Or the waswasa creates doubts in one’s minds to the point that one may question the existence of Allah. Conclusively, waswasa is a trap of shaitaan to exhaust the Muslims, tire them and discourage them from worship.

We must remember that firstly, we cannot always control nor resist these thoughts, as they are like intruders. As humans with consciousness, it may be impossible to escape. But as long as the waswasa is unwillingly thought of and not put into practice, one will not be held responsible for it.

Is there anything that can help sufferers to differentiate the waswasa from their own thoughts so that it may be easier for them to ignore it?

Waswasa is the constant doubts that cross the mind repeatedly. It is normal for an individual to, for example, perhaps forget the number of time they have done something. In such a case, there is no problem in repeating the procedure to rid oneself of the doubt. But if that thought doesn’t dissipate after the repetition or continues regularly, then this is waswasa. The scholars encourage sufferers to ignore the whispers completely and accept that their ibaadah is complete and there is no need to take further action.

One should know that waswasa is a sign of strong faith […] shaitaan seeks to destroy the strong believers by installing his whispers into their hearts. Hence why it is often in matters of deen that the waswasa take place.

I think that is also a huge give away for sufferers when wanting to differentiate, that they are being tested in matters of faith and so they should place their trust in God’s mercy and ignore, regardless of how strong the doubt may feel, after all, do the scholars not say that the deen is supposed to be easy and that Allah only asks from us what we are able to give and not that which is beyond what we cannot? Or does our deen demand perfection?

Something every believer needs to remember and especially Mental Health sufferers is that the “deen is easy.” Allah simply requires effort on our behalf in exchange for reward. It is not how much a’maal (deeds) that a person does but rather it is the intention and sincerity of his a’maal that is looked at. Do what you can and to the best of your ability, then leave the rest in Allah’s hands. Just remind yourself everyday that Allah loves for you to try.

For the sufferers’ ease, what are one of the best ways then, perhaps from the sunnah, that could keep the shayateen (devils) at bay?

SubhanAllah there are so many different ways we can safeguard ourselves from shaitaan.

Strive for knowledge. It is the best weapon against all manners of evil as you will learn how to repel the influences of shaitaan and how to cure oneself from it. Never overrate the waswasa, ignore it! It is but a weak whisper of shaitaan but if you pay attention to it and obsess over the whisper, it grows in strength. When you feel the waswasa, relax yourself. There is nothing more irate to shaitaan than the happiness of a believer. If you become upset and contemplate on the waswasa, it will increase, as will your sorrow. Dhikr and duaas. “Verily in the remembrance of Allah, there is contentment of the heart.” Seek His protection from the accursed shaitaan and know that Allah will never leave your side when you carry the Qur’aan in your heart.

May Allah bless the believers who suffer for His sake. I think one thing sufferers may also want to know is if waswasa is correlated with one’s eman (faith), which you briefly touched upon already. Do you have further input in regard to this?

Allahumma aameen. Just like any other illness, waswasa is not something one can control and nor is it something that one is held to accountable for. So your level of emaan has no correlation to whether or not you experience waswasa. Sufferers of the satanic whispers almost always carry the doubt that they must have done something wrong for them to be suffering in this manner. But as believers we need to remember that every aspect of our life has been written for us. We can’t control what is decreed but we can choose how to react to it.

What always comes to mind when speaking of taqdeer (fate) is a quote of Imam Shafi’ee which I think each and everyone of us will find helpful: “My heart is at ease knowing that what was meant for me will never miss me, and that what misses me was never meant for me.”

Sufferers of waswasa should comfort themselves with this … shaitaan knows that they are righteous and he cannot lead them astray by sin. It is for this reason that he attempts to weaken their ibaadah but it is just that, an attempt. And as long as you hold close to Allah, this fortress cannot be penetrated.

Another question was asked more inclined to Mental Health. The person questioned if you can possibly prevent your mind from thinking about what you do not want to think. Have you any advice toward this?

The best way to avoid thinking negatively is the repetition of positive thoughts. Just like dhikr (remembrance of Allah), when we repeat the qualities of Allah to grow closer to Him, by repeating good qualities and attributes of our own, it will help us to embed them in ourselves. So remind yourself that you are a good person. Also know that if these positive thinking techniques are working for you, then they are working only by the will of Allah, and because you had those traits in you already.

Another technique you should try to put into action is forcing yourself to be happy! Don’t contemplate on things that may upset you but get up, get out and go! Do something to distract yourself and you will bring some pleasure to you (within the boundaries of Shari’ah of course).",https://medium.com/inspirited-minds/in-conversation-with-sister-jasmin-waswasa-and-mental-wellbeing-part-1-d54395f035e,['Inspirited Minds'],2015-12-07 21:56:29.528000+00:00,"['Islam', 'Interview', 'Mental Health']"
It’s time to stop generalising religious beliefs,"In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo murders, Swéta Rana argues that religious labels have become dangerously oversimplified.

In Hinduism alone, there are many different denominations and schools of thought. Photo: Flickr/Natesh Ramasamy

There is a school of thought in the world which declares there to be one God who pervades all. Everything in existence subsists of this God, from plants and animals to weather and ethics. Followers of this school believe liberation is achieved through intense meditation, after which one experiences a merge of their consciousness with God, eradicating all distinctions.

There is an opposing school which deems this belief utter bullshit. They use the same texts to argue that the world and God are two completely distinct, separate entities.

Some use the same texts to support their views of monotheism. Others, polytheism. Others, atheism. Others reject these texts altogether, declaring that truth is found through conscious experience or contemplation. Some believers perform rituals. Some rely on meticulous logical principles. Some revere mysticism. Some abstain from meat. Many monotheists maintain the almighty Lord is a benevolent, kind preserver; others see their ultimate deity as a fearsome destroyer. Others still claim the realm of the divine has no traits comparable to humanity.

There is not a single unifying factor among these many philosophies, bar one: they all originated in India. These Indian schools were, understandably, prone to some disagreement or antagonism between faiths. Famous proponents of various creeds wrote extensively on why they believed their path was the correct one. But the situation never escalated into a social or political struggle to assume majority control.

When British anthropologists studied India in the 19thcentury, they were baffled to find this myriad of theological schools in harmonious coexistence. No widespread war, no bitterness, no fierce attempts to dominate or convert. Scratching their heads, they marvelled: “This cannot be! We so rarely have this kind of tolerance in the west. There needs to be some overarching force here. There must be a dominant school, like Christianity. Ah, fuck it: if they’re not bickering they must all essentially be the same — let’s call it Hinduism.”

Humans seem to have an instinctive compulsion to classify the things we encounter. From Aristotle’s extensive classification of all things to prototype theory, we cannot help but admit that things are much easier to process and understand if we are able to categorise. The modern category of “Hinduism”, though, is not a triumph of this process but a crude simplification of it. Labelling the theologies of India under a single term is akin to taking all of your complicated, important paperwork, shoving it into a desk drawer and declaring it successfully filed away. It may be a total jumble of unrelated matters on the inside, but at least it looks neat from afar when you close the drawer.

It is this utter lack of nuance which is damaging our existing conversations about religion. There are sects and denominations within all religions. To say “Christians believe…” or “Muslims follow…” or “All Hindus…” results in an extremely risky, and usually incorrect, statement.

Our reluctance to make distinctions has led to some very simplistic discourse, especially in the wake of the recent Charlie Hebdo attack. Richard Dawkins and Rupert Murdoch are among many who claim the attack can be blamed on the entirety of Islam. Mosques have been attacked in France.

It is a grave indictment on humankind that some of us have indulged in this hysterical Islamophobia. Are we truly so dense that we cannot see a difference between lawfulness and crime, peace and violence, widespread Islam and fundamentalist Islamism?

The Charlie Hebdo attackers may well have claimed to follow the Qur’an. But their beliefs and actions are so utterly removed from the majority of Muslims that it is obscene to place them within the same bracket. It seems humans cannot help but categorise, but this can all too often lead to obfuscation of facts and restricted understanding. Unless we step back and actually acknowledge the distinctions that we see right in front of us, a crime perpetrated by extremist Islamists can too easily lead to the false culpability of anyone regarded under the label of “Islam”.",https://medium.com/abstract-magazine/it-s-time-to-stop-generalising-religious-beliefs-fd16ec775131,['Abstract Magazine'],2015-12-06 18:01:50.761000+00:00,"['Politics', 'Islam', 'Religion']"
Empathy & Antisocial Media,"It looks like Reddit’s solution to their trolling problem is going to be all stick and no carrot. “More powerful tools for mods” are on their way, meant to back up some new language in the terms of service. If you’re wondering how this is different from every other failed attempt to reign in the internet of hate, I’m right there with you. Moderation isn’t the right shovel to move this mountain of bullshit.

Notice I’m not arguing “Freedom of Speech” blah blah blah. I’m all for censoring racist, sexist, hateful speech. The marketplace of ideas doesn’t benefit from it. The electorate isn’t improved by it. They’re just toxic memes.

No, my objection is that top-down censorship isn’t an effective means of policing a content community. It’s slow to take effect, inconsistently applied, and can actually increase unwanted behavior in the short term. (But don’t take my word for it.)

If we really want more open, welcoming, and pro-social online communities, we have to understand the psychology of antisocial behavior.

In-Group Favoritism

Social psychologist Bernard Guerin spent a decade studying the underlying causes of antisocial behavior in groups. It all boils down to an equation that should look real familiar to anyone who uses the internet…

anonymity + group identity = antisocial behavior

In his experiments, group identification acted as an amplifier for individual behavior. When put into groups, people tended to act more antisocial than anonymous individuals acting alone. The reason has a lot to do with in-group favoritism, or very tribal tendency to treat “our people” better than “those people.”

Moderation isn’t the right shovel to move this mountain of bullshit.

In the 1970s, social psychologists found they could induce this dickitry with basically nothing at all. People sorted into groups based on eye color would do it. So would people put into groups based on randomly assigned, and totally meaningless, test scores. Tribalism seems to be hardwired into our brains.

The internet makes things worse by putting a nice, faceless buffer between ourselves and other people. We may be posting in public, but it’s all too easy to imagine we’re just talking to our peers. Our confidantes. Our fellow hate-mongering shitbags.

Anyway, the combination of the two is toxic, but there’s good news. Group identification isn’t inherently bad. When combined with accountability to members of the out-group, it amplifies pro-social behavior, too.

Out-Group Accountability

In one experiment, participants allocated “money” (meaningless tokens) to other participants. They never met these other participants and had no reason to believe that biased allocations would be reciprocated (because they never received tokens as part of the experiment). Yet, even when their group assignments were arbitrary, people still allocated more tokens to their in-group members.

They shorted people for essentially no reason. Hell is other people.

However, simply telling participants that their decisions would be recorded and reviewed by members of the out-group all but eliminated biased behavior. Sometimes, it really is that easy.

We have to understand the psychology of antisocial behavior.

The Player Behavior team at League of Legends has been doing some really groundbreaking work with player tribunals and automated language analysis that has dramatically reduced racist, sexist, and homophobic content in their games. Theirs would be a great example for Reddit to follow.

But what if empathy was baked right in to the way we use social software?

What if, when you visited a subreddit, the first thing you saw was a visualization of the words that most characterize its content? In Dataclysm, Christian Rudder — co-founder of OKcupid — performs just this kind of analysis on thousands of dating profiles. (The results are interesting. For example, liking MST3k seems to be prototypically white and male.)

A feature like this would hold contributors publicly accountable for their language. Even if that wasn’t enough to moderate their behavior, it would still help visitors assess a subreddit’s character better than a “NSFW” warning.

What if members of unassociated subreddits were periodically invited to audit each other? (Two subreddits’ degree of association could be calculated with a cluster analysis. People do it all the time for Twitter.) They wouldn’t be asked to crash each other’s parties, but read through a random sample of comments and provide qualitative feedback. Just knowing that this is a thing that happens would create an environment of out-group accountability.

My Advice to Reddit

It’s not that online communities are inherently unruly. It’s that we design them in ways that promote bad behavior by combining anonymity with group identification.

If we want our communities to be more open, welcoming, and productive places, we need to start…

Tracking unwanted behaviors. Making those metrics publicly visible. Providing victims with better channels of communication.

Top-down moderation isn’t the answer. Neither is eliminating anonymity. If we can make users more accountable to members of their out-groups, our hardwired tribalism could actually drive more pro-social behavior than we’ve ever seen before.

We tried not feeding the trolls. We tried slapping them across the face. Let’s try tapping them on the shoulder and reminding them they’re human.

Support Driven Development,"“I’ve learned more about our product and our customers in the last two days, than I did the entire last year” — me, back in 2009 after doing customer support for two days.

I keep reading in blog posts that very few companies actually know their customers extremely well.

The only reason I did customer support for two days, was because our dedicated support person called in sick and there was no one else to do it. I wasn’t the founder or anything, just a frontend developer.

It very quickly occurred to me that the feeling of our product actually working was an illusion we were stuck in on the inside. We knew our way around the product so we did things just right and just as expected every single time.

We had testers, but they make sure the implementation works, they don’t question if the implementation aligns with the goals of our customers.

It was clear to me that many of the challenges our customers faced would be relatively simple to solve, we just didn’t know about them. At least the engineering team didn’t know about them.

We were shielded.

I remember my early days at the startup as very chaotic. We once had an ongoing issue that restarted the web app at random times, several times a day. Our support guy phones us up and yelled “it just happened again”, and smack down the phone to hang up.

It was unfiltered. We knew something was wrong, and we were working our ass off to find and resolve the issue.

I was regularly called upon by our lead designer to have a look at what I made and was told “I don’t get it. I don’t understand. Where do I begin?”. He wasn’t rude, but he was clear. It was uncomfortable, but it made me feel alive. I was learning.

What had caused this unfiltered feedback to suddenly disappear? I know it wasn’t our customers. Of course they still complained, but something must have changed within the company that caused this feedback to drop dead.

After a (of that time) rather large funding round, the new investors required to hiring of a so called “professional CEO”, one with previous #bigco experience.

That quickly lead to new hiring to the senior management team which aligned with how big companies were structured. We wanted to act big, even on the inside.

It caused the company to be very divided. 25 people, and 5 departments the engineering team being the largest.

At big companies, they do a lot to protect their employees and make a safe and secure environment for them to work. That’s fine if you’re a big company.

But for a pre-profit small company with a product that wasn’t really working as expected, let alone aligned with customer’s need? Toxic!

Instead of giving me and the other engineers unfiltered feedback, the support people solved the customers’ problem by doing it for them. “Send me the files, and I’ll upload them and publish the campaign”.

We thought the product was working, but it was our support staff who was working for our customers.

So much for a safe and secure environment — it was nice to work there, but it sure didn’t result in a great product.",https://medium.com/product-hacking/support-driven-development-c5383d510f01,['Martin H. Normark'],2015-09-29 22:20:20.289000+00:00,"['Support', 'Design', 'Product Development']"
Paul McCartney Can’t Either,"My secret led me quietly down a narrow and winding path, and gave me that feeling you get when you finally arrive at your destination, yet have no idea how you got there. Like when I used to fall asleep in the back seat of my parent’s god-awful minivan during our long road trips. We’d always stop in New Jersey, but to me, it might as well have been the middle of the desert, because I had no idea how I’d arrived there.

Yes. A desert. My secret was much like finding yourself in the middle of a desert. I kept my eyes shut for as long as I could, so that I didn’t have to confront reality and realize that I was dehydrated, burning, and slowly shriveling away. As long as I kept my eyes closed, I would be all right, because ignorance is bliss and New Jersey isn’t as bad as you think it is, especially if you pretend it’s somewhere else.

I got really used to those long road trips growing up. On my sixteenth birthday, when I started touring with a full band, I was comfortable with driving for hours upon hours. I stepped into the life of a musician and never looked back.

Every once in a while, someone would ask about it. My secret. My bandmates knew and pressured me, trying to tell me that it didn’t matter. That it wasn’t that big of a deal. I even tried to get through it, to push past it. But it gripped me, and hung over me like a grimy shadow, stuck to the bottom of my shoes.

Any time someone asked me about it, my bandmates covered for me. They said all kinds of things to slip the truth aside. As soon as we were in private, they trickled out a list of reasons why I shouldn’t try to hide it any more.

There were lots of other people who faced my incapacities, they tried to tell me. But that didn’t change my mind.

We spent years touring across the country, making criss-crosses and zig-zags across the nation, like the connect-the-dots pages in children’s books that my parents gave me during our endless travels.

On our final show of the tour, we played in an overcrowded bar in L.A. I’d been to my fair share of full houses and jam-packed venues, but this was inhumane. After our set, we scrambled behind stage to breathe, but the venue manager ushered us back out. The mass of fans swarmed closer and chanted with enthusiasm.

I started to wonder how the hell I’d gotten this far with such a vital weakness, a glaring incapacity. A gnawing fear rose in me whenever it had a chance of being exposed. Too often I tried to reassure myself that it was superficial, that it didn’t matter. But my reassurance always failed.

The venue manager handed each of us a sheet of music with notes and chords scribbled all over it, displaying our final assigned performance. The crowd’s screams of anticipation merged into an ethereal mesh of excitement and noise that sounded like traffic on the Jersey Turnpike. Deep in the pit of my stomach, that aching feeling of awaking in the back seat of a minivan in New Jersey arose in me.

How the hell did I get this far?

I stared in shame at the sheet of music. The venue manager looked at me.

“Alright, man! Let’s rock it!”

I looked up at him, through the sweat of the aftermath of rock and roll, and whispered. I shut my eyes, kept them closed, and said:

“I can’t read music.”",https://medium.com/a-story-each-day/paul-mccartney-can-t-either-5fe72ddca81d,['A Story Each Day'],2015-10-29 04:37:35.096000+00:00,"['Short Story', 'Fiction', 'A Story Each Day']"
Episode 1: There's a light that never goes out,"It was very late at night and there was not a living soul outside. That street was too strange and so far no one knew why the big house on the corner lived empty, though always with the lights on.

Every night was the same. And that car was already stopped by there were more than six months. It was too long. And no one came to remove, even the police making frequent rounds there.

Some claim to have seen the vehicle wandering the neighborhood, without a driver, slowly, wrapped in smoke. Something very likely, I would say, given the mysteries involving one home.

Was heard always a very strange noise coming up from it whenever the fog was in charge of the neighborhood. And last night, the fog was there again.

The next door neighbor, who lived in the lower house, no longer stand it any longer the situation. Not because of the fog and the car seemed to already be part of the sidewalk. Simply because those sounds were very strange.

It was almost surreal. Even elusive. Sounds arose when the fog came. It was then that he decided to run away. He lived alone, but strangely was careful to shutdown all the lights.

He went screaming down the street, desperate, going straight for the lighted house and the car seemed to have life without any idea where he was going. Without a paddle.

And since then, no one ever heard of Andy Taylor again.

Updated: Black Lives Matter means Black trans women victims and leaders too,"Updated: Black Lives Matter means Black trans women victims and leaders too

Penny Proud is one of the latest reported Black trans woman to be murdered in the U.S. She was shot to death on Tuesday, Feb. 10 in New Orleans.

Penny Proud, 21, became the fifth Black transgender woman murdered in the U.S. earlier this year, sparking outrage. People took to social media to express their frustration using popular hashtags like #BlackTransLivesMatter and #MakePennyProud.

Proud was found dead Tuesday, Feb. 10 in New Orleans with multiple gunshot wounds, receiving little mainstream attention.

“If you know a trans woman of color, lift her up and hold her close. We are being murdered in the streets simply for breathing,” Lourdes Ashley Hunter, 39, national director of Trans Women of Color Collective, tweeted.

According to advocates, Black Lives Matter and coverage around it shouldn’t only focus on the victimization of Black men by police; it should be supportive of Black trans women lives. Hunter said Black trans women and Black Lives Matter are working together in leading Black liberation.

“I think the biggest challenge is making this movement intersectional; looking at the various forms of oppression that play into Blackness,” said Arielle Newton, 23, the editor-in-chief and founder of Blackmillennials.com.

“Black Lives Matter must mean just that, all Black lives, not just [heterosexual] Black men,” said Zellie Imani, 30, activist and blogger of Black-culture.com.

Newton and Imani are cisgender advocates (meaning they identify with the gender they were assigned at birth). They are part of the Black Lives Matter Movement.

“I think there’s a lot of relationships that need to be built,” Newton said. “As a cisgender woman I will never understand what it means to be trans.”

“I actively research for myself and read for myself,” she added. “So I can be better educated and better prepared to be a better ally for my trans brothers and sisters.”

She said she knows “plenty of cisgender people who are like ‘this is a movement for Black liberation.’ Black and Brown trans people of color definitely have a right and place in it.”

Imani blamed transphobia, misgendering, dehumanization and calling Black trans women “it” as major reasons for the lack of value for their lives.

“When a trans woman gets killed, instead of treating her as a victim and wanting to serve the murder of her crime and punish the person who killed her, it’s always about what did she do to get killed?” said Imani.

Ashley Love (center), journalist and coordinator of Black Trans Women’s Lives Matter, organized a national call of peace for Black trans women in D.C. outside the Congressional Black Caucus Conference on Sept. 27. In April 2015, she celebrated her 35th birthday. According to Alternet.org, “the average life expectancy for a black transgender woman is 35 years.”

Ashley Love, 35, journalist and coordinator of Black Trans Women’s Lives Matter, said all Black lives matter, but Black leaders condone transphobic gender segregation, inciting physical violence. She said laws and attitudes that treat trans women as second-class women and subhuman need to be changed.

“Black elected officials and public figures are quick to speak out against White male on Black male violence, yet generally hold their tongues when Black men continuously murder Black women of transsexual history,” said Love, who is a transsexual and intersex advocate.

She asked for support of Black trans women back in a September 2014 press release. “Are the murders of our trans sisters less worthy of tears, of outrage — their humanity less than?”

“All too often the media ignores or belittles the epidemic of violence against Black women in the United States, even more so when the victims are women of transsexual or transgender experience,” Love added.

Lamia Beard, Michelle (Yazmin) Vash Payne (top right) and Ty Underwood (bottom right) are three of the Black trans women murdered earlier this year.

According to the Anti-Violence Project, Lamia Beard was found shot to death on Jan. 17 in Norfolk, Va.; Ty Underwood was found shot to death on Jan. 26 in Texas; and Michelle (Yazmin) Vash Payne was stabbed to death in Los Angeles on Jan. 31.

Lourdes Ashley Hunter, national director of Trans Women Color Collective, gave Goddess Edwards (photographed) her nickname after being misgendered in WHAS 11’s Jan. 12 coverage of her death in Louisville, Ky.

Local news station WHAS 11 reported that 20-year-old Sherman Edwards was found shot to death on Jan. 9 in Louisville, Ky.; Hunter nicknamed her Goddess. Hunter claimed the media misgendered her, speaking in terms of the name she was born with and gender she was assigned, instead of the woman she was when she was killed. Besides WHAS 11, Edwards received little coverage.

Patrisse Cullors, 31, co-founder of #BlackLivesMatter, said the movement is already more supportive of all Black lives, but news coverage focuses on Black male lives.

“I do think that the media covers what they want to cover. [With] the media, the issue of Black men dying is still more important than the issues of Black women and Black trans women.”

“We have been working with TWOCC,” said Cullors. “They have been really critical in the conversation around Black trans women and developing a broader narrative that doesn’t just talk about cis Black people.”

Hunter clarified Black trans women are leading social justice movements in collaboration with cis Black leaders against structural oppression.

“It is critical to note that trans women of color have been the catalysts of social justice movements,” said Hunter. “TWOCC leads a transformative movement that goes beyond inclusion to elevating opportunities of collaboration and collective liberation.”

A Preposterous Corbynian Future Would Nationalise Our Homes,"Three months ago it was preposterous to think that the Labour party membership would be so antagonistic as to elect a man to its leadership that would swerve them so far to the left that it would make Michael Foot look like one of Nigel Farage’s drinking buddies.

But happen, it has. And now that Corbyn is at the head of the second biggest political party in Westminster with an albeit vague shout for the top job in the land in 2020, what could this mean for the UK property market?

A Corbynian future would certainly see our energy companies, communications firms and transport returned to public ownership. He’s made that back-to-the-future pledge already. The rail companies, electric and gas conveyers would be swiftly consigned to mere articles in business text books and we would ‘look forward’ to British Rail, British Gas and perhaps even British Leyland, being resurrected from the nationalised dead. Ministers would be compelled to be chauffeured around in a 2021 model Austin Princess and would always be late for photo-calls because they’d broken down on the way. Same if they took the train really.

This got me thinking about other matters literally even closer to home. With his apparent penchant for all things communistic, could Jeremy Corbyn as PM also move to nationalise our homes? After all, JC’s posthumous mate Mr Karl Marx once didn’t say something along the lines of ‘All property is theft’ but if he’d thought of it at the time, apparently he would have done.

Property ownership in the UK is a fundamentally ideological, aspirational thing. Buy a home and raise a family in it, yes, but it’s also equally about making a profit too. That’s simply what we do here. As my estate agent (biased) Grandfather used to say, ‘Safe as houses, boy’.

On the basis of socialism being the enemy of aspiration (isn’t that what such a standpoint argues for?) surely it follows that a Corbyn Government would ‘ban’ property ownership and would take our homes and reallocate them on the basis of ‘need’. So in other words, that family of 18 from Lincoln that’s been on benefits for years but has a requirement for multiple bedrooms and a decent garden, would be shipped in to Windsor Castle pronto and her Majesty and Phil sent up the A1 to live in their 3 bed semi?

Now, I don’t want to give Comrade Corbyn any ideas, but today’s political disappearance along that sharp left turn in the electoral road (surely) may well lead to things almost as preposterous.

Thankfully, whilst I believe that Jeremy Corbyn’s election will be great for the cut and thrust of British politics, I suspect today will mark the last election he will ever win.",https://medium.com/business-startup-development-and-more/a-preposterous-corbynian-future-would-nationalise-our-homes-751d751c3262,['Russell Quirk'],2015-09-12 16:36:59.841000+00:00,"['Jeremy Corbyn', 'UK Politics', 'Property']"
Don’t Be a Dunce!,"“Don’t Be a Dunce!, (c)Chamomile Tea Party, Jeff Gates, Some Rights Reserved.

I don’t know what to say about the rest of you who actually do believe the promises our candidates make. Washington Post opinion writer, Dana Milbank, illuminates.

The realities of running for office are very different than the realities of being in office (except when they overlap). It’s not just you and your handlers making the decisions. Others are involved. And those others have their handlers, their bases, their strategies, and their aspirations. The problem: most of us don’t believe much of what they say. The answer: start telling the truth.

Thin Gloves,"Please be aware that this story contains harsh language and some violence.

The drill bit slipped and dove into Joey’s hand. He screamed as an eruption of blood sprung from the mangled flesh. He grabbed his hand and cringed, and looked around for help.

He turned toward the rest of the work site. It was a large site — dozens of contractors and construction workers, all grinding the hours of the day to a fine shred. He yelled again. But no one answered. They’d all gone to lunch, or something.

He turned back to his hand and his eyes scanned for something that could delay the bleeding.

“Why didn’t you have thicker gloves, Joey? Hm?”

Joey turned.

“Paxton! Help me out, I — ”

“I see that. Why didn’t you have thicker gloves?”

“I…”

Paxton’s words wove the beginning of a twisted conversation that only a Site Manager could produce. Joey felt his hand grow numb. A pool of blood collected on the plywood below him. It dripped onto his boots.

“Why, Joey? Can you tell me why?”

“Damn. No. Paxton, help me!”

“Thick gloves. Not that hard. Why didn’t you have them?”

“Because. Damn it, Paxton, why can’t you get something to help?”

“Why didn’t you get thicker gloves?”

Blood soaked the plywood flooring.

“It doesn’t matter! Just get something to help me, damn it!”

Paxton leapt forward and violently grabbed Joey’s hand. He twisted together a tourniquet with scrap cloth and rubber bands, until the bleeding started to subside. Joey whimpered in pain. Their eyes met.

“Why didn’t you wear thicker gloves, Joey?”

Joey didn’t answer. His pain grew into fear.

“I… I don’t know.”

“Do you want to know why?”

“Yes.”

Paxton smiled, grabbed Joey’s two shoulders, and sent a creeping chill down Joey’s nerves as he stared him in the eyes.

“Maybe you weren’t wearing a thicker pair of gloves because your father learned from his father to always buy the thin ones. And his father bought the thin gloves because he had bad circulation, and wasn’t meant to be a construction worker in the first place. But of course, he took up all that fucking construction work because that was what everyone was doing in the 50’s, weren’t they?”

Shock began to set in, and Joey shook and quivered. But Paxton ignored him.

“Your father had bad circulation in his hands, didn’t he? Yes, he did.”

Paxton looked up. The rest of the workers started toward the site, finished with lunch. Paxton turned back to Joey.

“And now, all because of some government construction policy in the 40’s, you’ll have bad circulation in your hands, too.”

He turned and walked away. Before he stepped out of the framing, he turned back and yelled:

Frankly Speaking: How I Learned to be Heard,"Rule #13 Tell A Tale

Share a personal story with emotional appeal

“The universe is made of stories, not of atoms.” — Muriel Rukeyser

According to West Wing Writers, a speechwriting and communications strategy firm in D.C., 63 percent of people recall stories a speaker tells, yet only 5 percent can remember a single statistic — even when the speech includes vastly more statistics than stories.

Since I work in a news company, I often share my personal story to tell people why I am passionate about the industry. The story goes like this: my Italian father was on a train in Paris when he noticed a group of soldiers bothering a Portuguese woman as she was trying to read a newspaper. He approached the soldiers, telling them to leave the woman alone. Then he wrote his phone number on the front page of the woman’s paper, saying, “If you are ever in Rome, give me a call and I’ll show you around.” One year later he received a call from the woman on the train, who was visiting Italy with a friend. She had kept the paper. That was the beginning of my parents’ relationship — and why I can say that newspapers are in my DNA.

THE TAKEAWAY: Tell a story about yourself that evokes emotions. If you come from humble beginnings, tell people how you got from point A to point B to achieve your passion. Selectively shape your narrative so that it’s one people remember.

Rule#14 The Rule Of Three

Build arguments around three facts

“The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.” — Hans Hofmann

Most studies agree that the average person remembers between 25 and 50 percent of what he or she hears. That means that when you talk to your boss, your colleagues or customers, they are likely to retain less than half of the conversation.

So how do you make sure you get your point across? Entrepreneur and former McKinsey consultant Ameer Ranadive believes the rule of three is what persuades his clients to take action. Ranadive writes, “1. Your argument gets their attention and is memorable, 2. You are forced to choose the three most important reasons, 3. You sound more structured, confident and decisive when you speak.”

I use Ranadive’s rule of three at work and in my everyday life, so much so that I have developed a reputation among my friends for having an interesting opinion about everything. When they ask, “What do you think about X?” I always answer, “Well, I can tell you three things about X…” I do this even when I don’t know much about whatever X happens to be, but since my ideas are well-structured, they sound smart. Now that my secret is out, use it to your advantage.

THE TAKEAWAY: Any answer, argument or presentation should be built around three facts. Do this and you sound informed but still keep things brief. And don’t underestimate the little things — for example, when sending a report in attachment, summarize the most important information first.

Rule #15 Shut Up

Resist the urge to interject yourself

“Honey, once you’ve made the sale, stop selling.” — Marshall Eriksen of How I Met Your Mother

In a study on task switching and interruptions, researchers for Microsoft Corporation recorded the activities of information workers. They found that participants were interrupted four times per hour on average. Not unexpected, right? But get this: 40 percent of the time the interrupted individuals did not resume the task they were working on before they were disturbed. In fact, critical long-term projects were even more difficult for the workers to return to.

I learned this the hard way. At the beginning of my career I felt the need to interject myself into discussions to prove I had something to offer. When I joined a team working on a proposal due the following week, however, I quickly noticed a change in the behavior of my peers in response to my constant editorials, as the initially welcoming atmosphere devolved to a high-pressure environment. At first I thought I wasn’t contributing enough, so I jumped in even more frequently than before. We missed our deadline — and I later understood it was my fault.

THE TAKEAWAY: In western culture, people have the tendency to fill up quiet space with unnecessary chatter. Resist that urge. Be patient, and when you have almost convinced someone your way is best, say little, or else you risk that person changing his or her mind. If a meeting is wrapping up on a positive note, save your questions for later. And if someone is working on a challenging task, don’t interrupt him or her. Knowing when to shut up increases your productivity and your co-workers’.

Rule #16 No Trash Talk

Respect your co-workers

“Promote what you love instead of bashing what you hate” — Ron Oliver

A close friend of mine was very popular in college, wowing faculty and students with his academic and athletic performance. Unfortunately, he also excelled at criticizing people.

Before graduation, my friend applied to his dream job at a top marketing firm. He was the ideal candidate. He aced the interview. But the company turned him down. Shocked, he later discovered that other recent hires knew about his reputation as a sidewalk superintendent and advised the hiring manager to choose a different candidate.

A team of psychologists from the United States and New Zealand found an occurrence called “spontaneous trait transference”. Individuals take on the personality traits that they use to describe others. If you tell your friend, that someone you both know is selfish and self-centered, she will unconsciously associate you with those two negative characteristics. The worst part is that such associations persist over time!

THE TAKEAWAY: My friend learned the hard way that criticizing others is a sign of a lack of self-awareness. Show respect to your co-workers and be straightforward with them when you notice a problem.

Rule #17 Mine The Nugget

Find the unexpected side of the story

“You see things; and you say ‘why?’But I dream of things that never were, and I say Why not?’” — George Bernard Shaw

Since it was launched in September 2012, digital news website Quartz has achieved immense growth, reaching millions of social media users. How? By extracting the “golden nugget,” the most unusual or unexpected side of the story. For example, a story on pollution and mislabeling in the tuna industry gets compressed into the headline, “59 percent of America’s ‘tuna’ isn’t actually tuna.” That sums up the real meat of the story, so to speak.

When I first started working for a news company, the reports I sent to my supervisor, a former business journalist, often came back to me with the question, “What’s the story?” The story (aka the nugget) was always buried at the end of my write-up. This is why my work was not getting noticed, my supervisor told me. People were not interested in making the commitment to read what I wrote unless I engaged them right off the bat. Once I began mining the nugget, I finally received the recognition I had been waiting for.

THE TAKEAWAY: Always look for the most interesting angle. When you send links to colleagues, summarize the report with the most surprising or fascinating tidbit — the golden nugget. You save your coworkers’ time and glean a conversation starter in turn.

Rule #18 Know Your Stuff

Prepare for success

“To be prepared is half the victory” — Miguel Cervantes

A descendant of working class immigrants, Al Smith grew up in the early 1900s in the Lower East Side of New York City. Despite his humble beginnings, Smith was interested in politics, a profession usually reserved for the well-off. But Smith defied the odds and became a junior member of the New York State Assembly at 31.

At nights, while politicians from aristocratic backgrounds attended parties and social events, Smith would read every single piece of legislation he could find. Eventually, senior leaders of the party noticed his preparedness and made Smith their trusted advisor. Smith went on to be elected Governor of New York four times.

In 2012, I was asked to give a TEDx talk regarding a small book I had published on innovation. I had always been terrified of public speaking, and when I received the formal invitation, I gaped at the impressive lineup of speakers. Without a doubt I was the least qualified. I felt crushed under the weight of the names flanking mine on the program: one, a NASA astronaut, and the other, Brad Pitt’s brother Doug, who does charity work in Africa. The pressure was on.

For a month I studied and memorized my talk, preparing contingency plans and pacing my presentation. On the big day, following the astronaut I walked up to the stage, looked at the audience…and to my surprise, I felt entirely relaxed. I was ready for this. I was prepared.

THE TAKEAWAY: The fastest way to confidence is being prepared. Do your homework and read everything about your field or target audience. Knowledge workers such as lawyers, economists, managers, strategists and journalists are all in the business of selling air; your job is to make sure you convince people just how good your air is.

I was saddened by the news that Gigaom was shutting down Tuesday. That said, I can’t claim to have lost my job like Laura Hazard Owen. Re/code and Gigaom have consistently been my two favorite tech news sources.

Nevertheless, like Gregory, I’m part of the problem. Viral media today is a lot like fast food. Fast food has very little nutritional value, makes us fat(ter) and lethargic, but we eat it. Why? It’s appealing, easy and temporarily feels good. We live in the age of fast-food media. An age of “You’ll never believe what happened when Kim…”

I’m honest enough to say, I’ve read all types of WTF. Won’t get too specific but I’ve been known to donate a click when my eyes are stimulated by a GIF, a cool or startling photo, or a context-less “This,” “Important,” or “Whoa!” on Twitter. I consume fast-food media at the troughs where the technorati and journalists are chatting: Twitter and Facebook.

Sorry, Gigaom, you shut down because we’d rather watch this guy dip bread in oil.

Sadly, the platforms where content creators hangout are chock-full of low-quality content which snags my attention.

It’s not reaching to claim that Social Media has been shifting from niche to mass-market content. Existing platforms are focused on broad appeal and the re-share dynamic ensures it. We’re repeatedly fed what people share and people share content with social-proof. It’s science!

With the recent release of Meerkat (which is fun), we continue to move in to a world where every person has the tools to be a self-aggrandizing reality-star. We have real-time updates on Twitter, a personal photo-mag on Instagram, live video on Meerkat, and production content on YouTube.

The First Step is Acceptance

Say it to yourself, “I accept that I am easily distracted by pretty photos and tension creating vague headlines.”

James Nachtwey for TIME

Distraction is the only thing that consoles us for miseries and yet it is itself the greatest of our miseries. — Blaise Pascal

Platforms are becoming more visual, quicker, and focusing on shorter and shorter content. Medium (this website), recently left its long-form roots to embrace random thoughts and link-sharing.

Find success in Social Media by following the three-P’s: preach, polarize, and pander.

Twitter has evolved to be more vibrant visually. Constructing a great Tweet is no longer a simple text message. Barriers keep rising, distribution doesn’t scale, and cross-fit badass and Twitter CEO, Dick, says it’s cool if you don’t post anymore. Meanwhile, behind the blue walls, Facebook continues to reduce clickbait by focusing on time-spent on external links, publishers are realizing that they need to be more and more creative to grab people’s attention. Incredibly, both Facebook and Twitter are increasing the cost for both content creation and distribution to be successful. Moreover, they’re requiring contributors to post more content to surf trends and maintain relevance. Basically, they’re expecting users and brands to make a full-time commitment to their platforms to be successful.

Can Sharing Ideas Be Simpler?

The two questions we should all ask ourselves:

Why do I need a captive following?

How often do I actually need to speak to a large audience?

If you’re a media company, your answers are simple:

Because it’s my core business

All day, every day

For the rest of us, including most product companies, we may need an audience for major personal updates (#humblebrags), news that impacts the community, milestones, a crazy epiphany, or a launch (see ProductHunt). Meanwhile, the community could come together to discuss what’s next and accelerate progress.

Why can’t we work together to build a shared audience rather than competing to own one?

Aside: Help me understand why you need a captive audience and couldn’t be successful in a shared community context?

Thoughtful publishers and content creators should nurture platforms that aren’t engineered to, eventually, kill them. Facebook and Twitter, or, more generally, peer-to-peer networks scale poorly. They always will become plutocratic networks where a relatively small group of entities hold all the distribution power.

The solution and our future is in Community Media platforms.

Four Qualities of Community Media Platforms

We-first vs Me-first — Platforms where the core dynamic is building a following are Me-first platforms. They focus the user on building a following so they may have a voice. Rather then assuming that every person has intrinsic value, each and every person starts from scratch and has to re-build their network. Me-first networks generally have a massive early-adopter bias which stifles the success of users who join late.

We-first networks like HackerNews, Kapuno Communities, Digg (old version), Reddit or ProductHunt focus their users on being helpful to others as a means of building a reputation. Subtle but very important is the fact that the priority in the information architecture (IA) is on the content not the speaker.

‘Vote’ vs Re-Share —A community network’s distribution is built on top of voting algorithms, and may be able to offset for the bias of social on judging the quality of the content. Offsetting bias is key because existing networks provide some huge followings which skews content’s engagement but doesn’t necessarily mean the content is actually “good.” This would mean you’d examine each vote based on the relationship of the voter to the content creator.

Engineered to Drive Interested Audiences to External Sites — Platforms that fail to provide organic (non-paid) distribution to links to external content are essentially expecting producers to grow the platform for free. This is amoral (yes, there is a morality to product design) and an incredibly thoughtless design. Writers and content-creators should bias towards platforms which successfully distribute their quality links and drive interested readers to their properties, subscription lists, and shopping carts.

Day-Zero Distribution Value—Imagine a 14 year old genius was born in to an underprivileged low-income home. The family lacks resources, mentors, and the network on or offline to nurture the child’s curiosity. Against all odds, and with the help of the internet, the child discovers how to build a better battery system. They build a prototype, film a video with their friend’s iPhone, and upload it to their sparse YouTube account. It gets no views. They take the video, create a Twitter account and their first tweet is their discovery.

Would they reach the right scientists and technologists? The day-zero distribution value assumes that a person can join, share with no prior history on the platform, and there is an available audience which has the ability to decide the merits of the content.

A community media platform would provide a space for this young genius to join and share their idea with others who may be able to help them move the idea forward or, simply, promote it on to their own audience.

Yes, Publishers Still Need to ‘Own’ An Audience

Until now, I’ve been talking about trends, the problems with existing platforms and why you should find and engage on community media platforms. However, I realize that publishers still require a predictable audience so they can effectively monetize it. My recommendations don’t hope to say anyone should stop using SM; rather, it’s that there is more value to focusing efforts elsewhere to build for a more sustainable future.

Content creators should continue to build their following on Twitter, Facebook and elsewhere by engaging with large communities outside of their own followings and off their platforms.

On Kapuno, we purposely don’t have following on network. It’s a huge difference between us and most of the others who just follow the status quo and don’t attempt to re-think the impact of creating another peer-to-peer network.

We have a button (pictured above) to follow the member on Twitter on their profiles and anywhere you see their name. Also, as a thanks to our helpful members, we also promote their Twitter account in our community feeds.

Emerging trends in User Experience Design,"1. Leveraging knowledge about the human brain and the human condition

2. Two-way conversation format for a more human experience

3. Engagement loops (habits + a meaningful journey)

1. Leveraging knowledge about the human brain and the human condition

To design delightful product experiences that make life easy, most product designers actively research how relevant people think and behave via exploratory research and usability studies.

But more and more, we are learning the basics of how information is perceived, retained and used by our brain. We are learning about our own cognitive biases as designers and those of our users. We are learning about people’s core needs, how they make choices, how behaviors emerge, why they sometimes don’t act.

2. Two-way conversation format for a more human experience

We intrinsically value the human aspects of our lives. Leveraging this principle, designers are creating more relatable and empathetic products, in contexts where it makes sense. They are learning from guiding principles used by great personal trainers and life coaches.

They are writing out scripts for the conversation a product will have if it were a person before they design screens. Employing this tactic will enrich the interactions a user will have with future products.

The goal of designing is one of the following:

persuade to act educate impart happiness simplify a task take less time to do a task

In the first 4 situations, a product’s impact can be improved, by having a more human conversation that resonates with the user.

Hana Schank’s thoughts in this article are quite noteworthy on this topic-

UX Design as a Two-Way Conversation

3. Engagement loops (habits + a meaningful journey)

Users engage with most products in ways that evolve over time. What motivates them to come back every day might be different from what keeps them coming back for weeks and months.

Why I Plan On Watching ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ Dumb,"“We’re not in the information age anymore, we are in the information management age.” — Chris Hardwick

There are two major pros and cons to living in the information age:

Pro

Access and exposure to mountains of constant information.

Con

Access and exposure to mountains of constant information.

This is especially evident when it comes to the deluge of spoilers published online regarding forthcoming Hollywood movies.

Movies like the highly anticipated Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

Despite director J.J. Abram’s shroud of secrecy covering the production, speculation has been at a feverish pitch concerning every minute detail of the film.

Disney and Lucasfilm recently added kerosene to this raging inferno by unleashing their powerful marketing machine to heighten the already frenzied demand for Star Wars merchandise.

While it is exciting to discover more about a film you are are eagerly awaiting, the unfortunate trade-off is there are very little surprises left to experience during a movie’s initial theatrical exhibition.

For me, a huge part of the appeal of watching a movie for the first time theatrically is the sense of discovery. The feeling of embarking on an unknown journey when those opening credits blaze across the screen.

Sadly, I feel this dynamic, communal component of the cinematic experience is going the way of the dodo bird.

This is why I decided to go on a media blackout when it comes to all things related to Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

I’ve made Herculean efforts to skip movie spoilers posted online. I’ve avoided toy aisles in department stores and at big box retailers like the plague.

When conversations about the movie turn to in-depth details, I politely excuse myself, because I want to go see the movie being as ignorant as I possibly can be about its plot.

Despite my efforts, I’ve still gotten some information about specific details because I run a sci-fi web site, and have a social media presence that makes complete spoiler avoidance all but impossible.

Fortunately, I have managed to avoid most major film details, spoilers, and plot leaks. This pleases me, because I want to turn back the clock when I attend my first The Force Awakens screening, and hear the stirring opening notes to John Williams’ transcendent score.

I want to travel back in time to when I saw the original trilogy in theaters as a teenager— a time before smartphones, the internet, and social media.

A time when I initially learned Darth Vader’s true identity while sitting in the theater watching The Empire Strikes Back. I’ll never forget the audience’s gasps of shock and surprise.

I think mine might have been among the loudest.

Yes, the temptation to consume all the information about upcoming films— especially ones we are most excited for — is almost irresistible.

But if we can show some restraint, allow ourselves to limit how much we are spoiled about movies like The Force Awakens, I believe we can enjoy richer, more satisfying cinematic experiences.

Saiku 3.1.1 EE is released,"So its been a while, and a lot of hard work, changing of minds and late nights, but Saiku 3.1.1 EE has been released.

This release has the usual tweaks and changes from our CE product, including fixes to the PDF export, performance improvements, enhanced webdav support, parameter population from the URL and more but it also has two large improvements over our last EE release.

Firstly we have much improved MongoDB support. More logic is pushed down to MongoDB to improve performance whilst still retaining the caching properties that make Mondrian lightning quick over repeated queries.

Mapping Mongo fields to table columns is carried out through our web interface and once you save the schema to Saiku you can then use it to connect to your data source.

Secondly, we have shipped a beta release of our Saiku Schema Designer, the only Mondrian 4 specific schema designer on the market. This is a first release and it is missing a few bits and pieces, but its very functional and allows users to quickly and easily create Mondrian 4 schema without knowing how to write code. We understand that the switch from Mondrian 3 to Mondrian 4 can be a bit of a headache as so much has changed, but we want to make life as easy as possible, so the Saiku Schema Designer allows you to create your schema without touching a text editor. Whats more is once you have designed your schema you can then export it to an XML file so you can manually inspect it or edit it further. This feature is beta so if you hit bugs please file a report.

Documentation is available at http://wiki.meteorite.bi and we shall be rolling out some tutorial videos over the next few days so stay tuned.

Lastly what is great about combining these two new features is finally you can use Saiku end to end without using a text editor(unless you really want to). Mongo users can now create their mapping data source and a Mondrian schema all from within the user interface, which is a great step forward for the Saiku platform. We will be doing further releases over the next few months to improve our Mongo and Schema support still further and introduce our new Dashboard designer. But in the mean time, go grab a copy of Saiku 3.1.1 EE from the portal and take it for a spin!",https://medium.com/innovative-business-intelligence/saiku-3-1-1-ee-is-released-24b2bba2b84e,['Meteorite Bi'],2015-04-28 21:58:53.894000+00:00,"['Mongodb', 'Mondrian', 'Business Intelligence']"
Should we surrender?,"“Your identity may be assaulted, vandalised and brutally ridiculed, but it can never be snatched away unless surrendered.”

You are an honourable servant of Allah. You are a part of a favoured nation. Your role models are the likes of Khadijah, Aisha, Amina, Maryam, Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali and so many more. You were consistently in the du’as of a devoted man called Muhammad (ﷺ). It is you that is being addressed in the Book of Allah, it is you that has an eternal home waiting for you in the heavens, and it is you that has been promised to be victorious. O Mu’min — don’t you see that you are special? Everything can be ripped out of your hands, but the one thing that can never disappear, is your Islam. This, is locked and sealed in your heart, surrounded by the sweetness of imaan and the light of taqwa and sabr, so much so, it cannot be diminished, because it is Haqq, it is pure and it is true.

I ask you, is being called an Isis witch the truth?

Is being threatened to have pig parts shoved down your throat a part of the truth?

Is kicking a pregnant woman in the stomach, the truth?

Is being robbed in your own home, having your Qur’an torn to pieces in front of you, or having your hijab/niqab pulled from your head, or being subjected to continuous abuse and violence

– is any of this truth?

The truth is, Muslims are increasingly being attacked under the umbrella “The war on Terror”. Normal people just like you and I, feel compelled to externalise their corrupt and distorted thoughts with actions that can have an enormous impact with unalterable consequences. There is unity and uproar when these incidents occur; anger flourishes across the nation when these attacks go viral, sadness and disgust is felt in every Muslims chest — and yet, the real attack, the attack that has been left on the victims mind is not given even half of the attention the external attack receives. Is it because this victim is not screaming in public all over YouTube –

“I’M REALLY ANXIOUS ABOUT STEPPING OUTSIDE” “I’M FEELING SO UNBEARABLY LOW BECAUSE I’VE BEEN TREATED THIS WAY” “WHY CAN NO ONE NOTICE I’M STRUGGLING WITH INTENSE PARANOIA?”

Is that what it will take?

It seems that mental health has once again been pushed to the side in these circumstances, where in actual fact it is vital. Many published pieces show a strong correlation between racism / discrimination and negative mental health, and most commonly found anxiety, PTSD, and forms of depression, can be the result of experiencing a racially motivated attack. However, there are many other symptoms that can appear, such as, hallucinations, paranoia, questions of self-worth, isolating oneself from society, self-harming and sometimes if the abuse is consistent, it can lead to suicide. Everyone has different response systems, so although one person may be able to deal with it positively — others are not the same. Everyone has a different experience,and everyone has different mindset, sometimes it is as bad as they think.

Why is it that we give so much attention to an attack that lasts a few minutes, and yet we ignore sometimes the lifelong effects of that very attack we hyped over?

Victims are often told “you will be rewarded In Shaa Allah” and “MashAllah, you’re so brave” — which is true, but do you ever stop and genuinely ask if that person is okay? Do you ever give them your time to say “do you want to talk about what happened? If not right now, it’s okay. You can take your time.” People often feel trapped and feel like they have to put on a brave face, because who can feel sad about being rewarded, right? Wrong. Just because we know that rewards are waiting for us, and we know after every hardship there is ease, doesn’t mean we should ignore our feelings of sadness. Otherwise, why would we have companions? What would be the point in seeking Allah’s help? Therefore, it’s okay to want to talk about your experience even whilst knowing that it was a test from Allah and knowing that you will be rewarded, it doesn’t make you any less brave or weak.

Whether it’s bullying, abuse, one comment, one incident or 10 — we have to accept that it’s happening; we have to accept that people’s mental health is affected, and we have to accept that it needs to be cared for. There have been far too many incidents, far too many reports, and far too many cases of mental health illnesses to just simply not face it. There have been far too many hijabs taken off, there have been far too many beards shaved, and there have been far too many Muslim identities stripped — but why are our brothers and sisters surrendering their identities? Could it be because when their identities were assaulted, vandalised and brutally ridiculed, we were never there to help them rebuild it? Be the first one to reach out, be the first to hand that person the first brick of their foundation. Don’t wait until someone becomes depressed, or experiences PTSD, or even becomes suicidal.

Victory is with the hearts that are attached to the Haqq. So no matter how hard it gets to be a Muslim in the west, remember that this life was not meant to be easy, but you were not meant to suffer alone either. This is why if you feel if there is no one in the world there for you, we are here for you. Inspirited Minds is here for you.",https://medium.com/inspirited-minds/should-we-surrender-3d35a93c3517,['Inspirited Minds'],2015-12-06 00:26:46.200000+00:00,"['Islam', 'Suicide', 'Mental Health']"

My Early Years at Eureka

My memories go back to those early years when I first came to Eureka. It started on one of those summer days when the chairman of my department at Western Illinois University said, “There’s a job opening at Eureka, and I think you would be good for this.” So I put on my best white suit and left Macomb. We had just gotten across the railroad tracks when the axle in the car broke. We made a mad dash to the Ford dealership and explained the situation that I had a job interview and had to get there. They put a new axle in the car quicker than you can imagine and we made it to Eureka.

I remember pulling up College Avenue, and there was a whole bunch of African-American students. Not knowing Eureka very well, I thought it was surely an African-American college. It turned out to be students in the Upward Bound Program which was meeting for lunch in the Commons. At any rate, I met with Clarence Noe and Don Littlejohn and we interviewed and they gave me a tour of the campus. I remember meeting Dan Cobb, who was coming back from the tennis courts. A few days later they offered me the job.

The theater at that time was in Burgess, which was far from ideal in terms of audience access. So having been rushed through the interview, I figured out why that was. The theater was a disaster with platforms piled up all around the building. So there I was with a whole bunch of new courses to teach and my first production to direct, which was The Glass Menagerie. There are stories related to that because I had more of a technical background than my predecessor. There was a lot of rebuilding I had to do. One of the important needs was lumber. With the configuration of the stairways in Burgess there was no way to carry 16-foot lengths of lumber up to the third floor. So we tried to figure out how we could get materials up there. We thought we might just build things in the parking lot, but that wouldn’t work. We noticed there was a pulley outside one of the windows on the third floor. We figured we could put a rope through that and hoist the lumber up from the outside. The problem was that we did this during the day time when classes were being held on the first and second floors. So students in the classes could see a rope dangling down by the window. On the ground the students or I would attach it to some lumber to then it would be hauled up. Whoever was in the classroom would see this length of lumber creeping upward to the top floor, where it would be leveraged in. So that’s how we were able to get materials up to the third floor. That was one of the first problems we had.

Once we had the materials, we started building. One of the methods we used was a frame for flats which was held together with plywood plates riveted together with something called a clout nail. We would drive the nail through the wood and it would hit the metal plate and it would bend the tip of the nail back so there would be a very firm connection. So we started building new flats for the production. You put the two pieces of lumber with the plate on top and just started whaling away. So we were building flats, and there were something like twelve or sixteen nails in each corner. There was BAM, BAM, BAM, all this noise. The kids are all excited because they are doing something different.

Suddenly this short guy comes up from the second floor — it was Rudy Eichenberger, who taught math — and he says, “Excuse me, but you’re knocking the ceiling down in the classroom.” We discovered that we were literally knocking the ceiling down in the classroom below when we were hammering on the flats.

The rehearsal process was also fun up there because the attic of the building was inhabited by bats and pigeons, and so some of the students felt that the place was haunted. So we conducted rehearsals for The Glass Menagerie and you could hear this constant noise from the attic. One night we were in there and we could hear this rustling sound, and suddenly a squirrel comes crashing through the ceiling and falls on the set, kind of dazed. Again, the students think the place is haunted, but it’s just a squirrel. He recovers from the fall and just dashed off somewhere, and we never found it. We don’t know where it went or what happened to it. I remember there was access to the attic through old heating channels in the building. You could get up there by climbing this old, shaky wooden ladder that had been nailed to the wall. You could go up there and see this layer of bat and pigeon droppings. And the disturbing thing was they were eating some of the wiring. So that became part of a legend from my early days at Burgess Theater.

Another thing I remember about that first production was there were four large posts in the theater, making it almost impossible to work there. So I finally decided in the first production to incorporate the posts into the set and surround the stage with seats for the audience. That worked pretty well for us too. I would sit in the audience in a director’s desk. Bill Thomas remembers that when I was taking notes I had a light on my desk. I would turn the light off so I could see the lighting during rehearsals. When I would take a note, I would turn the light on. And Bill remembers thinking, “Oh, my God, what did I do wrong?” when he would see my light go on. This was kind of a running joke with us. The Glass Menagerie went well. It was a different kind of a show than my predecessor had been doing — it was a small cast of four people.

Jerry Kline was a reviewer for the Peoria Journal Star. He was a very good reviewer, but I didn’t know what to expect when he came to review the production. And he sat behind one of the posts. My wife Carol remembers that I was in a panic because I was sure that he couldn’t see what was happening on stage. But he wrote a very kind and considerate review of the play. His one criticism was that in the set of the play there was a picture of the absent father. The picture that we had was an old one, possibly one of the founders of Eureka College with his beard; we were hoping that he looked like an old sailor who had left the family. There were very few items on stage. Jerry Kline said he liked the stage but that the picture of the father was representing a person who was just too old. So we took a little bit of offense to that remark, and what we did in the next dozen or so shows was to include that portrait somewhere on the set. I don’t know if Jerry Kline ever caught up with that. It became a running joke with us. If there was a hallway, there was a picture of that man; if there was a library setting his picture was there. That picture became a legend and a tradition in my early years at Eureka College.",https://medium.com/studs-terkel-project/bill-davis-861354f7349f,['Eureka College'],2015-12-16 16:05:44.855000+00:00,"['Short Story', 'Fiction']"
7 Key Lessons from Business Adventures: Bill Gates’s Favorite Business Book,"Forty-three. It’s a little young for an American president and a bit old for a pop idol. As it turns out, however, it’s a great age for a business book.

Since Bill Gates blogged about his admiration for the John Brooks book Business Adventures, it has been reshelved at the top of the Amazon and NYT bestseller lists. Business Adventures isn’t new, but it’s beloved by business tycoons like Gates and Warren Buffet for the evergreen lessons it contains.

Business Adventures details 12 critical moments in American industry, including the rise of Xerox and Piggly Wiggly, the Ford Edsel fiasco, and the GE and Texas Gulf Sulphur scandals. Perhaps above all, Business Adventures teaches lessons about people – how they act, what makes them thrive and flounder, and what devilry they’re likely to get up to if left to their own devices. Business Adventures’ lessons are about human nature in the context of business, and though technologies and best practices change, people never do.

Penned by a long-time New Yorker contributor, one of the main strengths of Business Adventures is its wonderful prose and stories. In his blog, Gates writes:

“Brooks wrote long articles that frame an issue, explore it in depth, introduce a few compelling characters, and show how things went for them… Unlike a lot of today’s business writers, Brooks didn’t boil his work down into pat how-to lessons or simplistic explanations for success.”

We agree that the 12 case studies that comprise Business Adventures resist summary. But if you’re in it for the key lessons from Business Adventures rather than the book’s elegant prose, we’ve rounded up a few for you here.

1. A lesson from the 1962 Flash Crash:

At their core, humans are basically emotional, irrational beings. Over the course of only three days, fear and panic led the stock market to plummet $20 billion only to boomerang back up a day later. Facts are a lot less compelling than the dictates of the lizard brain.

2. A lesson from the Ford Edsel fiasco:

Pay close attention to your market. Customers’ wishes can change very quickly and it’s important to keep a finger on the collective pulse. When Ford wasn’t looking, mid-sized dropped off of their buying radar.

3. A lesson from the federal income tax system:

Sometimes, the best solution is to scrap it. Over the years, the US tax system became so convoluted, corrupt, and loophole laden that it now encourages inefficiency. The only real recourse would be a do-over.

4. A lesson from the Texas Gulf case of 1959:

Just as people are inherently irrational, you can also count on them to be pretty self serving, too. In summary: when Texas Gulf executives found out about mineral-rich ground the company had just struck, they slowly began buying up stock shares and telling their families to follow suit – all the while denying the find to the public. Thus, insider trading laws were born.

5. A lesson from Xerox’s rollercoaster success:

Never trust a rapid success. Nobody expected copy machines to take off when Xerox launched its product in 1959, but by 1964, revenue was so good that the company could afford to drop $4 million to support the UN. By 1965, however, Xerox was in trouble: while they’d been busy philanthropizing, competitors had caught up fast.

6. A lesson from Piggly Wiggly’s investment debacle:

Revenge isn’t actually so sweet – and it certainly doesn’t pay. To teach them a lesson, incensed Piggly Wiggly owner Clarence Saunders sought to buy back all of his stock from tricksy prospectors. What he got instead was near bankruptcy.

7. A lesson from the Bretton Woods Conference of ‘64:

A small group of determined individuals can prevail against a bigger, stronger foe. When a collective of savvy prospectors believed Britain couldn’t keep up the currency exchange rates, they started betting against the pound in the market. Despite odds (and a strong central bank alliance against them) they won.

THE CHILD & THE SERVANT,"Part 12 of 18

Time Stamp: 20:26–22:10

Your Creator has endowed you with His power and will. In addition, He has even sanctioned the fruition of your destiny and you walking in it. Your future requires that you walk in the authority granted unto you. However, there are some pitfalls along the way. You will encounter some setbacks, but none are more deadly than your own, childish thinking. We have previously spoken about this subject, but I want to delve just a bit deeper into it with a scenario.

Imagine being the child of a King that has granted you an immense inheritance. As the next in line to the throne, you are the prince or princess. Supported by the King, your word will move the entire kingdom. The only reason it does not, at this moment, is the fact that your father still sits on the throne. In the meantime, your father has instructed all the teachers, sages, counselors, and learned scholars to teach you the ways of the kingdom you will rule and the world you inhabit.

All of this is wonderful. You are learning from the top minds of your kingdom. You are being prepared to step into the role you were born to occupy. Your inheritance is not only the kingdom, but also the wealth of your father — the King! Though all of this is good and fine, your status as the prince or princess has not changed. Besides your father, the King, you are the ruler of everyone who comes to see you. I really need you to get that.

YOU ARE THE RULER OF EVERYONE WHO COMES TO SEE YOU.

Though you are learning from all these people, you rule over them. Though they are teaching you, you rule over them. Though you obey their instructions, you rule over them. The only thing stopping you from fully realizing your destiny is your age or immaturity! It is your underdeveloped mentality that keeps you from fully walking in the ruling position granted to you by your father!

As it is in this story, so it is with you! Your Creator has granted you an enormous inheritance that will allow you to rule in your destiny. Though you are ruler over all that come your way — understand that this is an analogy; don’t think you rule other people — you are being hindered by the childish processing you have not put away in favor of grasping that which has been left to you.

God charges us to put away harmful, childish ways and perceptions as if we have a choice in the matter…and we do!

Your destiny requires it!

Empower Your Users,"A friend and serial entrepreneur once gave me a piece of advice:

Better to be a plumber than a journalist.

By and large, you’ll build a stronger business doing something for a customer they unpleasant or boring than if the task was inherently exciting or compelling. The trick, then, is to find something you like doing that’s in demand but doesn’t appeal to most people.

I was reminded of this adage when I recently visited the offices of Intuit, makers of TurboTax and QuickBooks. Few of us here in the U.S. want to fill out paperwork for the IRS, and most small business owners don’t set up shop to deal with the books at the end of the month. I’m more than happy to hand that over to Intuit in the same way I’d call a plumber to unclog a drain or replace a toilet; I don’t want to deal with any part of it.

From Drudgery to Delight

Intuit, not afraid to set the bar high, wants customers to have a delightful experience when dealing with their finances. They call this philosophy Design For Delight (D4D for short), and it’s all over their campus.

One of many D4D reminders on the Intuit campus

This isn’t just a slogan, either; you can see how this attitude has made it into their shipping products. TurboTax avoids most data entry by instead having you taking a picture of your W-2 with your smartphone, for example. If I can get my taxes done without even sitting down at a desk, and get back to what I’d rather be doing, well, that’s awesome.

Empowering Workers

There is a flip side, though: to enable the delightful experience I have as a customer, someone needs to deal with my taxes at some point. And by the same token, someone needs to put their boots on and fix the plumbing. So how does that happen? How can we improve that?

I believe this is where another mindset is needed. We need to give sharp knives to badasses.

Credit: sblackley on Flickr

This phrase blends elements of Kathy Sierra’s BADASS: Making Users Awesome and one of Pixar’s senior programmers describing his work as building “sharp knives and crazy tech for storytellers.” The idea is that the users are both experts in their domain and responsible adults who don’t want tools with childproof locks on them.

Yes, he could cut himself. But this ain’t his first rodeo. (Credit: jamesjustin on Flickr)

If this knife isn’t sharp, it is fundamentally useless. With software, the system can’t be so locked down that it prevents a human being with good judgment from taking the correct action. (If it is, they’ll go outside the tool. There’s always a way.) If users can adjust their own workflows, even better. Some trade-off is inevitable when you “let air in” and enable employees to solve their own problems.

This attitude of enablement sits atop a pattern I see time and time again. The discussions I’ve had with users of enterprise software show that employees tend to be extremely capable people who want reliable tools, not gimmicky gadgets or a magical robot that thinks for them.

Delight still has its place, mostly in areas where I’m not looking to become a badass. Kathy’s book uses the phrase “compelling context” to denote a domain in which a user wants to excel. In my example, plumbing and tax preparation are not compelling contexts, so I’ll happily pay for a delightful solution to the problem—and then I’ll get back to my compelling contexts like photography or playing the guitar. In those areas, I’m buying sharp knives.

If you’ve worked in customer support, you may be skeptical. I get it. But, please…go talk to some users in their environment and watch them work. Odds are, they’re as good at their jobs as you are at yours. See how they’re absorbing everything around them and still delivering results while flipping back and forth between six different apps.

Schrodinger’s Inbox,"Let’s talk about Schrodinger’s cat for a second, shall we? Remember Schrodinger? He has a box, and inside that box is a cat. But I’m not just talking about any old cardboard box. The box is a special box — it either kills the cat or keeps the cat alive. But for just a moment, right before Schrodinger looks underneath the box, the cat is neither dead, nor alive. It’s both. It’s in a state that physicists call “superposition”. It’s both dead and alive. And all it takes is for Schrodinger to look underneath and see that his cat is dead. By looking into the box, the state of superposition collapses in on itself, and he kills the cat.

But I’m not worried about dead cats, or Schrodinger’s box, or any of that. I’m more worried about that email that’s going to tell me if the deal went through. Nobody’s ever told you about Schrodinger’s inbox, I’m sure, but let me tell you, it’s almost as deadly and mind-numbing as Schrodinger’s cat.

If this deal goes through, I’m a millionaire. Everything I’ve worked toward for the last two years is packed tightly into the pixels of this single email. But it’s not even my inbox. It’s Schrodinger’s inbox.

I’m not one to engage numbers with six zeroes. Or five zeroes. Or even four zeroes. If there are numbers with six zeroes in my life, they’re surely not associated with my bank account. More likely, they’re the number of opportunities I’ve missed, or the odds that I’ll ever be anything other than a high school dropout, or the number of miles I’m going to have to travel before I find myself.

If the deal goes through, and I open Schrodinger’s inbox to find that email with the contract signed and ready to launch, almost everything in my life changes. Without a doubt, it’ll change the way people perceive me, but in the end, I might still be that confused, misguided kid who couldn’t finish high school. I’ll just have more money in the bank, more of an excuse to justify why I didn’t live the life society expected of me.

The anticipation scrapes my mind, but I’m not one to stay with my finger glued to the refresh button, like some Hollywood version of Mark Zuckerberg. Instead, I wait until long after I know that I’ve already received this life-changing message.

It’s waiting in my inbox: Schrodinger’s inbox. Which means that I’m stuck in this state of superposition. Neither a millionaire, nor a non-millionaire. Neither rich nor poor. Neither with or without an excuse for leaving high school. Society accepts me, and scoffs at me. My parents are proud, and disappointed. The last two years of my life are a violent waste of time, and a brilliant investment.

I wait. I tell myself that I’ll check it at the end of the day, but the end of the day arrives, and I refuse to check Schrodinger’s inbox.

I’m not afraid of losing the deal. I’m not afraid of failing, or being rejected. I’m staying in this state of superposition for as long as I can, because I’m afraid that I might open Schrodinger’s inbox, find that I’m a millionaire, and find that nothing else has changed. So I’ll stay here — both dead and alive, both a failure and a success, for as long as I can.",https://medium.com/a-story-each-day/schrodinger-s-inbox-d65ef6f64144,['A Story Each Day'],2015-11-16 02:22:48.174000+00:00,"['Short Story', 'Fiction', 'A Story Each Day']"
The Agency Developer,"If you enjoy semantics-fueled tête-à-têtes, then I highly recommend The Atlantic article Programmers Should Not Call Themselves Engineers, and a response from Wired entitled Programmers, Let’s Earn the Right to Be Called Engineers. They both go on about accountability and burdens. Node is mentioned. It’s very interesting.

And I’ve come to realize that I don’t really consider myself a Programmer or an Engineer. I’ve always preferred the term Developer (Web Developer if you’re nasty). As I’ve grown in this industry and become more and more an agency man, that is, spending the majority of my career working for marketing agencies, I’ve come to have a special relationship with the term and all that it means to me.

But first, a quick sidetrack to look at what I think it isn’t.

A while back I toured the amazing Atlanta Tech Village, which included a look at one of the many companies taking up residence there. We walked in to a company of maybe 15 people and a found ourselves straddling the border between two warring factions. On one side, a bright room, with windows open and ears mostly un-headphoned, sat the marketers, project managers, and leadership. On the other side, in total darkness on a lovely summer day, sat the be-hoodied and silent programmers, dutifully tackling tickets and feature requests.

I’ve been writing code for about 12 years now. And it’s always with the lights on. I wear headphones, though usually with one ear uncovered so no one has to yell to get my attention. And look, no ill-will towards those guys (they were all guys) coding away in the dark. They build products and I know the focus it takes to hold something that massive and complex in your head while working on it.

But if you present yourself as someone who cannot be bothered, you won’t be. You won’t be invited to strategy meetings, or involved in client pitches, or pulled away from your daily work to secretly build something amazing.

It is my ardent hope to learn how to hire people that will gun for my job. So it occurred to me to simply write down what one would have to do in order to unseat me. And then you’ll know what being an agency developer means to me.",https://medium.com/morrison-writes/the-agency-developer-e2252b6d138c,['Chris Davis'],2015-12-03 20:44:24.707000+00:00,"['Programming', 'Agencylife', 'Business Tips']"
Mobile SaaS FTW,"It’s been over two years that Christoph first wrote about our interest in mobile SaaS and the number of mobile apps from the Point Nine Portfolio has since increased quite notably:

SaaS and non-SaaS P9Family mobile apps (not all fit the screen)

In fact, out of all 27 SaaS investments we did with Fund II, 25% of the companies are mobile-first and another 40% offer at least some of their functionality on native mobile apps. Plus the remaining batch includes companies like Contentful, Algolia, Typeform and Remerge that are riding on the wave of mobile adoption. So yea, it is becoming a real thing in SaaS.

Why mobile matters

The first waves of SaaS tools like Salesforce and Zendesk were essentially replacing big incumbents that were offering expensive, customised on-premise software to BIG enterprise clients. Through digital distribution these SaaS pioneers opened up the rest of the market by making it more accessible, affordable and easier to use.

Mobile is changing this again. The fact that everybody now carries a small computer in their pockets expands the opportunity for SaaS companies into markets that traditionally might not have relied on computers — or have done so to a much lesser extent. Kevin Spain of Emergence Capital has coined these solutions ‘Deskless Enterprise Apps’ in this excellent presentation and it’s an area we are very excited about.

To give you some concrete examples, we have for instance invested in mobile SaaS tools for field services (Jobber), field sales (Handshake), classrooms (Showbie), real estate agents (Happy Inspector) and merchandisers (TBA). All of them have one thing in common: The end-users of these solutions were not in front of a computer five years ago.

What this means

I think there is still a lot of opportunity across most industries: Construction is heating up, health care is still wide open and there are interesting things happening in agriculture (among many other verticals).

These mobile opportunities also come with their own difficulties though: More education might be necessary, ARPAs might be lower & churn higher (at first) and it might be harder to figure out the right distribution channels. Yet I am very confident that time will play in our favour and a lot of big mobile-first companies will be built in the coming years.

A few lessons learned (so far)

To leave you with some practical take-aways, here a few things we have learned along the way.

App stores are not a great distribution channel

In contrast to mobile consumer apps, where an Apple / Google feature can make you, this will most likely not apply to you. Even if you end up reaching the right user (which is hard, as the App Store is so untargeted), it is most likely not the person that would be paying for the solution. So in most cases you are better off focusing on traditional SaaS distribution channels like content marketing or inside sales.

No mobile app can kill a deal

In some cases, not having a mobile application as a companion to your desktop app can break a deal. Especially in competitive spaces and big budgets, a mobile application can be part of a checklist that is hard to argue away. If your buyers require a mobile app, you are probably well off investing in a mobile MVP early on, especially if you have long sales cycles.

Start simple when moving from web

That being said, if you are moving from web to mobile, don’t try to cram all of your functionality into the app. Start with the core use case (or atomic user journey) and then add functionality as you learn more about what your customers need on mobile. If you have the resources, it might make sense to put a dedicated team on this, as it helps to come up with a fresh view.

You want to be on at least two platforms (duh)

Some companies might use iOS devices, others Android. Some might even use Windows tablets (theoretically) and others a mix of all of them. It’s rather obvious that you should be on the two biggest platforms as you will otherwise experience a heavy scattering loss in your marketing activities, especially when you start spending real money to scale.

Know your users

Mobile SaaS plays can be different from traditional SaaS tools as the managers, buyers or administers that you sell to often use a different part of the software (the web version) than the end users themselves (the mobile app). This can lead to an information asymmetrie in which you are building around the requirements of the desktop users and neglect the actual (usually higher number of) end users. Keep that in mind when building your roadmap and try to stay in touch with all of your users, for instance by using NPS or feedback surveys on all usage levels.

To BYOD or not to BYOD

It is also relevant to understand on which devices your application is used. If it is a BYOD environment, you might want to factor that in when you think about what features to leverage. You probably want to avoid spamming users with push notifications in their downtime for instance and be careful not to provoke counter-productive behaviours.",https://medium.com/point-nine-news/mobile-saas-ftw-c4115d37e880,['Nicolas Wittenborn'],2015-11-02 15:28:57.090000+00:00,"['Startup', 'SaaS', 'Mobile']"
Indiana Jones & the Plot Hole of Doom,"So there’s a fan theory floating around the past few years that Indiana Jones “doesn’t matter” to the story of my favorite movie of all time, Raiders of the Lost Ark. He’s in the plot, but he doesn’t drive the plot. And if you’ve studied the storyline of the movie as closely as I have, you know that Indy pretty much fails, screws up and gets thwarted the entire movie, right up to the very last scene. The only thing he does manage to do, is survive.

But I’d like to take it a step further than that. I’d like to argue that Indiana Jones surviving this adventure, changed the course of world history. And sadly, not in a good way.

It started with a Big Bang Theory episode in which a character sees Raiders for the first time. Her reaction: “Indiana Jones doesn’t matter to the outcome of the film.” She explains that if he wasn’t in the movie, the Nazis still would have ended up opening the Ark and melting, exploding, and generally turning into beef jerky in God’s flame-broiler of wrath.

That’s not exactly true, as others have already pointed out. Indiana possesses the Headpiece to the Staff of Ra, which has markings on both sides, while the Nazis have a replica Headpiece with markings on only one side. Which means, “They’re digging in the wrong place.” Without him, they would never have found the Ark at all, and my childhood nightmares wouldn’t have been populated with screeching Angels of Death.

Sorry Toht, you have one too many kadams.

Then again, if Indiana hadn’t shown up at Marion’s bar in Nepal, the Nazis would have gotten the actual Headpiece, built the Staff of Ra to the correct length, and found the Ark anyway.

But rewind the story a little further, to the beginning, and imagine that Prof. Jones never leaves the university, or worse, ends up squished under that boulder in South America. There’s nothing and no one to stop the Nazis from torturing Marion until she hands over the Headpiece, they find the Ark, and Yahweh kicks Nazi ass.

That’s all, folks? Not even close.

If Indiana Jones is killed, injured, captured, or never goes on the hunt for the Ark, the following chain of events would happen:

The Nazis get the Staff of Ra and dig up the Ark. Maybe someone along the way is killed by an asp, but no biggie, they’re Nazi goons.

They transport the Ark on the flying wing to the secret island. (No tough guys get churned into hamburger meat in a propeller blade. No show-stopping truck chases happen. No U-boat rides hanging on the periscope by a bullwhip.)

Belloq puts on a tallis, chants a Haftorah, and opens the Ark.

This DJ is off the hook.

Faces melt, heads explode, and laser beams shoot into and out of eyeballs.

What’s left is a barren chamber with the Ark glowing and purring proudly.

End of story, right?

Not quite, kemosabe.

Without Indy and Marion left alive after the Ark slams shut, there are no Americans to take the Ark back to Washington to be studied by top men.

Instead, worker Nazis on the secret island would eventually figure out that Belloq & Co. are missing, come to collect the Ark…

And deliver it to Adolf Hitler.

Hitler gathers his top Nazi brass to show off his latest acquisition.

He opens it up like it’s National Socialist Christmas.

And boom. Adolf, meet Adonai. Not your biggest fan.

Thus ending World War 2.

In 1936.

Long before the worst that’s to come.

Allow me to repeat.

If Indiana Jones doesn’t raid the Lost Ark, Hitler dies.

If Indiana gets killed at any point along the adventure, Hitler dies.

If Indiana gets a concussion and ends up in the hospital, Hitler dies.

But Indy didn’t do any of those things. He survived.

A new era?,"If data is ‘the new oil’, as it’s sometimes described, and attention is a currency, then how now do we make the best use of all their riches?

The question of whether surveillance and freedom of expression can possibly co-exist online is a big, existential one.

It’s a question Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Cory Doctorow, and others have suggested we ask and answer, and maybe we answer it by thinking differently.

While the machines are doing huge amounts of computational thinking, can we try and match that by activating our own collective reasoning.

The digital revolution is often viewed as the most significant thing on our human timeline since the Gutenberg press. Other notable observers of digital development such as Bill Thompson see it as being more profound than that, as important as the invention of writing itself.

What we can do with code may reinvent what we consider to be humanity. Code’s now a primal ingredient within our human existence, as fundamental to man and womankind and how it expresses itself as anything we’ve ever imagined.

The digital era might be a radically different chapter in our human story, as pivotal as the earliest civilizations of the Fertile Crescent, with similar shifts in capability that modern humanity can achieve as a consequence. This time, however, data can make us more conscious about what we do with the potential that technology offers to us as a superconnected planet. But to access that potential, maybe a line in the sand is needed.

As a result of recorded history over the centuries, and with access to the levels of information we enjoy today, we’ve an opportunity to view our chronology and place in the world in ways our ancestors never enjoyed as an option. Today, things are different for us, and acknowledging that difference makes the change more readily possible.

Our story on our timeline has been told as two ages to date, B.C.E. and C.E., the ‘Before Common Era’ and the ‘Common Era’. Why stop there? Maybe now there’s a third.

Interacting our way to a new Era

From B.C.E. to C.E. to D.E., the Digital Era. In these Emergent Code chronicles and with the arrival of a state of being that is ubiquitously digital, I think we’re looking at a marked shift in human existence, a whole new epoch.

This is the first time we’re co-existing with something that will become as dominant in our world as we are, a new age that will be characterized by code.

And if the Digital Era is to matter to us and sustain us as a new chapter of human history, it will be because it brings benefits in the form of accelerated social learning and future value that are a consequence of us being connected. It will enable us to make a step change, as digital humans, for the better.

Unfamiliar as this new world is, one thing seems clear. It’s not code alone that will make or break us, but how well we blend it, consciously, with what we decide is the ideal way we can be human.

Determining our next OS

As we take the first steps in this digital world, there is still much uncertainty, understandably, in the air about the footprints we want to make. It might be the future doesn’t even need us. It might be that the biggest challenge we face is fighting our own obsolescence, as we become sabotaged by our own learned helplessness acquired during the industrial age of hard labour.

We can renew, as digital humans, reconnecting to our origins, using code to elevate our intelligence. There are several possible futures, narratives and directions to explore using code. These chronicles are designed to draw attention to the idea that, for the first time, we have the chance to determine the next chapters of our timeline, using digital and human connectivity intentionally, and that chance starts here.

The web has introduced a new universal operating system into the world. It is creating collective intelligences and new domains. It is organizing us in new ways, building bridges between languages, fashioning transnational values sets, redrawing human boundaries and inventing types of interactivity.

The digital environment is changing our own OS as a result of our increasing involvement and dependence upon it and code is introducing challenging assumptions that will shift us out of conventional comfort zones.

The next chapter of humanity’s timeline isn’t something just a few people in Silicon Valley or politicians have the right to decide. It’s for everyone. We each have a chance and the tools to think about what we want now; we can make our choices and define our social cultures more purposefully than through random acts of digital Darwinism if we develop our skills as digital humans.

For millennia, there have been unknowns concerning the existential nature of humankind. The mysteries of life have enthralled and tested us. The asynchronicity of it and its random events have meant that the joy of self-discovery’s been a part of our heritage, part of the wonder of being alive.

But, as Joseph Goebbels once said ‘The propagandist must be the man with the greatest knowledge of souls’. Issues like how to reconcile the tensions that exist online between liberty and surveillance go to the core of that human soul. How do we ‘dance like no-one’s watching’ when everyone’s watching? In an age of digital surveillance and data-based intelligence, indeed, will we even know how to be free?

Stalin promoted the ‘engineering of souls’ in his speech at the home of Maxim Gorky back in 1932. Today, there is ‘fracketeering’ a more networked and dispersed kind of bad guy, a world in which networked terms and conditions apply, a world in which, your money or your life is not simply the utterance of highwaymen.

An alternative scenario, one that we’ve yet to fully develop, is focused on generating pleasure from sharing who we are, developing communities of belonging and trust relationships within a worldwide network.

Using code and developing a greater intelligence through data, it’s going to be up to us whether we will get the Digital Era we deserve.",https://medium.com/emergent-code/a-new-era-f3d443b340a2,['Anne Mccrossan'],2015-11-24 09:08:12.306000+00:00,"['Civilization', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Innovation']"

The tennis ball theory of investing,"What goes up comes down!

Normally I write about Corporate Social Responsibility. But the pandemonium in stock markets across the world as I write about the future of CSR, has forced me to declare the secret of investing. I shall show you both how not to lose and how to make money through investing. Now, if you got this far, you probably think I am going to try and sell you something. No, I am not! Do read on and/or look at a 7min interview.

Part of my own personal social responsibility is to give you some free advice so that when you do gain you can use gains to invest in anything that would make the world a better place. I am just going to write down my theory which I have used all my life and also one that I suggest to my friends and relations around the world. Have I been successful? Yes, although worrying about my personal investments and the stock markets is not, and has never been, my main interest.

You see one of the biggest problems with investment analysts, TV broadcasters such as Quest and that shouty fellow on MSNBC who is ridiculous is that they simply reproduce past trends and assume that trends will continue into the future. Oh yes, they’ll add in a few remarks about market fundamentals and company credentials etc. As long as markets act in a straight line trend they are fine. But what we all know is that markets suddenly crash and the straight line is no more. What we get is a parabolic curve..in fact very much like the trajectory of a tennis ball.

Hence the tennis ball theory of investing. Like a tennis ball what goes up, eventually comes down. Happily it then bounces back up again, but not always to where it was before. The same thing with stock markets. What goes up, comes down. Now, of course, the big problem is to know the ‘turning point’ i.e. when will the market go down and when will it rise again? I am not talking about day to day fluctuations, but about major falls and major rises. Did you ever hear investment analysts talking about turning points? Rarely!

So how can you spot a turning point? Well not easy. We know that simply throwing darts at a list of stocks is at least as successful as all investment analysts on average. And, yes purely randomly some investment analysts are going to be correct but you cant know which ones apriori! Of any one million investment analysts there may be as many as 10,000 who are correct i.e. one per cent! But are they correct consistently? No, the probabilities are against them. One per cent of one percent, if there are a million will give you 100..maybe one of their names might be Warren Buffet..he does good analysis and does think out of the box. But no need to pay him anything just think of a tennis ball!

Anyway, back to turning points and how to spot them. Normally these are obvious. When the price of oil goes up to, what was it $US147 a barrel and you know the swing producer Saudia Arabia cost of production is less than $7…something has got to happen. At $147 a barrel, massive investments take place even for the hardest to reach minerals…gradually creating a huge surplus of oil followed by a crash (in parenthesis all that talk about Peak Oil and finite resources was laughable…there will always be resources when the price goes up…no the earth is not finite!). When the Dow Jones hit 12,000 I was worried..when it went up to 20,000 heck I am out! When the dollar went down to 80 centimes per one Swiss France, heck I am buying dollars..they are around 95 centimes today…about a 20% gain in a year.

So like a tennis ball, what goes up comes down. Happily it goes up again. Maybe tennis balls are more predictable than stock markets or commodity prices but frankly if Murray serves to me I dont know where it will drop nor when it will go up again (OK we are talking nano-seconds here), but the ball does come down and it does go up again.

So my tennis ball theory advice today (Aug 26 2015)? Looks like oil at below $US40 a barrel is a good time to buy. Yes it may go down to $US20…then mass consumption will bring it up again. Like a tennis ball. Of course no-one can predict exactly when are the turning points we just know that sometimes they are obvious to pick — house prices in the USA anyone? The turning points will come just like a bouncing tennis ball. Please listen and invest accordingly. This free advice will save you money and as it will, please don’t forget to invest in socially responsible projects since even if they crash you will have the benefit of helping someone!

"POPCORN EXISTENTIALISM #3: MARGARET, OR THE GROUCHO-MARXISM OF FLORENCE","POPCORN EXISTENTIALISM #3: MARGARET, OR THE GROUCHO-MARXISM OF FLORENCE

French director Xavier Giannoli rewrites the tale of wannabe diva Florence Foster Jenkins as a Parisian “lady who lunches” in search of herself

Yes, but can she sing? Catherine Frot as Marguerite, with her facilitating butler (Denis Mpunga) at the piano. Photo by Dusan Martincek © Fidélité Films/Sirena Film/Scope Pictures/Memento Films International

If you look at the name French director Xavier Giannoli gave to the heroine of his new feature, Marguerite, and if you’re an attentive cinephile, you may have an inkling where he’s coming from. Marguerite Dumont, like the great comic actress Margaret Dumont, “the fifth Marx Brother” in the words of Groucho himself, is a more than appropriate name for Catherine Frot’s character — and it’s a stunning, note-perfect performance, always hovering between utter cluelessness regarding how others see her and open-hearted generosity towards those around her. Not unlike Dumont herself.

The tale of this wealthy “lady who lunches” from 1920s Paris, an aspiring but totally talentless artiste who follows her dream of becoming an opera singer, may be inspired by the real story of Florence Foster Jenkins (herself the subject of a Stephen Frears film due in 2016, with Meryl Streep in the role), but it’s not played for laughs at Marguerite’s expense. Instead, it’s a wonderful example of how to respect your character and your story, finding the exact balance of comedy and tragedy, as Frot and Giannoli take their time in unveiling the woman behind the surface.

Married to a building magnate (André Marcon) with little time for her and even less inclination for the arts, with too much time and money on her hands, Marguerite doesn’t look at music as a passing fad, or as a pastime to be explored until she is fed up. She isn’t a mere dilettante trying on things for size; she is forthright and sincere in her love for music and desire to sing, and therein lies the key to Marguerite’s poignancy, well pointed out in the growing respect those around her start finding for her.

How can you be a fraud if you’re looking for yourself? Photo by Dusan Martincek © Fidélité Films/Sirena Film/Scope Pictures/Memento Films International

Even if initially incredulous, Lucien (Sylvain Dieuaide) and Hazel (Christa Théret), the journalist and the singer who work as the viewer’s way into the strange, privileged world of Marguerite, come around to understand the love and dedication she puts into it, the fact that her heart is in it as much as theirs is. So who’s the fraud here? Is it Marguerite for believing in a talent she does not realise she does not have, or those around her who take advantage of her for their own ends?

Giannoli wraps that inside an intriguing, if slightly undeveloped, romantic battle for her heart — between Georges, the inattentive husband who slowly understands the role music plays in her life, and Madelbos (Denis Mpunga), the devoted, over-protective butler who will stop at nothing to realize her dreams. Both love Marguerite unconditionally, and show it in opposite ways, but to what end? And if she is pursuing her dream come hell or high water, how can we fault her?

Marguerite is an expertly crafted piece, shot in a beautifully textured widescreen by DP Glynn Speeckaert like a studio melodrama of the 1940s seen through a 1970s lens, flowing from classic melodrama about a woman following her heart into an ensemble piece about those she touches and back. And none of it would make any sense without Frot’s wondrously generous performance at its heart, her Marguerite both mystifying and welcoming — somewhere between the all-too-human absurdities of Groucho and the all-too-human poignancy of Harpo. Marguerite does not give you an answer, but makes you understand the woman.

I’m afraid of Americans,"A few years ago I was working at Northwestern University when, one dull afternoon, everyone’s phones, desk and cell, started ringing at the same time. I picked up my cell and heard an automated message that a gunman had been seen on campus and everybody was supposed to lock down.

Oh, I didn’t realize it until now, but this is my worst nightmare, I thought to myself. I wonder if I’ll die.

Eventually the lockdown got called off and I don’t know whatever happened to the gunman — it might have been a figment of someone’s imagination, or maybe he just walked away. That wasn’t, of course, the first time I ever contemplated how dying in a mass public shooting is a horrific way to lose your life (or, perhaps even worse, to hear that it happened to a loved one), but it was closer than the other ways I had experienced it, which was through the news.

Stories of public shootings in the States have always distressed me but since I’ve had children, I’ve become nearly obsessed, reading the stories and then going into the comments and tweets and Facebook threads because I live in disbelief that there are people — many, many people — in this country who think that things are fine the way they are. If I’m being quite honest, it fills me with an ironic murderous rage, like, yes, if I could shoot the person who would cast the deciding vote against amending gun control so that things like the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting never happened again, I would. Good thing I don’t own a gun.

So I do what I can, which is donate money to causes I believe in (which exist, for the record, to pass better gun control laws, not to take away existing guns), correspond with my congresspeople and try to speak my mind in a somewhat cogent way on social media, because I think ending a post with “idiot” does not do much to earn you credibility or new listeners.

However, I don’t feel like I’m doing much, and that only stokes my fear. My fear used to be that I would be caught in some sort of public shooting, or, worse, that my children would be, but lately that fear has been replaced by a new type of terror:

I’m scared that people live in fear of terrorism but not enough to demand legislation that prevents potential terrorists from legally purchasing guns.

I’m scared that some people are against “big government” and then donate money to the NRA, which has control over what the CDC is allowed to study and report.

I’m scared that people feel comfortable advertising how lightly they take putting guns into the hands of their children despite the fact that things like this can and actually have happened.

I’m scared that many people thought it was, I don’t know, brave or funny or kick-ass to fire rounds into a copy of a newspaper that reported the news that many people are frightened.

I’m scared that people have decided that when the founding fathers wrote the Second Amendment, it meant that it would be appropriate and patriotic to stalk around a place of worship with weapons visible.

I’m scared about how we repeatedly let ourselves get caught up in time-wasting semantics about whether another murder is terrorism or “merely” a mass shooting, making sure we know the killers’ skin color and religion and political beliefs before we really pass judgment on the event, and whether it’s disrespectful to suggest that actions and policy are more effective than thought and prayer, as if once we establish all that we can really get to the business at hand.

And I’m still scared to live in a country where 20 children — children — can be shot to death, and the government doesn’t change a single thing about it. (Compared to when, say, the Our Lady of Angels School fire killed 87 children in Chicago in 1958 and sweeping changes in school fire safety regulations were enacted nationwide to ensure it never happened again.) Sandy Hook could happen again tomorrow and every day this week and still many people would say, “Your dead kids don’t trump my rights.”

How can this possibly be? How can we all live in the same country and use the same currency and postal system and celebrate the same government holidays and watch the same sporting events and use the same social networks? I’m terrified that I live amongst these people.

I have come to realize that I can do a few tiny things but I can only do so much, take in so much, before I start to lose my mind and the gratitude and joy for the many things I have. It has happened a few times in the last few weeks where I was distracted from my healthy, beautiful, bright children because I was caught up in reading as many facts and comments as I could about shootings and gun control and gun rights, which is not a good use of my time. A trip to Target felt morbid last week as I contemplated how easy it would be to shoot up a place like that, how hollow and ridiculous all the Christmas decorations were when the country is like this. But at the same time, my boys don’t know that. It’s my job — and my privilege — to make this time special to them. It’s hard to get into the Christmas spirit though, I tell you.

Maybe in some respects the world was better before social media, when I merely lived in this country but wasn’t so blatantly aware of exactly what my fellow citizens think. It feels bizarre and purposefully ignorant to aspire to close myself off from the world, especially as a writer and a blogger, but now this is what I’m facing. I feel like if the world is this frightening, if I can’t do anything about it beyond donating money and saying what I can say, at a certain point all I can do is try to shut down and pull the covers above my head, at least sometimes. Maybe it’s safe under there.",https://medium.com/bigger-picture/i-m-afraid-of-americans-65a6034ae014,['Claire Zulkey'],2015-12-08 15:40:41.708000+00:00,"['Gun Violence', 'Gun Control', 'Gun Sense']"
Relativity’s Landscape,"When Scientific American contacted OCR with the prompt of visualizing the impact of Einstein’s General Relativity theory on the centenary of its publication, we were pretty excited. We had a few ideas of avenues to explore, but first we needed a dataset.

First attempts and dead-ends

Princeton University recently digitized all the papers and correspondence that Albert Einstein wrote from his youth until 1923, which can be browsed on their digital collection. While Einstein was developing the general theory of relativity for about a decade, it wasn’t until the Field Equations of Gravitation paper, published in November 1915, that he finalized the mathematical models necessary to support his theory. Our initial concept was to use this paper as a starting point in a citations trail to map the reaches of the General Relativity paper over the past 100 years.

We looked at a number of open and closed scientific databases, such as Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science, to see how we could go about creating a citations trail. However, while some databases were more complete than others, very few contained citations data that predated 1970. This has to do with the fact that citations in scientific papers were not as standardized in the early part of the twentieth century as they are now, and that scientific databases are more likely to upload newer papers and citations data than historical data.

There has to be a better way…

Since there were too many gaps charting the impact of general relativity over time through citations, we decided to use the plethora of current scientific papers to take a snapshot of research actively engaging with principles derived from the theory of general relativity.

We decided to use Cornell University Library’s open database arXiv.org, which some consider to be the most current repository of research since scientists can upload papers before they’ve been published. ArXiv.org also categorizes papers that pertain to different areas of science, and within that, physics. One of arXiv.org’s subcategories of Physics is General Relativity — Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc). For our dataset, we selected papers with gr-qc as their primary category, since we could be sure that they related to general relativity. We looked at all papers in the gr-qc category that were uploaded to arXiv.org in 2014, to give us the most recent complete year of papers.

The ins and outs of an API

While arXiv.org is great in that it’s an open database (not behind a paywall), and has an API, the API is a bit confusing to use and not fully documented. For instance, we were interested in accessing references and citations for papers, which can be done on the website, but there was no call in the API outlining how to do so (we were left to our own devices to get this data…). In addition, we couldn’t query by year, but had to use the somewhat clunky “start” and “max_results” filters with the sortBy filter set to “submittedDate” to get the year we were interested in.

While we did collect citations data from arXiv.org, there weren’t that many citations linkages since all the papers we examined are from 2014, and don’t often cite one another since they’re all very recent. We needed to generate our own metrics to determine the most popular research topics related to general relativity. For each paper in the the General Relativity — Quantum Cosmology category we collected the following information:

Title

Abstract

List of Authors

URL

Primary Category

Subcategories (if any)

References (if any)

Citations (if any)

Published / Not yet published

Example of a record returned by the arXiv.org API

If at first we don’t succeed, let artificial intelligence take the lead

Since we couldn’t rely on citations data to create links between papers, we decided to look to the text of the abstracts to see if we could group papers based on common research areas. We turned to the Alchemy API to process the 2,435 paper abstracts of all the papers added to arXiv.org in 2014 and tagged with General Relativity — Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) as their primary category. The Alchemy API, which is now part of IBM’s Watson platform, lets users leverage machine learning capabilities for image and text processing. We were specifically interested in the AlchemyLanguage Concept Tagging API, which we used to analyze the paper abstracts.

When we ran the corpus of abstracts through the Alchemy API it returned a list of concepts, as well as a score of relevance for each detected concept, with a range of 0.0–1.0, 1.0 being the most relevant. Alchemy returned over 1500 concepts after analyzing the 2,435 abstracts. We totaled the scores for each concept to determine the “most popular concepts” among all the abstracts. This list was heavily edited to cull redundant words, topics, and finally reduced to 61 concept terms that the editors at SciAm deemed relevant to physics and general relativity.

Laying out the network — making connections and forming relationships

First, we wanted to see how the concepts themselves related to one another. Using a network graph layout, we created links between concept terms that were found in the same papers. When we evaluated a pair of concept terms, we counted what percentage of the total papers they share in common, as well as their combined Alchemy relevance score. Using the toxiclibs Processing library, we generated a basic layout model for the concepts. If two terms have a higher percentage of papers that share those terms, they have a stronger network graph link. The terms with more connections were more fixed (and more popular), and provided the central nodes that the other terms organized around.

The base network of 61 concepts, brighter nodes are concepts that appear in more papers.

After laying out the 61 concept terms in the network diagram, we needed to arrange the papers around the terms they referenced. Using a particle physics simulation, terms acted as gravitational attractors to the papers. Daniel Shiffman’s Box2D processing library was used to prevent articles from overlapping while they were being pulled towards their preferred location. This pushed articles upward that grouped around more popular terms, creating peaks around terms like ‘Black holes’ and ‘Quantum gravity.’ Although there were over 1500 concepts that Alchemy had returned from all the papers, a few of the papers did not contain any chosen concept terms since we’d narrowed it down to 61. If papers did not contain one of the 61 chosen concepts, we used a combination of shared references, citations, and keyword matching with the abstract text to locate the papers nearest to the papers most relevant to them.

While the visualizations for the print version of Scientific American are more legible as top and side views, we created them with a 3D layout built with Processing.

Moving from a 2D to a 3D world

For the interactive component to the graphic, we decided to let users explore the 3D environment, allowing them to zoom in and out on areas that interested them. In order to draw in 3D on the web we turned to three.js, the wonderful WebGL library created by mrdoob. We saved out the positions of the terms and papers from the print version generated in Processing, and used these values to draw the shapes in three.js.

Some notes on our approach

Since the graphic was published, we’ve seen questions pop up on Twitter about our process for laying out the papers. Someone suggested we might have used the t-SNE method to layout the papers, which visualizes multi-dimensional aspects of data in 2D space. We didn’t use a multi-dimensional approach, but relied on the Alchemy API and network layout models to group the papers after analyzing their abstracts.

Our visualization approach was not as straightforward as you would get in a layout function from Gephi, but more an interpretive analysis that allowed us to spatialize the dataset around concepts that we curated for relevance. The Alchemy API allowed us to generate numerical relationships between the papers themselves when a citations link did not exist. As we laid out the articles in a sort of generative terrain, we realized that we needed to give more “gravity” to unpopular terms, so that the large groupings forming around popular terms would disperse into more discrete clusters.

And some lessons learned

One aspect we found interesting are the articles with more than 850 authors, which are highlighted in red in the visualization. Articles with this many authors are all related to the LIGO Detector gravitational wave detection, and authored by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. It was also surprising to realize that one paper, submitted in March of 2014, had already been cited 85 times a year later. This paper focused on advancements of tests of the general theory, which are still being done today, which made us realize how much of science is a constant process of experimentation and re-evaluation, even with ideas that have been given the status of “theory.”

This project involved a fair amount of trial and error. Sometimes there is a promising germ of an idea but it’s hard to predict what the data will actually yield. The kind of visualization that is possible to create depends on the data that can be found and understood. As is often the case, datasets are not always complete, or readily accessible. Working with a historian of science to map citations in early physics papers would have been great, but we needed to change directions once we realized that wasn’t feasible in our scope of time. As designers, there are a many ways we can tell a story, and determining the best way forward is an iterative process of research, sketching and prototyping. Sometimes a visualization utilizes “neutral” scientific data, while other times, like this, it depicts a collaboration between natural language processing algorithms and scientific expertise and curation. In any case, it’s not quite a surprise that Einstein’s ideas are still relevant today, but it is amazing to realize how many aspects of research in the quest to better understand our universe they’ve made possible.",https://medium.com/memo-random/relativity-s-landscape-422d4f7ed20e,['The O.C.R.'],2015-09-03 20:05:16.207000+00:00,"['Visualization', 'Big Data', 'Physics']"
Finstagram: The Instagram Revolution,"What is a Finsta and why are teenagers changing the way that they use Instagram?

Instagram is easily the most important social media for teens around the world, as many of you know from recent studies. Whether it be my 13 year old sister or my 19 year old cousin, we all check Instagram constantly. The stream of infinite content and the simple concept and idea behind the product never gets old. When I post a photo on Instagram I know that just about every person I am connected to in the real life will see my photo, decide whether or not to like it, and then judge me subconsciously. Because of this, Instagram is seen as a huge stressor for many teenagers.

Your Instagram defines who you are.

However, at the same time that Instagram continues to push through in building up one’s online identity, there is a dramatic change that is coming to the way that Instagram is used.

I first heard the term ‘finsta’ a few months ago, my friend, Caroline, pulled out her phone, we snapped a funny selfie and she immediately uploaded it to Instagram. I was horrified, how could she post a selfie of me onto Instagram without asking! She didn’t add a filter, she didn’t have a clever caption, and it wasn’t a photo I wanted everyone I know to see! I immediately said did you really just post that, she then told me don’t worry I only put it on my finsta. I was so confused.

What she did completely went against all that Instagram has been for me in the past 2 or 3 years I have been on the social network. I have learned that Instagram posts are an art. It can take a lot of time for me to post a photo on Instagram. I need to decide the photo to post, ask friends for advice on captions, make sure every blemish is not seen, and edit it.

I, along with other teens, spend this time because we know that everyone will see it and it can define who you are.

Finstagram (Finsta for short) is defined by Urban Dictionary as “a mixture of Fake & Instagram. People, usually girls, get a second Instagram account along with their real instagrams, rinstagrams, to post any pictures or videos they desire. The photos or videos posted are usually funny or embarrassing. Only your closest friends follow this account.” If you still are not getting it, finsta is sort of a combination between the content you would post on snapchat inside the instagram app.

My friend Caroline’s real instagram

My friend Caroline’s finstagram

At my school I went from only just hearing about this internet phenomenon a few months ago to hearing people talk about finsta accounts everyday.

It is not just normal to have a finsta, it is expected.

Teens are now not just checking and maintaining one Instagram account a day, they are consistently monitoring and updating two accounts, their rinsta and their finsta — one public and open for any acquaintances they may meet and one for just close friends.

Finsta gets rid of the stressful element of Instagram, but in a familiar environment.

The fact that so many people are building second accounts for a different purpose on the same social network shows just how strongly teens are connected to Instagram and how much more potential network actually has.

Instagram has the potential to not only continue to grow in users, but also in time spent online, if people are checking two accounts they are doubling the amount of time they are spending on Instagram making them more likely to see and respond to ads.

In addition, finstagram could be the dark horse in Facebook trying to find a Snapchat Killer. Perhaps letting users log into 2 accounts at the same time, similar to Tumblr. Perhaps letting people have the option of only letting someone see a photo once where it is unable to be viewed after you pass it in the dashboard.

So for everyone out there watch out for finstagrams, they may just change the future of Instagram, and the social networking world as we know it.",https://medium.com/bits-pixels/finstagram-the-instagram-revolution-737999d40014,[],2015-05-30 11:20:14.075000+00:00,"['Tech', 'Instagram', 'Social']"
Medium is my new blog platform?,"Like many people, I am considering using Medium as my new blog platform. Here are my reasons, so far:

The in browser editor is fantastic. It’s super responsive, and creates beautiful output.

Supposedly my stuff will get a built-in audience, if it’s any good. Compared to my current blog, www.salas.com which I’ve been less active on of late.

I am getting the feeling that personal blog servers are becoming passé. I know for me, I am getting tired of paying Squarespace.com $10 per month for a server that I don’t think I use much. (It’s their business model I suppose :)

Truth is that I’ve ported my old blog content across several services over the last 12 or so years. Each time it’s a hassle.

People worry that their content will be ‘locked’ into a proprietary server. They want to ‘own’ their writing. I used to worry about that. Now I think it’s a bit precious. Really, you want to save your writing for posterity?

If I standardize on Medium, I will not be trying to move my old content here. I won’t even look into whether it’s easy or even possible.

What I will have to think about is how to move old content from Squarespace to something free so I don’t have to pay every month as I see it all drift into useless obscurity.

When Desperation Meets Opportunity Chapter 17 — A #NaNoWriMo 2015 Story,"Chapter 17 — Jim

Success! Or, at least I am very close to it. I just destroyed my virtual box, which is perfect. Being that it is a virtual environment inside my computer, that is exactly what I want to happen. I can just load a new one up and try again. Right now, the last of my focus is on getting the virus to delay. Currently, it is immediately executing. However, that also leaves it open to detection. I have the rest of today to complete this, so those are two holes I need to plus. Of course, I haven’t been briefed on what exactly will happen later today, but I’ll enjoy the Sunday of coding as much as I can.

Jake and I took a break from the binary decoding. That works fine by me, seeing as it didn’t appear to be revealing any key information, and I’m not really that concerned about things at the moment. I probably should be, but there will be time for that after I complete my tasks. Since he was so helpful in his support and the mentoring he has done on the coding side of things, I offered him a sizable amount of my money — ten thousand dollars to be exact. Surprisingly, he turned it down. I was shocked. He isn’t in the poor house, but to turn down ten thousand dollars? That is what separates me from him, and perhaps me from a lot of people. The money wasn’t something I was going to question. Short of killing someone, I’d say I would do anything for money at this point. You can judge me after a life of not having all that much.

In any case, my next batch of funds requires me to finish this program. I better focus.

The warmth of the day is beginning to overpower the air conditioning inside of my apartment. I’m not sure if it is hot and stifling in here because of that, or if it is the intense pressure I am feeling. Any second now, Mr. Man will be calling with my next directions. I don’t feel even close to ready to have this conversation. I would certainly feel a whole lot better if I could just get this done. It has to be in here somewhere. One of these lines of code just needs a number or a symbol. I begin combing through the guide Mr. Man sent me and the code I typed. It appears to match up perfectly. What the heck am I doing wrong?

After at least thirty more minutes of carefully going over every single character, I think I found my problem. I typed an “el”, you know, the lowercase letter, instead of the number “1”. In the font in my developer environment, they look almost identical. The one is just a bit taller than the letter I. Stupid serifs. Hopefully I am about to execute my final test. I load up my virtual box one more time, set up the virus on the remote server, and download into the box. Now is the waiting game. The program is supposed to act like a routine update to the system. However, after five minutes of downloading, the triggers fire, which should take down the whole system. Sounds pretty cool, if you ask me. I sure hope the guys I’m doing this to deserve it. It could really be devastating!

Out of curiousity, I checked around online and found a few of my dream places of employment had job openings. With a newfound set of confidence and the first program of written under my belt, I could take on the world right now. I’m sure Jake would also be willing to be a reference for me as well, which would be great. Once I finish my tasks for Mr. Man, I’m hoping to spend the time necessary to apply for some of these positions.

Feeling confident that my virus is completed, I package onto a USB flash drive. I am all ready to go. Butterflies invade my stomach, but not too aggressively. I am weirdly calm for the magnitude of what I am about to do. The only thing I can do now though, is wait. Wait for a call. Wait for somebody. As Tom Petty stated so well, the waiting is the hardest part.

I decide to go to my bedroom and lay down for a while. The constant state of exhaustion from all of this coding is really quite something. My stamina has improved, so I can pack more in each day. But, overall, my brain just needs a break. I’m not sure what that says about my future as a programmer, but I’d like to think containing the work to my nine to five wouldn’t be so bad.

My phone goes off. It is Mr. Man. Finally. I answer.

“Hello?”

“Jim, it is nice to talk to you. You were successful in creating the program, I presume?”

I notice myself smiling as I respond, “You bet. It was tough, but your instructions and training were crucial I’m ready to roll!””

“Excellent! I’m glad to see you are beginning to enjoy this work. Who knows, there might be more where that came from if you keep it up. In any case, we should talk about your next step.” More work from him? Maybe that can be my next place of employment.

“You know I’m game by now. Give to me straight.” I find it interesting how my interactions with Mr. Man have gone from apprehensive to almost cordial in the span of a little over a month. It never occurred to me until now that I might actually enjoy doing these tasks. The conscience in the back of my mind isn’t too happy that I am helping this guy commit some serious crime. But, like I thought before, maybe this company deserves it. “By the way, could you tell me more about this company I’m targeting? It’d make me feel a lot better to know that they are owed what is coming to them.”

“I already told you that they have been insubordinate to my company. If you want a little more explanation, just know that I purchased them because I thought their skills and tactics would help me overtake other companies in my industry. Unfortunately, they decided that they would use their tactics on my company, and try and force me out. I’ve worked hard for my position. This didn’t come easy, and I’m not giving it up easily. You are playing an essential role in my revenge and in keeping my business going. You will make sure that none of this is traced back to me. It is crucial that we maintain that secrecy. Any shred of evidence connecting me to them would almost certainly result in government intervention, and that is not something I’m willing to let happen!” By the end of his comments, his voice has grown in volume to powerful levels. I could tell how convicted he felt about this, and how important it was to him to protect the integrity of his company. If I could do a little dirty work that benefits me and punishes those that deserve it, then it is totally worth it.

“It sounds more than justified what you are doing. I’m glad that I can help in any small way. What is the next step?”

Calming down, he delivers his next words more softly. “Ahh yes. In less than an hour, you will have a visitor at your door. She will be delivering a badge to you that will allow you to access the Ming Security and Defense building on 1516 North State Street in Chicago. Once inside, you will need to find a way to introduce the virus into their network. If you are successful, this will count as your 4th task, and two hundred thousand dollars will be sent your way. We’ll be in touch when you complete this. Thank you.”

A thank you. He is thanking me. What a partnership this has become. However, now I’m wondering about the she he is referring to that is bringing me this badge. How exactly did that come about? Does she work for them and is granting me access? If so, how did he end up connecting with her? This might be the most intriguing question of all, but I won’t need to wait long to find the answer. Since I moved to the city, I’ve been too concerned with getting myself situated to really think about dating. I had a few different flings in college, but nothing that ever substantiated beyond a few late nights together and some extended study sessions, if you know what I mean. In fact, it would probably be late high school the last time I had a girlfriend I would consider serious. I still regret how badly that ended. At work, we are unfortunately still a very male dominated place, so the opportunities to meet people there have been few and far between.

The tangent that just occurred in my mind makes me realize that I really crave companionship. It is frustrating living alone and having no one to share things with. Thankfully Jake has been a great friend, but there are just some things a good woman provides that a friend never could. It just sat on the back burner until now. After all, I can’t even remember the last time I had a casual conversation with a girl in a social setting.

There is a knock at the door. I roll out of the bed and make my way to answer it. As I look around my apartment, I realize that my focus on coding has made an absolutely mess of the place. It might be wise to take a few moments and shove some things in corners before I have company.

“Just a minute — finishing putting some things away!” I shout towards the door as I begin a mad scramble to hide the dishes and piles of clothes. Thankfully I’ve been stuffing the cash in random places in my bedroom, so that is out of sight. Even though I said it would be a minute, it takes me about five to feel good about letting someone in.

Look for Long-Term Gains

@ Acts 15:36–41 | Sunday, March 22, 2015 | Lesson 3/3

This is the third and final study on Barnabas.

PART 1 — WARMING UP, SINGING AND PRAYING

Just a Closer Walk with Thee

PART 2 — BIBLE STUDY

Reading Acts 15:36–41

[To desert] 1. Abandon (a person, cause, or organization) in a way considered disloyal or treacherous

2. Fail (someone), especially at a crucial moment when most needed Mark deserted Paul and went back home

Paul and Barnabas disagree

The discussions about circumcision and about Gentiles in the church took a long time. The result was the meeting in Acts 15. Paul had established churches. Now he was now eager to go back to them. He wanted them to know more about Christ. He wanted them to tell other people, and to spread the gospel in their areas.

Barnabas wanted this too. However, he wanted to take John Mark again. John Mark had left them on their first journey. Paul and Barnabas disagreed about this. Neither of them would change his opinion. The Bible is honest about its heroes. It tells us the truth about this argument. When they had to decide about Gentiles in the church, there was agreement. When Paul and Barnabas had to decide about John Mark, there was no agreement. These people were men — not angels. But the Lord was good to them. He continued to use all three men.

Maybe it was wrong for John Mark to be with Paul again so soon. Paul was about to begin a journey, which became very difficult. Perhaps John Mark needed to be more mature first. Later, Paul was glad to have John Mark with him, (Colossians 4:10; Philemon 23; 2 Timothy 4:11). Barnabas took John Mark with him. They went to Cyprus. We do not know any more about Barnabas. There is a strong tradition that later Barnabas was a martyr there.

Paul took Silas with him. Silas came from the Jerusalem church. This might have been useful to Paul when he had to mention the Acts 15 decision. Certainly, it seems that Silas wanted to spread the gospel far and wide. The result of the disagreement was that there were two groups of missionaries instead of one.

REFLECTIONS

Barnabas, son of encouragement, again, is able to see through Mark, as he did with Paul, and decided, again, to act.

[See through someone or something]

1. Lit. [for one’s vision] to penetrate something clear or opaque or a person. Of course, I can see through the window! With x-rays, they can see through your body!

2. Fig. to understand or detect the true nature of someone or something. You can’t fool me anymore. I can see through you and all your tricks.

As a result of his choice, we see later that:

God use the disagreement to multiply one single mission into two groups; Mark probably appreciates the second change gave to him by Barnabas; and makes the best of it; Mark is back on the road; his contribution does not ends here. The writes the Gospel of Mark; Paul is able to reconcile with Mark, because of the second chance, and recognizes his value.

HOW HARD TO GIVE SOMEONE A SECOND CHANCE?

WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF TRYING TO SEE THROUGH PEOPLE OR SITUATIONS IN LIFE?

WHAT IS THE OTHER DEFINITION FOR IT? WHAT ABOUT DISCERNMENT?

PART 3 — CLOSING

What are your key takeaways from this lesson on Barnabas?

A couple ideas:

The need for action; The role of encouragement; Humility, perseverance, availability, commitment; Generosity, collaboration (Barnabas was a true team player), bring others together, no isolation; Discernment and see through people and situations; and Barnabas was an imitator of Christ.

ILLUSTRATION

Video I saw this week on the importance of encouragement, bringing others, collaborating in churches.

This is a nice illustration of the need to seek for others, specially in churches. we need the others. We need to encourage and be encouraged.

PART 4 - ANNOUNCEMENTS

In April, after Easter, we will start studying the life of Jesus: ""Like no Other"" is a series of eight studies that we will be following.

How to earn long-term commissions with an affiliate shop,"There are people who run a blog or a web-site because they want to communicate themselves. And then there are people who want to earn money with it.

Admittedly the boundaries are not clear and in essence this is not important either. It is important that a blog or a website is a great opportunity to generate reach. And the reach is the aspect which (if done properly) also generates income. At the beginning of this blog I also tried to monetize my blog with a membership model, but failed with it. In the meantime I have made my own experiences and learned from others what works: Affiliate advertisement! This means to advertise for a product and to earn a commission for ones advertising success.

It is a simple principle but not entirely trivial in its realization. Posting a link on Facebook, a text in a blog or switching a banner does not translate into a successful recommendation at all. On the contrary, the chances that after a short period of time no more recommendations are generated are actually quite high.

The solution: Affiliate shops. I find that in contrast to banners or sponsored posts an affiliate shop is a fantastic opportunity to generate sustainable commissions by means of continuous clicks. I am also curious why not already many more people are doing exactly that. You will learn how simple the affiliate shop works later on in the article.

Why Banner Ads are Dying Out

Banners were the ultimate hit over a long period of time in regards to online advertisement. Sidebars plastered up with promotional advertising could not have been more multifaceted. A further banner in the header and another in the text and the overload of the senses was complete. In past times users responded to banner ads since they were new and different to what was known until then. Correspondingly high were the click responses.

This behavior rapidly changed by the intemperance with which these banners were put in place. The greed of individuals made the quality unusable. At the end there was way too much advertisement space and as already said, a complete overload of the senses which had very little to do with recommendations.

The times of the great and qualitative clicks on banners are over by now. If there are some still showing up, than maybe in magazines and only non-animated banners. The useable spaces and the interest of advertisers are reducing parallel (at least that is my feeling). The consequence: More and more page operators recognize the bad performance of banners and change to alternative advertising spaces which they can sell. The magic word is called “context-sensitive recommendations” or as they say: Content Marketing.

What banners don’t do anymore is replaced by content and personal relationships. Less is more and quality more important than ever.

Content Marketing means Recommending instead of Persuading

The first kind of content marketing which is getting closest to the current marketing conception originates from the year 2004. It was Microsoft who then established the first corporate blog with the title “Channel 2”.

Since then loads has happened. Content marketing has evolved to not only being a blog but engages in many forms with the user and the costumer, as with guest-article, sponsored posts or via storytelling as seen in Medium for example. Particularly sponsored posts are more loved than ever, even though I am not entirely convinced by this format anymore. Advertorials which are editorial appearing articles with the mere target to create conversions appear everywhere in the web.

But there is one problem. Such bought articles can have an explosive, urgent force for some time, but eventually they tumble down very rapidly due to newer posts and loose with that any direct attention. It is more of an impulse giver rather than a continuous converter (as long as no random SEO-success appears).

A note on the side: To offer a do-follow link in exchange with money means a breach of the Google guidelines and runs into the danger of being blocked by a manual action.

The most important aspect for an affiliate is to create regular recommendations rather than single impulses.

Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate programs are available like sand on the beach and according to my opinion some are actually really great. The most popular compensation types are Pay per Click (PPC), Pay per Lead (PPL) or Pay per Sale (PPS). The paid amount of the provider depends on how well one expresses recommendations and how well one manages to draw costumers. From my point of view two aspects are essential:

It has to be a really great product which is being recommended. The recommender (affiliate) has to be convinced of the product which he uses ideally himself.

As an affiliate, one is responsible for how much or how little earnings are drawn. The good affiliates get more, the others less.

For any enterprise this kind of marketing is extremely attractive since only with due success a provision is to be paid. In other words: No risks involved. Admittedly I am not recommending advertising enterprises to partner with affiliate networks, since quality suffers significantly exactly at this point. I have experienced this myself.

But how do you manage to produce regular recommendations if banners drop out and posts and social media recommendations promise short success only?

The Sustainable Solution: the Affiliate Shop

At a first instant that might sounds rather strange (you are not offering a shop but a blog) but the solution of the problem is a shop which actually does not sell anything but only recommends. At a first glance it looks like a real shop but the “buy” button does not bring the customer to his shopping basket but rather via the affiliate link to the actual and external shop, f.ex. Amazon, Zalando, etc.

Successful and good examples are thewirecutter.com, thisiswhyImbroke.com, and downcomforterguide.com. At all three examples one does not shop with the provider, the affiliate, but gets transferred forward to the actual seller’s site. These are classic affiliate shops.

An affiliate shop has two important advantages to a “real” shop:

The entire processing and logistics falls away. This means you can absolutely concentrate on the marketing and focus on creating traffic. You can give your visitor the opportunity to move around your shop and around the familiar environment of your website without creating the feel as if the visitor is being followed by advertisement.

The basics for such a shop are great affiliate deals but these have to be made first. The Amazon affiliate program is a good starting point in case of emergencies and one receives up to 10% provision as an affiliate.

The Way to My Own Affiliate Shop

I am showing right here in a concrete example how to build your own affiliate shop.

The foundation for a solid affiliate shop could either be an independent WordPress installation or a shop-expansion in an already existing blog or webpage. Following the WordPress installation set up the free ‘WooCommerce Plugin‘ and decide on the shop theme.

Once these basic steps for the establishment of a blog are complete the adding of the products can begin. Go to the menu and choose “products” and the further submenu choice “add a product”. A new and empty product mask is opening up. The title can be added, a long and a short product description as well as product pictures.

The crucial step only appears now: To turn your product into an affiliate product you have to set the product type to “external / affiliate product”.

With that step the product data mask changes; the price, the affiliate link and an individual button text (f.ex. “To the shop”) can be set. Save it and set up is complete. The product should now be seen in the shop.

Affiliate Shop on the Basis of PPC or Flat Rate Billing

If a small affiliate shop is set up, than I can recommend FastBill for the billing process. Agree with the merchant a price per click or a set price and count the clicks with a Plugin like Pretty Link. Once a month a bill is established with FastBill and sent to your merchant, settling all affiliate sales.

If the shop is bigger and carries many thousands of products from various merchants then things turn out to be more complicated. But with our second product FastBill Automatic also a huge affiliate shop can be settled without difficulties. Simply transfer the clicks via the API to FastBill Automatic and sales are automatically calculated once a month. If help is required, please contact me and my team at any time.

If simply the links to the affiliate programs are used instead of a click-deal, invoicing is not applicable to the affiliate shop keeper. In this case the affiliate shop receives a credit note from the seller (f.ex. from Amazon) and it can be added as income to the books.

Why Affiliates should be the Best Friend of Enterprises and Businesses

Each business has one problem: Where to generate (good) traffic and how to scale it! Google and Facebook are great channels of advertisement but even there limits are quickly reached. That’s why particularly niche providers who cannot or choose not to invest millions into TV-adds can benefit from affiliate deals. The aimed target customer is easily reached without major problems via blogs and content sites and in correlation with affiliate shops.

4 tips for Affiliate Shops

Even if from a technical point of view everything is perfect you still ought to take care of some things with the affiliate shop:",https://medium.com/lets-see-what-works/how-to-earn-long-term-commissions-with-an-affiliate-shop-e15c19d04f58,['Christian Häfner'],2015-08-29 17:26:15.755000+00:00,"['Affiliate Marketing', 'Blogging', 'Passive Income']"
Horses & Stables,"The highway buzzed and rolled softly, caught somewhere between the low crash of a distant ocean wave and the annoying squawk of a honking horn. The truck drove heavily, dragging the horse trailer behind it like a lumbering train. She watched her older brother grip the steering wheel, and pretended that with every subtle twist and every press of the pedal he was guiding them into distant space. She leaned against the passenger window and stared at her funny, distorted reflection in the wing mirror. But her own expressions grew boring and dispirited, and she turned her eyes to the massive trailer dragging along behind them.

“How much longer?” She asked.

“Hour. Gotta stop for gas soon, though.”

Cecilia gazed back out the window, her thoughts wrapped up in the intricacies of loading the horse into the trailer. Her brother showed her how it worked, how to get Evendim loaded and secure.

But Evendim radiated a stubborn, almost bitter fear, with every tap of the rope on his side. She’d watched the entire prolonged episode, all six hours of her frustrated brother swearing and fighting to get Evendim into the trailer. He’d started at ten in the morning and struggled for hours, until he spat out one glory of a curse word, one that she’d never heard before, and threw the ropes on the muddied drive. He stormed into the kitchen, tracking mud all over the floors, and sat to wolf down a meager lunch before trying again to coax the stubborn equine. She crept into the kitchen, and sat across from him as he ate in bitter silence.

“There are videos, on the internet, of horses. Showing how to load them.”

“Not gonna work,” he huffed, his mouth full of lunch. “Fucking horse is a brick.”

He chewed angrily, and stared out the window, as if he’d said the words to himself only. His temper faded, sluggishly, and as he finished, he turned to her.

“If you were a horse, you wouldn’t do that, would you?”

“Do what?”

“Take two hours to get on a trailer.”

“No,” she muttered, soured and confused.

“Good.”

He stood and put his plate in the sink. He’d tromped outside again to the drive, and spent the next several hours coaxing and swearing until the horse finally boarded the trailer.

Cecilia’s phone rang loudly, cutting through the low, monotonous hum of interstate traffic. She looked at the screen and muted it.

“It was mom, wasn’t it?” he said.

“No,” she lied.

“Just because she left, doesn’t…” He drifted off. “You gotta talk to her eventually.”

She smirked, making another one of those funny, distorted faces, only this time, without the mirror.

“You can’t keep ignoring her.”

“Yeah, I can.”

“Well, you shouldn’t.”

“You shouldn’t keep pressuring me.”

Almost as a response, he pulled the truck off at the next exit and into a glowing Exxon station. The bright lights overhead were flocked and muted with moths, and Cecilia peered over the door at the splotches of years of gasoline waste. She let her eyes wander, further, past the gas station and the awkwardly placed restaurant. Acres and acres of dark, roaming pasture extended behind the tacky roadside fueling stations, the comfort stops and the unbecoming billboards.

“Be right back.”

He stepped down, and walked across the wide lot to the storefront.

A tentative curiosity sprouted in her thoughts, and she turned around in her chair to look at the massive equestrian trailer. She opened the door and hopped down. She stepped — cautiously, quietly — to the back of the trailer.

She gripped the trailer door lock, and swung it around, releasing the clasp. She hesitated, but just for a moment.

She let the door fall to the grimy concrete, and the horse stepped out, slowly at first, then at all once. The horse hesitated, but like her, only for a moment. It galloped forward.

And was gone.

Cecilia tapped her phone, and called her mother.",https://medium.com/a-story-each-day/horses-stables-9bd6337cf16,['A Story Each Day'],2015-12-01 01:21:59.890000+00:00,"['Short Story', 'Fiction', 'A Story Each Day']"
Gender Identity Laws Endanger our Children and Support Sex Offenders,"By El Contra Bermudez

Houston (Texas, believe it or not) is voting to make it illegal to deny “transgenders” access to public bathrooms based on their “gender identity”.

That means if you’re at a restaurant and some creepy dude wants to use the women’s room, it’s illegal to deny him access as long as he “identifies” as a woman. If you’re 10 year old daughter is in there, tough shit. You have no right to place her safety above the “civil rights” of men who think (or say they think) they’re a chick. He’s going in and you can’t do a damn thing to stop him.

Seriously, do you want this alone in the bathroom with you daughter so it can “feel” good about its “gender fluidity”?

Some gender fluid guy who definitely does not need to be in a public bathroom with my 15 year old daughter

This proposition is so obviously ridiculous it’s hard to even describe it in words, but there are enough raving liberal nut jobs out there that it will get votes. If you live in Houston, here’s some sound advice to hopefully motivate you to get out there in November and VOTE NO ON PROP 1.

From Stopsexoffenders.com (obviously a right wing conspiracy site),

Parents have unknowingly sent their children into potentially dangerous situations. We like to think of our world as mostly safe, with only a few potentially dangerous situations from which to steer clear. But today’s world is not like the world when we were children. We cannot let our children walk home from school alone or play in the nearby woods without fear. We can’t even let them play unsupervised in a video game arcade or allow the teenager down the street to baby-sit without carefully following up on personal references. From baby-sitters to public bathrooms, parents have unwittingly helped their children to be victimized. One devastated grandmother told us a story of how a trusted male family friend, who often baby-sat her grandson, was found to have been abusing the child at every opportunity. Public restrooms are among the most dangerous places you can send a child alone. It gives child molesters easy access to their victims, the privacy to commit their act, and the ability to get out and get lost in a crowd. (One side note about public restrooms: In a report from a Dallas policeman, one of the local gang initiation rites involved waiting in a mall bathroom for the next young boy to walk in alone and then cut off his penis; the next boy to walk in was eight years old.) The bottom line: parents today have to take every precaution to ensure that their children’s safety and innocence is not compromised in a world that can be less than kind.

Help stop this madness and share this post. Respond to #HERO on Twitter and make sure our children’s safety comes before the cause of enabling mental illness.

Won’t have to run through the jungle

And scuff up your feet

You’ll just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day

You’ll be as happy as a monkey in a monkey tree

You’re all gonna be an American

Part I

God Is Alive and Well, Shaking Hands With The Masses in The Center Of The Pleasure Peninsula

I’ve never seen so many fat people in my entire life. They’re everywhere. And I mean fat. Not overweight, husky, big-boned, hearty, well-fed, or chubby. These people are morbidly, insanely obese. Some of these fatties are so fuckin’ fat, it makes me think America should outlaw XXXL clothing. Whatever. It’s a lost cause. Keep eating, fatty. And if you can’t beat them, join them.

The World’s Largest McDonalds is located on International Drive in Orlando, Florida. Two stories tall, the building juts gracefully out of the ground like a Roman cathedral. Inside, even more similarities exist: intricate murals, high ceilings, statues depicting saintly figures like Sir Ronald himself and the often-forgotten Moon-Face-Man. And yes, a divine presence can be felt throughout the McDonalds, perhaps even Roy Crock himself. Although I doubt it.

I ordered a number three and paid $5.34. As I ate by the indoor grotto, mossy from lack of care and attention, I watched this chubby, crew cut kid in a red T-shirt force-feed dollar bills into the token machine. This kid was barefoot and looked like the offspring of some incestuous union between The World’s Ugliest Man and The World’s Stupidest Woman. Or something far worse. As I watched this mutant child struggle with the last crinkled bill, which the machine kept rejecting, I was surprised by my lack of compassion. Usually, when I see such creatures, lame dogs, blind rats, road-kill, a tinge of empathy sparks in my heart. For this monster I felt nothing. I hated him and consequently hated myself. He took the crumpled, endlessly rejected dollar bill, and rubbed it against the edge of the machine like his father had undoubtedly taught him to do if the machine refuses the bill. Well, at least he’s learned that much. Maybe there’s hope.

With one more bite, I finished eating my quarter-pound of beef, beef from the carcasses of 1,000 different cows. I then exchanged a dollar for tokens and followed the chubby child monster up the stairs to the second floor. At the summit, placed high upon a pedestal like some ancient relic, was a sculpture: Earth, in the hands of Ronald McDonald. This is truth; this is the horrific, unyielding truth. I played Missile Command and ignored the fear. Every single cell in my body was screaming for me to run. No, we mustn’t run from the truth, no matter how painful.

And what is pain anyway? Alienation? Embarrassment? Yes, that too. Pain is being stared at. Pain is knowing that no one wants you here. Pain is watching a child skip with glee until she sees you and stops, stuck to the pavement, paralyzed by, if not fear, at least an utter lack of comprehension. People like me don’t belong in Disney World. I could see it in the eyes of every terrified child who looked at me, every disgruntled face of every parent who passed in front of me, every ride operator who glared at me as if to say, “Why are you ruining it for everyone else?”

Stuck somewhere between childhood and parenthood, I felt ashamed. It’s true; I didn’t belong. I know the secrets; the magic doesn’t work on me. The men in cartoon suits do not entertain me. I know the rabbit from Alice In Wonderland isn’t taking a break to drink some carrot juice. He’s smoking a cigarette, savoring it, making it last as long as possible before he returns to work, a job in which he surrenders his voice, his face, his identity and signs children’s autograph books purchased from one of innumerable gift shops carefully placed throughout the Magic Kingdom. Now, that is pain. Lord, hear our prayer.

In this place, Walt Disney is God: unseen, yet omnipotent. This is the Holy Land. Do you believe? Yes, it is A Small World. Yes, Dreams Do Come True. Yes, I would like Fries With That. This is the new religion. Disney gives people hope. Disney quells their fears, reveals their ultimate desires, and holds them to a code of ethics that may rock the very foundation of reality. But without faith, what does one have? Without faith, one is lost in a sea of hedonism, debauchery and dissoluteness.

PART II

Unbridled Fascism Amidst A Utopian Underworld Where The Women Are Scornful And The Drinks Are Anything But Free

Before I left for Orlando I bought three packs of Polaroid film and a pack of condoms. The cashier looked at me knowingly, assuming I was about to partake in acts of sexual perversion suitable for documentation only with Polaroids. I wish. I just wanted to be prepared. Isn’t that the Boy Scout’s Motto? It’s good that children are taught to be prepared, taught to expect the unexpected at such a young age. Youth is a fertile field, not unlike Mesopotamia. And like Mesopotamia, years past, youth gives way to hostility and war. To which I say, “Fuck ‘em if they can’t take a joke.” To which the authorities reply, “Come with us, son.”

You see, Celebration is a community, owned by Disney, a master-planned community of which the master plan was to create a town not unlike those dreamt up by Sherwood Anderson or Harper Lee or Tim Burton.

Photo by Mike Force

Established in 1994, Celebration is meant to be a refuge, an ultimate repression of all things bad. This town was constructed to be the quintessential feel-good town of both yesteryear and today. The citizens of Celebration embody the self-perceptions of The Best Country In The World: supremacy, righteousness, and piety. Their uniforms say it all: pastel pink T-shirts, khaki shorts, Birkenstocks with socks. These Americans wear fanny-packs and ride Segways. These Americans go camping every summer and return to tell how great it was to spend a week with “No TV, No Nothing.”

And this was the ultimate celebration: the eighth anniversary; Founder’s Day Weekend. Tables and tents representing all the local restaurants were set up throughout the Town Square. A stage had been erected, and finale of fireworks was planned. Children and parents alike, the whole town really, came out for the festival. The excitement was tangible. It may as well have been Christmas.

I was terrified.

Mike had wandered off into town and I stayed behind at the Town Square to document The Celebration.

In front of the stage where some cover band was playing, and everyone was singing “Celebrate! Celebrate! Dance to the music!” I stood videotaping everything: the band, the shops, the fat nuclear families eating paella, and two Oscella County Sheriffs approaching me, still approaching me, ordering me to turn off the camera and come with them.

“What’s the problem?” I asked.

“Just come with us,” the one with the gray mustache said, placing a hand on my back, leading me around the corner, away from the anniversary party. As soon as were out of sight, the other Sheriff, the shorter one with a shaved head, snatched my camera and launched into the interrogation:

“What are you doing here?”

“I’m here to investigate freedom,” I replied, with pupils dilated. I still had the foul taste of dried fungus in my mouth and with the sudden absence of joy and music, the drugs were beginning to win.

“But why are you here?”

I was silent. These men wanted no answers. They would believe nothing. Their faces turned from stern to suspicious to bloodthirsty. I was going down.

“You say you’re from New York but you have a Washington state ID.”

“Yes.”

“So what are you doing in Florida?” The sheriff asked, dropping his palm on the butt of his gun. The other one finally figured out how to work the video camera and was reviewing my footage.

“Look,” I said, watching the whole scene from the air, ignoring the insects crawling up my back. “I know I look a little different, I know — ”

“Sir, we don’t care what you look like. We have a lot of different looking people in our community.”

“Then what exactly is the problem?” I asked.

“Just calm down, sir.”

I stood there as hatred and fear radiated off these men: their uniforms starched and flat-chested, decorated with a dozen autocratic ornaments, their bellies kept off their crotches by belts holding medieval weaponry, the likes of which I had never seen. If they searched me and found what I was hiding, there would be no hesitation.

“Just to let you know, sir,” said the soldier with the camera. “You’re free to leave at any time. We are not detaining you.”

“Then I’m leaving,” I said, open-palmed, waiting for my camera.

“Well, sir, for the time being we do have possession of your camera.”

“I’m not leaving without my camera.”

“Then you’re going to have to wait.”

“So I am being detained.”

“Just calm down, sir.”

The distant party thrived and my paranoia grew. Certainly I wasn’t the only person in Celebration with a video camera. Had someone tipped them off? Were these sheriffs merely stalling until the rest of their boys showed up? And what then? What would happen to the bearded, dreadlocked, college student when the cavalry arrived? I imagined the worst: a hazing with broomsticks, coerced Russian roulette, simple crucifixion, perhaps a filthy snuff film with me as the star.

“Were you taping the children?” the mustache asked.

“What?”

Suddenly the sheriff’s walky-talky squawked some code that assuredly suggested my background check had come up clean. Ten-four.

The sheriff handed me my camera. “You’re going back to the festival, right?”

“I was thinking about walking around the neighborhood and getting some foot — ”

“Why don’t you just head back into town.”

“Okay.”

“Thanks for your cooperation.”

Back at the party, the band was leading a Wax-On, Wax-Off line-dance to the song “Car Wash.” I bought another beer and sat at a table near a foursome of elderly men in knee socks. Just drink your beer and smile. Smile, I told myself. Smile.

It was time to retreat. Mike and I left Celebration as the fireworks boomed on the horizon. We followed the pristine sidewalk of Celebration Avenue, crossed Celebration Boulevard, and headed towards the freeway, towards true civilization.

“I wonder if they’re any animals living in there,” Mike said, pointing at the swampy overgrowth past the white picket fence along the sidewalk. There, clinging to the trunk of a tree was a mammoth raccoon. Mike and I both stopped and stared, saying nothing. The raccoon stared right back. I smiled at the creature, illuminated by the distant pyrotechnics: first red, then blue.

“Did you enjoy your stay in Celebration?” The raccoon said, laughing like a maniacal Yoda. “Ya’ll come back now, ya hear?”

PART III

The Rise and Fall of Many Great Men and Women On Their Way To Something Greater

Tomorrow Land, home of Space Mountain, the Carousel of Progress, and The Time Keeper, is not the Tomorrow Land of Today. No, this is your parents’ Tomorrow Land. This is a cold vision of steel and iron, lasers and surveillance. After you disembark the Space Mountain coaster, all signs point towards a moving walkway that parades everyone past a series of televisions airing live-feed from hidden cameras aimed directly at your head. Sorry, Walt. I’m not impressed; I see myself on camera everyday.

There I am on television at the bodega, the liquor store, the bank, the bagel store, even the elevator. This is nothing new. But maybe something else is at play here. Where are the other cameras?

I saw not one camera in all the rest of Disney World. There were no cameras in any of the gift shops, no cameras in line for any of the other rides. No need for surveillance in The Happiest Place On Earth, no need for cameras where The Magic Lives.

Illustration by Mike Force

Yeah, right. Disney World is the Supreme Casino, responsible for the happiness of a multitude of disillusioned internationals and domestics alike. Fourteen million people visited The Magic Kingdom last year. You damn right they have cameras. Everywhere. Hidden; yet omnipotent. Walt, you seedy fuck.

The reckless capitalism of Disney and all its Worlds and Lands has spread like herpes throughout all of Metropolitan Orlando. And International Drive is the sickest of them all. Puss-filled, infectious sores line both sides of I-Drive: Denny’s across the street from Congo River Gold God Volcano Golf Island; next to IHOP is The World’s Largest Gift Shop with 1,000 Gifts For $1.99; then there’s Magical Midway, Sizzler, McDonalds, Dairy Queen, Burger King, Ripley’s Believe It Or Not, Wet N Wild Water Park, and finally, at the far end of International, amidst a cluster of palm trees, lies Skull Kingdom.

“I think it’s worth it,” said the fat Goth girl selling tickets to Skull Kingdom.

“Do you like living in Orlando?”

“I hate it.”

“You hate it?”

“I hate it.”

Tourism is the largest employer in Metro Orlando, accounting for 27.1% of the jobs in the community. The annual earned wages of direct tourism industry employees reached $2.9 billion in 2002. The admission price for the Magic Kingdom is fifty-five dollars. During our stay in Orlando, Mike and I paid for all of it, all of it but the airfare. Pratt paid for our airplane tickets, the first success of our Freedom Quest.

And yes, this quest was a success. We met our objectives: McDonald’s, Magic Kingdom, Celebration. We immersed ourselves, somewhat unwillingly, in the homogenous culture of Orlando. We dove straight into the blinding mouth of commerce and tourism and came out relatively unscathed. But had we seen it all? Was our mission complete? No. There was one more location, one more idea we had yet to explore. All our efforts would be in vain if we didn’t mingle with the truth-sayers, the domestics, the factory-workers, the beasts who run this whole operation… the locals.

Let me set the scene: Downtown Orlando is one sprawling tittie-bar. And you don’t have to tip. The clubs and bars are stuffed with Disney employees ready to get laid, desperate for someone to give them just a little happiness. In men, this is displayed by coy smiles and gelled hair. In women: boobs, lots of boobs; cleavage, erect nipples, I saw at least three girls wearing only a tube-top and suspenders. Everyone looked like a B-grade porn star.

I began to think Mike and I had made a mistake. These beasts looked hungry. And I was starving.

Hotdog vendors, thank God for hot dog vendors. Second only to a cabdriver, a hotdog vendor is the single best source for information, a contemporary oracle.

“Where’s the hot spot?” Mike asked the vendor as he fixed us our dogs.

“Uh, well…”

“Look at us,” I told the vendor. “Look at me, now look at Mike, now look back at me.” I paused for effect. “Now, what bar should we go to?”

“The Bar-B-Q Bar,” said the vendor.

Three hours, five tequila shots, seven beers, and two failed seductions later, the bars all closed and mayhem filled the streets. We decided to flee and hailed down the first gypsy cab to cross our path: a van, labeled simply, “Orlando Transportation.”

“Can you take us to International?”

“Sure,” the driver said. “As long as you don’t mind riding with these kids, I got to drop them off first.”

So we climbed inside and the four local college students were happy to share their booze and pot with us. The driver sampled a little too. Rage Against The Machine blasted from the speakers and everyone talked at once. It took almost an hour for us to reach the locals’ destination, some suburban house, somewhere off the freeway. Everyone jumped out, we said our good-byes, and before climbing back in the van Mike and I urinated on their front lawn.

Mike passed out as soon as we reached the freeway and the driver and I smoked more pot as he talked about how similar the situation in Iraq is to the Vietnam War. He talked about how it was better to work for yourself and he talked about home, Chicago.

“When’d you move to Orlando?” I asked.

“Six years ago,” he said. “I came to visit and just never went back.”

I was silent.

The driver glanced at me over his shoulder. He looked like a rabid Bloodhound and had only four giant, square teeth. “Where are you from?” he asked.

I told him New York, told him about The Prattler, and our mission, and my altercation with the law in Celebration, and suddenly we were at the hotel. I woke Mike and paid the driver and as we stepped out of the van, the driver called out.

“Listen,” he said. “People like you and me, we’re different. We look a little different, and people are always going to suspect us, think we can’t do something, think we’re doing something wrong. Ignore that shit. People are always going to judge you for not having their ethics. Fuck that. Just remember you’re not wrong; you’re just different.”

PART IV

Fathers of Freedom, Mothers of Homogeny, Children of Capitalism, Unite:

This Is Only The Beginning Of The End

The next time I visit Disney World, I may be a father. That thought scares the living shit out of me. But you know what? It might not be so bad. Children and adults alike stared at the sky above Cinderella Castle during the climactic fireworks show to conclude another day at The Magic Kingdom. Each face shared the same expression: uncontrived happiness. And I was no exception. When Mike and I entered the Magic Kingdom, we were foreigners, drug-addled cynics, contemporary artists in search of whatever Happiness we could find, all in the name of Freedom. But then, as a fiery Mickey Mouse head sparkled red and gold in the sky over the castle, something changed.

All the capitalism, all the homogeny, all the exploitation, the bigotry, the corruption, the repression, none of that bothered me; none of that mattered anymore. All of that evil was trumped by the collective happiness of each and every family during the fireworks show. It was a beautiful sight: communal bliss. And I was a part of it.

Happiness is a funny thing: fleeting, ephemeral, often superficial. And freedom the same.

On the airplane back to New York, everyone has their toys: camel-shaped guns, plastic eagles, reflective tiaras. All I have is a plastic bag full of half-empty bottles of rum and vodka and tequila, a full bottle of red wine stolen from Black Angus, and champagne, champagne Mike and I were saving to celebrate our return, our survival. Yes, we did it. We ventured to the pleasure peninsula, headed straight for the dazzling light that is the Magic Kingdom, the Happiest Place On Earth. And now, as our plane taxis on the runway these children slobber on their trinkets and toys as if the taste will postpone their departure. Well, children, it will. As will this rum. May we all choke on The Spirit of Disney as the plane touches down in New York.",https://medium.com/welcome-to-the-land-of-cannibalistic-horses/two-men-of-gentle-means-visit-the-happiest-place-on-earth-512687ae02cb,['Andy P.

"50,000 new users in day; How we built a product from scratch to handle scale.","The 18th of September, 2013, started off like any other day. Soundwave was now live for two months. Technically we had a flawless launch. Of course there were UI bugs and features that needed improving but from an architecture point of view it was a home run. We knew iOS7 was going live that day and we were ready. We were so confident in Apple’s new OS that we had rebuilt our iOS app solely for iOS7,dropping iOS6 fully in the process. Ballzy move. iOS7’s UI was such a drastic change we placed a bet on a massive early uptake. The bet paid off (thanks @bboyle18).

Excited by the release of our new iOS7 build we all had gathered in the office. Apples release was in the evening (Irish time) so work had ceased for the day. We had our Data Dog dashboards (@datadog) up and running as we patiently waited.

Right on time, Apple being punctual as ever, we began to see movement on our realtime graphs. One of the benefits of putting time into internals metrics development (thanks Dave @DavefromDublin and Clodagh @ClodaRgh). Users were starting to update to our new app. Unexpectantly we began to see a lift in registrations. We put it down to extra activity in the App store due to users upgrading their OS. We thought it would level off . We were wrong. The registrations kept coming.

50,000 downlaods in one day

It was then we spotted the reason for the surge in activations. Apple had placed us smack bang on the front of the app store. We flicked through the different stores; Ireland, UK, America, Japan, Germany. We were featured in all on what I can only assume was one of the busiest days ever on the App Store.

“I think iOS 7 is the biggest day in technology ever. “There’s never been another day like this in the history of the universe where hundreds of millions of people will see a big change to something that they’re used to” — Phil Libin, CEO, Evernote

We had the honour of being placed in the “Designed for iOS 7” banner beside Run Keeper and Evernote as well as their “Best New Apps” section of the App Store.

Soundwave Appstore “Designed for iOS7 feature”

Over a 24 hour period more than 50,000 new users had registered for Soundwave. This usage was on top of an already active user base. We were handling a couple of hundred API calls per second. Not too shabby. To handle this load, we scaled horizontally, adding extra instances to our Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure but that was all we needed to do. One of the scaling decisions Dave had made was not to depend on autoscaling. This put more dependancy on us to scale when required but gave us more visibility on performance. Most prefer to have autoscaling on from the start but I still stand by our decision. Handling that scale from a standing start is no mean feat and we did it with ease. Once the numbers started to settle we were able to scale vertically by adding the correct “bigger” boxes to handle the activity. Some may think the time has come where web services like AWS have taken the complexity out of scaling (to the size we cater for) but they are wrong. The complexities and nuances of building something to scale are still very much there. This article does not get into the hidden complexities like idempotent updates, relaxing ACID, multi-threaded design, distributed queues. If you are after these details checkout our articles on metrics, our metrics engine and our map. These tend to be the stories in a sprint that seem to be inconsequential and underwhelming to the success of your product whereas in fact the knowledgable out there know they are the stories that will keep your ship afloat. Dave championed these stories and had us ready when they were required. Here I will outline the three key pillars as I see them to conquering scale:

The Team; The Process; The Architecture.

The Team

Before we put together our engineering team we surrounded ourselves with tech advisors. People who had been there before and had the battle scars to prove it. Our key advisor was Paddy Benson (@pbenson), skilled in building tech teams and scaling product. We leaned heavily on his experience in building the right team. We had decided on the team size and the skillsets we needed. One of the key mindset changes was understanding that we were building a “Web Service” with an Android and iOS frontend (still native of course) rather than an Android and iOS app. The difference being that the key feature being built was the interaction between client (app) and server rather than features within the client app. This thinking focused our search when hiring the right team. We were not looking for Android or iOS engineers we were looking for full stack engineers with skills in Android, iOS and architecture.

We now had our team. Three full stack engineers (@davefromdublin, @bboyle18 and @Dockheas23). Dave highly skilled and experienced in architecture, Brian in iOS and George gifted at anything he touched that fancied the Android challenge. Although our engineers were full stack they were leaders in their field. They each had the autonomy to build their products how they wanted as long as it linked into the overall setup. Dave led all decisions on scale and reliability. If it fell over we would be looking to him. If it scaled it would be because of him. Brian built the iOS7 app and made sure the client adhered to the setup. His high quality builds got us featured multiple times by Apple. Check out his article here. George took the lead on what is now our ‘Editors Choice’ Android app. The Michelin star of Android development. Over the years we have continued to expand our engineering team with the same methodology, language agnostic full stack engineers. Take Clodagh (@ClodaRgh)for example. She has lead iOS development, our metrics engine, API and database designs, security decisions, and tackled problems from smoothing music playlists to iOS performance tuning to tough distributed concurrency bugs. This has allowed the team to grow, allowing no one to get siloed as the “only one that knows” and if we were to lose an engineer, multiple others were ready to take their seat (Bus Syndrome)

The Process

Being a small team it is very easy to fall into the trap of starting to build too early. Although we were always tinkering with prototypes and demos we didn’t begin to build our MVP until our development process was in place. Our engineers were experienced and we utilised this. We brought in, and embraced, Jira, Bitbucket, two week sprints, demos, estimates, code reviews, testing and later on continuous integration. As everyone says “our own form of Scrum”. As opposed to the others that don’t fully understand Scrum. We knew the rules and broke the ones we chose. We were ready to build.

We knew the ability to scale was going to be essential to the success of Soundwave. We also knew there would be no scale without the right product. These were our initial goals. Build a product that could scale but also build the right product. The first thing you learn in the start-up / product world is build lean. Excellent. We all now know to build your Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and get your learnings. What most people forget to mention is the unintentional foundations, that more than often are laid, when building your MVP. Architecture decisions when building your MVP are difficult to change; if not for technical reasons then due to time constraints. How our product was going to scale was almost certainly going to be consistent “irrelevant” of product changes. This was the section of the product we were going to build right first time.

The server needed to be able to communicate with the clients, ingest the data (asynchronous and synchronous) and make data available to the clients. Infrastructure and languages were discussed and locked down. For us AWS, MongoDB, Java, JSON, and native Android / iOS were our spine. Of course infrastructure could change vertically or horizontally and other languages were used for certain tasks but the core remained the same. Our foundation was set.

To learn what product we needed to build we worked lean. “Keep it simple stupid”. Before we launched we had over 800 beta users on our Android and iOS apps (Don’t tell Apple!). Building features, changing features, dumping features all happened over a three months period. None of this took from the stability we were building on the backend. We were ready to scale.

The Architecture

A picture paints a thousand words. Rather than show you our architecture independent of other touch points and items that take up our mental resources we put it all together in one diagram.

The key to our scaling capabilities lies in the skills of our team, Dave leading the scaling conversations with the others keeping him on his toes. Every move was discussed at length. We built strong relationships with the AWS (Declan Kavanagh)and MongoDB (@samuel_weaver, @MongoDB)teams, both were based in Dublin, Ireland. We learned from their other customers and used their teams to review what we had built. Both teams were amazingly open to conversations and more than happy to help. We repaid them wherever possible, usually by presenting at their conferences or being part of one of their panels.

Here is a quick (high level) explanation of the key components of our architecture:

ELB: The Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) controls all the requests coming in from our Android and iOS apps. If we add more machines to handle high loads the ELB makes sure the requests where shared across these machines.

Application Servers: The Application servers are the heart of our architecture. Written in Java and utilising Tomcat the Application layer ingests the data synchronously to our datastore MongoDB and asynchronously to our SQS queues.

SQS: Our SQS queues feed our roadies with data. They queue up any asynchronous work needed to be done by a roadie. If the roadies are under pressure it allows them breathing room by backing up the work.

Roadies: Our roadies are our workers. They are mainly used to populate data. Our primary roadie (play roadie) returns images, ISRCs, 30 second clips, etc for each song play captured. We also use the roadies for sending out notifications and for Business Intelligence. Essentially anything that can be done asynchronously is done by the roadies

MongoDB: MongoDB is our DBMS. Chosen for its geo features ( blogpost), its non relational structure and its ability to scale (once sharded). At the time of the iOS7 release we had yet to shard.

Summary

We were able to scale to 50,000 new users in a day because of our three pillars; team, process and architecture. Employing the Lean mentality is great to find Product Market Fit (PMF) but make sure you know the potential consequences. If you don’t architect your product right from the start know you are building “a house without a foundation”.",https://medium.com/soundwave-stories/50-000-new-users-in-day-how-we-built-a-product-from-scratch-to-handle-scale-f2b468d09270,['Aidan Sliney'],2015-09-08 09:12:39.060000+00:00,"['Software', 'Scale', 'Startup']"
16 Ideas for Creative Revenue and Community Engagement in Journalism,"In early April four major reports were released that address the intersection of local journalism, revenue sustainability and community engagement. Below are excerpts from the reports, drawing out the key lessons and findings from each. While the focus on a number of these reports is nonprofit journalism, the clear and actionable recommendations included below are relevant to any newsroom.

Sustainable Strategies: Lessons From a Year at The Texas Tribune

Professor Jake Batsell spent a year inside the Texas Tribune studying their business model and traveling the country talking with other newsrooms about their revenue strategies. His report from this year-long study were just released. They key question he tackled was “Can the Texas Tribune model be replicated?” And he admits that while unique circumstances have helped the Texas Tribune thrive there is still a lot any news organization can learn from their approach. Here are the four lessons he shares:

Persistent focus on revenue diversity — “News ventures that allow themselves to remain dependent on one or two streams of income are leaving themselves dangerously vulnerable.”

— “News ventures that allow themselves to remain dependent on one or two streams of income are leaving themselves dangerously vulnerable.” Entrepreneurial creativity and customization — “The Tribune has been relentless in unearthing new ways to pay for its journalism.”

— “The Tribune has been relentless in unearthing new ways to pay for its journalism.” A knack for converting local sensibilities into revenue — Figure out what the unique character of your area is and how to build experiences around it.

— Figure out what the unique character of your area is and how to build experiences around it. A tireless champion and fundraiser-in-chief — News organizations needs bold leadership and chief evangelist with personality, visibility and connections.

— News organizations needs bold leadership and chief evangelist with personality, visibility and connections. A shared sense of editorial and business mission — “The newsroom and business side have developed a mutual sense of trust underpinned by the Tribune’s nonprofit mission.”

Batsell’s report also includes useful sections on best practices in revenue strategies including: Sponsorships and underwriting, Events, Memberships, Philanthropy and Supplementary revenue streams like syndication, crowdfunding and monetizing data sets.

Gaining Ground: How Nonprofit News Ventures Seek Sustainability

Gaining Ground is the third report from the Knight Foundations local media initiative. In their conclusion they list these key takeaways, which focus on business planning, experimenting and building community:

Set business goals : “News ventures that have been intentional about their growth, including developing clear business plans and financial targets, have scaled their operations at a faster pace. For organizations to transition from surviving to thriving, they must spend more time planning for the future, not simply accounting for the present.”

: “News ventures that have been intentional about their growth, including developing clear business plans and financial targets, have scaled their operations at a faster pace. For organizations to transition from surviving to thriving, they must spend more time planning for the future, not simply accounting for the present.” Experiment with new services : “Too few organizations have seriously piloted new earned income strategies, but the few that have tried have experienced initial successes attracting new forms of income, from native advertising to sponsorships for events and webinars. Lasting viability for nonprofit news ventures will only come with reduced reliability on fickle philanthropic funding.”

: “Too few organizations have seriously piloted new earned income strategies, but the few that have tried have experienced initial successes attracting new forms of income, from native advertising to sponsorships for events and webinars. Lasting viability for nonprofit news ventures will only come with reduced reliability on fickle philanthropic funding.” Invest in capacity, not just content: “Most organizations continue to devote the lion’s share of their budgets to editorial expenses, the lifeblood of their day-to-day work. News ventures that have grown, though, have consciously invested in future-oriented competencies, such as full-time staff in development and technical innovation, to increase engagement with online content.”

“Most organizations continue to devote the lion’s share of their budgets to editorial expenses, the lifeblood of their day-to-day work. News ventures that have grown, though, have consciously invested in future-oriented competencies, such as full-time staff in development and technical innovation, to increase engagement with online content.” Transition from donor to membership model mentality : “Membership programs offers the promise of more sizeable and stable long-term funding from individual supporters and strengthens relationships with their audiences, making news ventures more keenly aware of community needs and more likely to engage audiences to have an impact.”

: “Membership programs offers the promise of more sizeable and stable long-term funding from individual supporters and strengthens relationships with their audiences, making news ventures more keenly aware of community needs and more likely to engage audiences to have an impact.” Plan for impact: “Nonprofits leading the way when it comes to capturing and communicating impact identify clear reporting objectives and ways they will measure those objectives from the outset.”

They also list the 6 revenue models that news organizations included in the study have been developing:

In-person events : “Corporations or institutions that pay to be associated with events hosted by the nonprofit news organization”

: “Corporations or institutions that pay to be associated with events hosted by the nonprofit news organization” Advertising : “Corporations or institutions that purchase banner or display ads on the nonprofit news site”

: “Corporations or institutions that purchase banner or display ads on the nonprofit news site” Sponsorship : “Corporations or institutions that pay to associate their brand with the content of the nonprofit news organization”

: “Corporations or institutions that pay to associate their brand with the content of the nonprofit news organization” Syndication : “Content sold to other organizations for republication”

: “Content sold to other organizations for republication” Training : “Training courses sold on investigative reporting techniques”

: “Training courses sold on investigative reporting techniques” Subscribers: “Individual subscriptions sold to specialty publications”

Creating Stickier News: What You Don’t Know About Web Traffic Might Hurt You

Professor Mathew Hindman, a fellow at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center, released new research looking at how the attention and ad dollars that news gets (or more precisely, doesn’t get) online.

“Stickiness… measures how likely users are to visit, and how often they go beyond the first click to the second or third. Sites with above-average stickiness grow their audience… those with below-average stickiness shrink. […] The problem of stickiness, of generating compounded audience growth, is the most urgent problem facing journalism today. If journalism needs an audience to succeed, then most digital publications are failing.” Nieman Lab has a good overview of the findings where they highlight this quote from Hindman’s paper:

“The bottom line is that any successful strategy for digital local news requires sites to grow their audience. This is obviously true for sites relying on ad revenue — though local newspaper sites cannot expect the same level of ad revenue per person that larger websites earn. Audience growth is just as essential for plans that rely on selling subscriptions. The current core audience of local news sites is too small to provide digital sustainability. Visitors who spend just a few minutes a month on a site are not good subscriber prospects. Even nonprofit journalism efforts need to demonstrate that their work is reaching a broad audience in order to ensure continued funding.”

Hindman offers some solutions. He writes: “Doing better requires newspapers to think differently about Web traffic. Newspapers need to invest heavily in measurement and online experiments. Just as important, they need to rethink what they are optimizing for: not raw traffic, but audience growth. Small gains in stickiness can compound enormously over time.” There is much more in the paper, which you can download here (PDF link).

U.S. Smartphone Use in 2015

The Pew Research Center released a major new study on smartphone use in the U.S. which had some specific findings about smartphones and news. From the report: “A substantial majority of smartphone owners use their phone to follow along with news events near and far, and to share details of local happenings with others:”

“68% of smartphone owners use their phone at least occasionally to follow along with breaking news events, with 33% saying that they do this frequently.”

“67% use their phone to share pictures, videos, or commentary about events happening in their community, with 35% doing so frequently.”

“56% use their phone at least occasionally to learn about community events or activities, with 18% doing this frequently.”

“Each of these behaviors is common across a diverse group of smartphone owners,” wrote the researchers. “Mobile news consumption is common even among older smartphone owners, who tend to use these devices for more basic activities. Four-in-ten smartphone owners ages 65 and older use their phone at least occasionally to keep up with breaking news, half use it to share information about local happenings, and one-third use it to stay abreast of events and activities in their community.”",https://medium.com/the-engaged-journalism-lab/16-ideas-for-creative-revenue-and-community-engagement-in-journalism-cc37846a6d2f,['Josh Stearns'],2015-04-14 17:58:17.342000+00:00,"['Sustainability', 'Journalism', 'Community Engagement']"

Israel’s Netanyahu and a broken taboo,"By Harvey Morris

The golden rule of Israeli politics has always been to avoid any public spat with the Americans.

The theory was that the electorate would punish any politician who endangered the country’s relationship with its closest and most powerful ally.

Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s three-times prime minister, appears to have broken the rule and got away with it, winning re-election on March 17 and the chance to form a governing coalition headed by his Likud party.

Netanyahu had broken a taboo by accepting an invitation from President Barack Obama’s Republican opponents to address the U.S. Congress, using the occasion to criticize the administration’s Middle East policies.

Obama is having none of it.

In the last moments of the election campaign, he rejected the international consensus on the creation a Palestinian state, which is the keystone of U.S. policy in the region.

Since the election, Netanyahu has sought to row back on that, but Obama is having none of it.

“We take him at his word that it [Palestinian statehood] wouldn't happen during his prime ministership,” the president said in an interview, “and so that’s why we've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don’t see a chaotic situation in the region.”

It was a harsh put-down from the leader of a country that is often portrayed as unquestioningly supporting any policy the Israelis choose to pursue.

No automatic support

It is true that the U.S. invariably vetoes any attempts to sanction Israeli in international forums such as the United Nations. But American officials defend that stance on the basis that nothing must be done to disrupt the chances of an Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement built on a two-state solution.

The implication of Obama’s latest comments is that Israel can no longer automatically depend on such diplomatic support.

The intimate relationship between the two countries dates back to 1960s when Washington concluded that increased Soviet military support for Arab states that opposed Israel was upsetting the balance of power in the Middle East.

That led to a closer U.S. alignment with Israel, which was to seize a wide swathe of Arab territory in a six-day war in 1967.

That territory included the Gaza Strip, previously administered by Egypt, and the West Bank, previously under Jordan’s control.

Both were inhabited by Palestinians, among them those who had fled their homes in a war that followed Israel’s declaration of statehood in 1948.

The tail that wags the dog?

In the decades after 1967, an international consensus emerged that the solution to the conflict was the creation of a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank. It was eventually endorsed by both Israel and the Palestinians.

A popular view of the U.S.-Israeli relationship, particularly among the people of the Middle East, is as an overarching American-Zionist conspiracy to control the region. Israel is often caricatured as the tail that wags the American dog.

The reality is much more subtle.

The two sides have often been at odds in the past, with Washington opposing the building of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land and trying to restrain its military response to Palestinian attacks.

However, these disputes have been kept deliberately low-key. In public, at least, the U.S. has always stood up for Israel.

This time, however, the dispute is out in the open. Netanyahu has defied the American president on the issue of Palestinian statehood and has publicly criticized his efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran, something the Israeli leader rejects outright.

At the end of the day, the U.S. first and foremost looks to its own interests in the Middle East rather than those of Israel, although it may often look as if the reverse is true.

The Distance of 365 Days,"A year ago today, a Polaroid photograph was taken of me wearing a pink lycra and spandex bandage mini-dress. I only got to see it once but I remember being pleasantly surprised that even though I smiled big, my face hadn’t scrunched up and away from the kind of sex appeal I sought in this particular case. The photo was to go in my file as I auditioned for a job at a strip club in midtown Manhattan that I desperately did not want to take but would have been devastated if it wasn’t offered to me. I always did best when I smiled big because it made the men there think I was really having a good time. I passed muster and began work that very night. I took this photo earlier in the day when I was practicing at home:

I was owed thousands of dollars in freelance money, mostly from copywriting jobs and a handful of low-paid media ones when I ran out of Abilify, an anti-psychotic drug that I use to treat bipolar disorder. Uninsured and sinking into a depressive state, I stared down the $880 price and knew that even if all the jobs I applied to called and made offers, I wouldn’t see money for another two weeks at least. And those jobs weren’t calling anyway. Abilify wouldn’t be generic for another six months and I could see myself slipping into the same suicidal despair that put me in Bellevue the year prior before that happened. But I can walk into a strip club and start making money that same day and so that’s what I did.

After my audition, I was in the dressing room getting more glammed up for my shift than was required to audition and a bubbly day shift blond in an American flag bandana approached me. She said, “Didn’t you just audition? It’s my first day too. You’re gonna do great cause there are like, no American girls and guys really like us. So you’ll do awesome!” She skipped out the door and on her way, apparently unaware of the dozen or so Russian women sitting around getting ready whose value she dismissed and made me look like a similarly over-confident slimeball.

One woman with long black hair, a thick Russian accent, and an ass that could solve the Euro Crisis kept staring in the mirror as she put on her make-up and said, “Somebody thinks she’s better than everyone else, hmmmm,” in an ominous sing-song way that I remain certain was a curse on both me and Bandana Jones because it was the worst club experience of my life. The night I quit, zero men tipped me after their lap dances that night, I had been thrown on the ground by a Norwegian man expecting a hand job on the dance floor, my tongue had swelled up and I had a fever of 103 from a nutritional deficiency I had developed from bad hours and bad eating trying to find a straight job and work at the club at the same time. I went home and just never bothered to show up again.

It was a year ago today that I started at a club in an industry I didn’t want to work in anymore. Today, I am in Paris writing my first book, a collection I sold to a Big Five publisher imprint for a generous sum with the help of an incredible agent and an insanely supportive and nurturing editor. I was hired at a major media company and left it when I realized it wasn’t for me. I started reporting science and technology stories when I thought I’d write personal essays forever. I fell in love and out again. I bought a fancy mattress and might buy a house in the Catskills in the next year. I’ve written stories that resonate with people enough that they send me very kind emails telling me that I should keep writing but that say to me, “You deserve to live,” which it is sometimes hard to say to myself.

The point of all this is not that I escaped the snares of the lurid adult industry and lived happily ever and to not become a stripper because someone might put a hex on you. The problem was not that I was a stripper but that I was unhappy being one at that particular juncture in my life. And as a writer now, I still get stories rejected and I get profoundly mean emails from readers and I still have to take Abilify so I don’t surrender to the alluring whispers from the Brooklyn Bridge that I could always just jump if the weight of myself got too much to carry around.

I just want people to know that a year is not the blink of an eye we are so often told it is because it feels like a lifetime ago that I was on that stage in that pink dress. I want people to know that they should remove the “just” from, “I’ll just stick it out another year” when they stay in jobs and cities and relationships they have the means but not the will to leave. There is nothing small or insignificant about a single year when you’re using every minute of it to claw your way out of whatever dull ache or crushing boredom or entrenched despair is plaguing you. If I had never gone into that club, I would not have made the money I needed to get my Abilify that gave me the stability and energy to follow up more assertively after job interviews and land the job that generated the kind of attention and opportunities I needed to get where I am today. That is Paris, by the way, if I hadn’t mentioned before what a cozy little bitch I am being right now.

When I got home tonight, I took this photo of myself in a black bodycon dress from American Apparel. I am not smiling big in it not because I am unhappy but because I think I look most like myself when my smile is at half-mast, not having to convince anyone what a good time I’m really having.

I struggle with BPD. Why my mental illness does not define…,"While overproduction of the thyroid hormone can give you a goiter, overproduction of the neurotransmitter cortisol frequently puts my body into fight-or-flight mode.

Maybe you have asthma. You’ll understand what it’s like to have a hyperactive immune system which reacts to harmless substances in the environment. It’s frustrating, isn’t it?

It’s equally tormenting for me when my amygdala (a brain structure) produces irrational responses to my surroundings.

It’s not only improper to define a person by his/her illness but potentially injurious.

Society and its ignorance are hurting the people who struggle with mental illnesses, learning disabilities and neuropsychiatric disorders.

I know, because for the longest time, I couldn’t remember that I had an identity beyond my disorders. The people I chose to share my struggles with, told me that I was “manufacturing my depression”. Borderline Personality Disorder defined my personality, which meant that it was ingrained into my existence, right? I couldn’t exist outside the spectral remains of my Post-traumatic Stress disorder since it held so much of yesterday.

I don’t need society to reinforce my identity-crisis.

The first step to recovery is acknowledging that sickness has an external causal agent. If all you see in your life is the disease, you become the disease, until you can’t fight it anymore.

And, when you’re fighting yourself, everyone knows that you’re losing the war.

I’m that girl who rebelliously resists the over-rated phenomenon called growing up, the kid who is way too ambitious for her own good, and the adult who spends entirely too much time overthinking things.

Ugh, I have so many problems besides a mental illness!

I suffer from Recurrent Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. But essentially, I have better things to do with my life than be sick.

Empathy in beauty,"As the week of Tiferet energy winds down and we begin the transition into the world of Netzach, the combination of Hod of Tiferet gives us an opportunity to reflect, and ensure that our definition of beauty continues to vibrate from our highest selves- rejecting, for example the way our society objectifies women, by ascribing beauty to them only in terms of their physical attractiveness.

The notion of “beauty is in the eyes of the beholder” is both an inaccurate and demeaning gauge of beauty.

The energy of Hod- empathy helps to elevate us as we search for appropriate ways to siphon off from the beauty that floats around us, and direct it into the flow our own lives, by reminding us, that joy to be found in outer beauty is short-lived and is akin to stealing something that doesn’t belong to you.

To look at a person without seeing them through the tinted windows of ones own persona is to learn to let go, and see them as they see themselves.

This is not just the rule for discovering true Beauty in each other. It holds true for the discovery, and experiencing of the beauty lurking in the corners of our lives, and in the nooks and crannies, in the “cleft of the rock” of all our human and planetary experience.

Hod of Tiferet — helps us understand that the light of all the beauty in this world begins to shine in us when we stop seeing everything that happens to us, from our limited human eyes- liberating us from the need to view our lives solely, from the one dimensional narrow straits of our perspective.

The step away from narcissism toward the genuine seeing of another, is also a leap of faith in the goodness to be found even in challenging times, and the goodness and true beauty to be found in the heart of the other, and the world around us.

An empathetic faithful hod step toward truly seeing an other is also a giant faithful step toward G-d as well.

A step toward the faith that we can and will be held, and warmly embraced by the goodness of the universe, a good that will be given, surrendering our fearful need to violently seize and take.

On the wings of Hod we soar from the earthly perspective of “beauty is in the eyes of the beholder,” upward to a heavenly perspective of “beauty is in the eyes of the beheld!”",https://medium.com/gender-justice-feminism/empathy-in-beauty-108e86397e6b,['Yossi Lipsker'],2015-04-22 12:34:23.799000+00:00,"['Beauty', 'Empathy', 'Judaism']"
How licence free pictures really affect your blog and where to find them,"There are blogs entirely without and others that crush the reader with it: pictures!

After working without pictures on this blog, I have begun to add them since some weeks. It was not only one comment in my last article but also the expected effect. I am using pictures in all blogs now but to various outcomes. The right choice of pictures for a blog is not that simple after all. Which motive? Which price? Licence free pictures or rather buy them? What format? As easy as it is to create a blog, just as complicated it can get with pictures. The topic of pictures in blogs opens up many questions which I look at systematically here and which I will answer from my own experience. From the choice of the right picture, to the platforms where good pictures are found, to the measureable outcomes, I will discuss all of that in this article.

One thing in advance: Some outcomes are actually really surprising!

A picture tells more than a thousand words

This quote transfers more content than initially conceived. The majority of pictures in social networks can be processed by our brain within only a few milliseconds. But somewhere is a limit. Besides the atmosphere a picture always delivers also emotions and information which we partly and unconsciously internalize, that in extension changes our reading habits, only to give one example. The article picture therefore has the intention to prepare the reader to the text and to adjust his basic attitude to it and to provide a better introduction. Also, the pictures should make you curious; pictures build up tension, so to convince the reader to click on the link to the article and in that way to learn more about the offered topic. Pictures are building bridges in between expectation and outcome. This aspect is particularly important within social media marketing but more to that later.

First we need to look at another question, if we want to understand why pictures create effect: How do we perceive a picture? Doctors at the University of Münster, Germany, have found in a research project that reviews to some extent the ‘picture superiority effect’ in collaboration with marketing experts and concludes the following: the brain turns off areas of reason when familiar brands show up and at the same time brain areas of emotional and instinctive action turn more active. A sign that peoples brains respond to certain familiar pictures and reflexively execute actions which stand in relation to it.

What does that knowledge mean in the blog environment?

The brand pictures are the article pictures and the reflexive execution matches with the click on the article link. If we offer the reader a picture which touches him emotionally or thematically, the chances that he will click the link are certainly increasing. So far I could have brought in this understanding myself. A further interesting reality is that we retain information of things six times better if they are read in context with a picture. If you offer your reader a (memorable, not just any) picture to your article, he will remember your blog, your article, and therefore yourself much longer. This precious information can provide you with a real advantage in times of the blogger-flood.

Pictures make noise and animate areas in the brain which convey the feeling of familiarity. The effect on the reader is clarified with that. But do pictures help to actually increase the reach? I have reviewed the effects in detail and evaluated amazing findings.

Facebook: Are pictures really increasing organic reach?

People get interested with pictures but with machines this looks rather different. We all know web-pages that draw attention with lurid headlines and support those with catchy pictures (heftig.co is a real go goer for that in Germany). It is exactly this effect that Facebook tries to counter act upon in preference of grounds for qualitative journalism. But the same effect can also be a role model to all: one headline that draws curiosity and a relating emotional picture to suit the message. If qualitative content would follow, also Facebook would do nothing about it.

Over the last years social media experts in my environment pointed out to me more than once that posts with pictures create a far better reach. That stood true for quite some time. At this point timelines and newsfeeds of users are bursting from the seams because they are crammed-full with pictures that often force and pose to build tension or frantically struggle for likes and clicks. It is a pity but a measureable outcome that we have to act upon.

I can derive the observation that Facebook is clogged up with pictures by taking a small sample from our FastBill — Fan page.

All data stands in relation to posts from the last three months and are aimed to deliver a small overview on the organic reach of our posts.

The astonishing outcome of my 10 minute analysis

The included links to posts always refer via a short link to the FastBill Blog and offer an added value.

It is clearly visible that the articles without pictures (besides one exception) reach an irregular but consistently higher range. This is followed by articles with a link-preview, spreading only very erratic. The articles with a text link and picture can hardly gain any reach and change only marginally in the lower value ranges.

The result shows that posts with link and without picture work, in this case for FastBill the best.

Be your own social media adviser! Sometimes you are your own best social media adviser! Analyses like above takes no more than 10 minutes and deliver insightful findings about your fans and your audience. Focus yourself on the best functioning kind of posts on your page.

Sources for qualitative and licence free pictures

To use pictures in posts and on the blog one has to find them first. To create them oneself is surely the best and most cost effective variation but as an entrepreneur we think efficiently. It is even simpler to make a brief search, download or buy. 20 Dollar for a picture is still cheaper than a one hour outdoor shooting with a handful of people. At the same time you benefit from the variety of picture-data-banks which you hardly have anywhere else. On the other hand you run into the danger that a picture you used appears somewhere else as well (just happened to me recently). In spite of this risk I decide to buy pictures or to download licence free pictures. Here are some resources which I am using for my blogs myself:

Picjumbo.com Picjumbo offers free and much licences free pictures which can be used commercially or private. The page is sponsored by advertisements and offers besides the free picture download also an option to sponsor, bringing you “into the Hall of Fame.” You can request to get the latest pictures sent to you via e-mail.

Littlevisuals.co Seven pictures every seven days. This is the system with which Little Visuals functions. Besides the free of charge download of the package on the web-site you can receive those also via e-mail. The majority of pictures are naturalistic, some jewels guaranteed within.

Unsplash.com Unsplash — a real insider tip. Brilliant pictures and motives which are not common stock and nevertheless available for free (free of charge and licence free). Every ten days one gets ten pictures — on request also via e-mail.

Deathtothestockphoto.com You wish for the death of the stock photos? They can reach that since their pictures are of highest quality. The makers of deathtothestockphoto.com deliver fresh pictures once a month via e-mail, which are bound to be found in many popular magazines. Free of charge!

Stocksy.com Stock pictures don’t have the best name. Often words like “simple” “boring” or “posed” come to surface. Stocksy brings that to an end. Besides standard stock motives you also find more offbeat motives. Often the coercion of payment and the not always cheap pricing from stock portals come under question. In my case, I do look at every post also as an investment towards my own visible presence and the increase in reach. If I compare the effectiveness of one blog post with other payable methods than 10 Dollars seem like nothing and add an appealing and suitable picture. Even 20 Dollars for the format which you require on Facebook is from my point of view very acceptable.

Everything that is law: the copyright

In principle always name the creator!

That does not necessarily reflect the legal situation but shows decency and appreciation. The majority of the stated sources above offer licence free, which means free to use pictures. Mostly even without stating the name. In order to communicate picture rights more clearly the Creative Commons (CC) Licence was called into life. Different symbols inform about the possibility of utilization and the joint responsibilities. You can find an overview of the symbols, the different ways of how the ownership has to be identified here.

The choice of the right picture is essential

Of course particularly pay attention to one thing: the motive. It has to suit the story in the text and the feeling of the blog. It should transfer the mood accordingly and should not be too fragmented, so that readers clearly grasp the representation.

Create an experience with every picture and make sure your readers acknowledge that each one is an “editor’s pick.” Plan in the necessary time for the picture research and avoid rushing your choice. This time is a good investment.

Also try to maintain your style that creates harmony between your pictures and is agreeable to the overall picture of your blog. Your readers will benefit from the clearly established structure and will like to remember your blog with that disposition.

The picture format

Besides the theme of your blog it is mainly Facebook and Google that specify the required format of your pictures. Here are the formats at a glance: • Facebook (http://www.jonloomer.com/2014/01/20/facebook-image-dimensions/) • Google+ (http://purrfectlysocial.co.uk/new-google-image-sizes/) • Twitter and further information on Facebook and Google+ (http://postcron.com/en/blog/social-media-image-dimensions-sizes/)

Practical tip: Currently I choose pictures that suit the Facebook format for the timeline (1200 x 627px). It also fits nicely into the formats of other networks. Should there be any problem with one of your pictures it is very important to build in a fallback picture. For WordPress blogs this can be read here. It is the fallback picture that is being delivered in case no other one can be found.

My findings

Article pictures and pictures in social media networks can increase the reach, but they don’t have to. In any case they do have an effect on your reader and how he is taking up your post. As in my case, for LSWW, I am going to continue working with pictures on Facebook. On the long run I will maintain the strategy: “The mix does it.”",https://medium.com/lets-see-what-works/how-licence-free-pictures-really-affect-your-blog-and-where-to-find-them-15e97a6a3a7c,['Christian Häfner'],2015-08-29 17:13:07.141000+00:00,"['Creative Commons', 'Marketing', 'Blogging']"
You know Airbnb right? There is one for 3D printers!,"No, 3D printers are not looking for apartments (we aren’t there.. yet). I mean it in the sense that there is a website allowing you to rent 3D printers around the world from owners who are not using them full-time! How cool is this idea?

I had no clue something like this existed until a couple of months ago when friend Mac from Austin, Texas, introduced me by email to Nikki, based in NYC. He wrote:

Nikki, Hydra is an 8-week entreprenership camp in Chile focused on solving

global problems by taking a hacker approach at building successful

startups. I am being brought in to teach as their 3D printing leader.

http://hydra.exosphe.re/ Niccolo, 3D Hubs is a great business that brokers people who need 3D

printing services with nearby enterprising 3D printer operators. This

allows anyone who owns a printer to find local production opportunities. Nikki Finnemore is 3D Hubs Community Manager and I think it would be cool if we can collaborate with them.

https://www.3dhubs.com/

I’ve to be honest, when I read the description of 3D Hubs as a “business that brokers people who need 3D printing services with nearby enterprising 3D printer operators” I did not jump. When I opened their website I did. And when I google it I did again. “The Airbnb for 3D Printing” definetely puts it on a better light.

That’s how 3D Hubs founders Bram de Zwart and Brian Garret defined their vision back in 2013 when they started the company in Amsterdam. One year later they wrote a Medium post about the lessons learned from building a global 3D printing network. Worth reading, I personally really loved the story behind lesson 4. Start with offline before going online. The importance of offline is something we stress a lot at Exosphere because too many aspiring entrepreneurs do not even take into consideration while building their mvp and strategy.

Designing for Empathy and Retention,"“We need to understand what will delight people, and then go out and find the technology or business model to make that happen.” — Blaise Bertrand

Partner and Industrial Design Director, Blaise Bertrand, explains it’s a designer’s responsibility to “Zoom In and Zoom Out,” viewing problems from “the millimeter to the kilometer”

IDEO wants everything from chairs to cellphone accessories to connect with their audience on an emotional level. What makes IDEO such a successful product development firm lies in the difference between “Tech Push” and “Tech Pull.”

Tech Push:

“Many companies invent the technology, and then try to push it into the world regardless of the market or users.” — Blaise Bertrand

Tech Pull:

Only after IDEO designers fully understand and empathize with a problem do they investigate the software and hardware necessary to create an effective solution.

Understanding the problem always starts with researching the audience, but it’s not about “just talking to people.” IDEO designers go to extreme lengths to experience problems firsthand before they start concepting solutions.

How far are they willing to go? Once, an IDEO designer researching how to improve hospital visits, admitted himself into the ER and recorded the entire experience. The resulting video showed how much time patients spend looking up at boring ceiling tiles — a unique perspective you wouldn’t think of until experiencing the environment for yourself. “Experiencing it develops empathy,” Blaise explained, “which leads to innovation.”",https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/designing-for-empathy-and-retention-c8f69b22ddf1,['Ryan Scott'],2015-12-18 18:25:49.009000+00:00,"['Design', 'Ideo', 'Events']"
Buridan’s Ice Cream,"Brianna’s mother led her through the grocery store, dodging in and out of aisles and displays. Her shopping cart grew crowded and full. Brianna watched as her mother grabbed a gallon of milk and added it to the cart. Her mother turned to her and pointed to the one empty spot in the cart.

“You want to pick something out?”

Brianna nodded.

“Alright. Go pick out some ice cream and meet me up at the checkout counter. Pick something good!”

Brianna’s mother pushed the cart toward the front of the store. Brianna watched her disappear.

Brianna wandered past the meat section, the dessert section, the dairy department, and the bakery. She wandered to the frozen cabinets of ice cream, stacked and poised, like a library of desserts. She opened the freezer door. Coils of icy vapor billowed and rose. The plethora of flavors presented themselves to her, vying like rivals for her attention.

Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry. Those were good ones, but she always got those. Cookies & Cream, Cookie Dough, Salted Caramel, Mint Chocolate Chip. Those were good, too. Candy Bar, Chocolate Chunk, Cherry Surprise, Banana Pudding, Birthday Cake, Peanut Brittle, Brownie, Cotton Candy, S’mores, Peanut Butter Cup. She sorted through them, one by one, reaching through the vapor and into the frozen shelf, grabbing a container, turning it around and reading the sugary ingredients.

The aisle grew colder and colder, and Brianna shivered and let go of the carton of Banana Split ice cream. Her teeth chattered and the door slammed shut. She took a step back, with indecision hesitance, and hugged her arms close to her body. Her eyes wandered to the surrounding shelves, and grew wide against the cold air. She took a step back, overwhelmed by the endless possibility of choices.

Berry Blast, Apple Pie, Pecan Crunch, Rocky Road, Mocha Fudge, Cinnamon, Waffle Cone, Peach Cobbler, Pineapple, Cherry Almond, Pistachio, Orange Sherbet, Cappuccino, Lemon Meringue, and —

“Brianna!”

She tore her eyes away from the icy shelves and glanced down the aisle. Her mother ran toward her.

“Brianna. What’s going on? I’ve already checked out. Come on!”

“But I haven’t chosen one yet.”

“Well, maybe we’ll get one next time. You missed your chance, sweetie.”

Writing better AJAX,"Chaining works, just as usual

Even better: assign the $.ajax() method to a variable, for which you can chain promise callbacks to. Chaining has always been a hallmark of jQuery, which allows one to reuse a cached selector, for example. In this case, the $.ajax() method returns a promise object natively, which we can use for chaining, too:

See that how the .done() callback is on the same level as the AJAX call itself, without requiring complicated nesting within the call per se? While this advantage may seem trival on a cursory glance, it greatly improves the readability of your code, especially in a production environment where your code is likely to be cluttered with multiple asynchronous calls.

It also allows you to inject code between the AJAX call itself and resolving the promise delivered by the call, allowing for greater flexibility in coding.

In other words, you can see that promises and deferred objects, implemented since jQuery v1.5 onwards, in relation to synchronicity of code execution, is akin to event bubbling in the DOM, listened on by the .on() method.",https://medium.com/coding-design/writing-better-ajax-8ee4a7fb95f,['Terry Mun'],2015-05-08 11:02:04.042000+00:00,"['Web Development', 'Jquery', 'Ajax']"

My name is Emanuel. I am 35. I was sent to prison three times in my life, each time in my home country, Eritrea. I was imprisoned because I asked questions I wasn’t supposed to ask, and talked about ideas I wasn’t supposed to talk about: ideas such as personal liberty, freedom of expression and democracy.

I asked questions about why people in Eritrea are forcibly conscripted to the army and why we have only one political party, one TV channel and one radio station.

The third time I was imprisoned, I was held in an underground jail for two years and three weeks. There were 18 people with me in the cell. Seven of us came out alive. I was 36 kilograms (around 80lbs) when I came out. But I survived.

Then I ran away.

Fortunately, I am not one of around 7,000 Eritreans in Israel who suffered horrific torture and rape at the hands of traffickers in the Sinai Peninsula on their way to Israel.

Class of 2010

I chose Eureka College when I was in high school simply for the fact that I could play football there. I wanted to go somewhere that I could play as an incoming freshman and make an impact. This decision would prove to be a very important and rewarding one throughout the next four years.

To recount single stories, or point to just one time that sticks out in my mind, is very difficult. From being around great teammates everyday, working hard for the chance to celebrate victories with friends and coaches, to simply being able to greet each member of the faculty and supporting staff at EC and having them greet me by name, I can tell you that I truly enjoyed every single day that I was at EC.

What makes Eureka special to me is something I did not realize until after I graduated. The feeling I get when I head back to a football game, or when I see past coaches, professors, etc., is one of a kind. The memories I have when I walk through The Reagan Center or the memories when I see the football field are very dear to me. To this day, I can vividly remember most of Coach Sweitzer’s classes. Some were good, like the examples she gives that make you crack up, laughing; and some were bad, such as when she handed back an Exercise Physiology test, but all were enjoyable for a reason I cannot quite put a finger on. I can also still tell you to never choose letter “C” for an answer in Dr. Logsdon’s Western Civ class.

I can say what most would say and call Eureka a “great” place. However, it’s more than that. Eureka is about personal relationships with staff and friends; it’s about the feeling I get when heading into town. It’s these and all of the things I have mentioned that truly make Eureka College “special.”",https://medium.com/studs-terkel-project/nick-lindsey-72eb5451526a,['Eureka College Alumni'],2015-10-30 13:54:36.324000+00:00,"['Alumni', 'Eureka College']"
10 Instagram Marketing Hacks for People with 0 Followers,"I recently launched my Instagram marketing course on Udemy and I am really excited to see a lot of positive feedback. However, at least 3 of my students asked this same question

“I am a newbie on Instagram, how do I get my first 100 followers”.

I totally get it, because no one likes a ghost town. If you have 0 followers on Instagram, why would anyone follow you. Right? So here is a list of growth hacks (or tasks) you can use to get your first 100 (or close) followers.

1) Complete your Instagram bio. Make sure you add your keywords and Hashtags in the bio.

2) Use an awesome profile image (not the one from your Tinder profile)

If you are a brand, use your logo as a profile image

If you have a personal account, use your headshot

3) Post at least 9 awesome photos. No one wants to come to an empty house.

4) Search and follow at least 25 relevant Instagram accounts. e.g. I would search “#SocialMedia” and follow the first 25 accounts.

5) Like at least 25 relevant photos

6) Comment on at least 25 photos and “good pic” or “great profile” does not count. Be thoughtful!

7) Invite your Facebook friends to like your Instagram profile. Go to Instagram settings for this.

8) Follow people from your contact list & Facebook friends. Some of these will follow you back. Head back to Instagram setting to get this done.

9) Post your Instagram profile on other social media channels (Twitter, Pinterest etc.)

10) Text your friends and ask them to follow you on Instagram. Yes — your mom, brother, sister and ex also count. Most of them will be more than happy to connect with you on Instagram.

Now that you have at least 100 (or close) followers on Instagram you can start working on the strategies I discussed in my course. e.g.

Forms With A Human Approach,"When writing forms, make everything crystal clear. For example, when asking for their address, make sure they know which one to provide as a shipping address and as a billing address if there is a difference. Also, if you want them to provide an address associated with their credit card, tell them. Sometimes this, and other kinds of information like error notes, confirmations and success messages, is useful to provide. When doing it, be nice to people. Thank them in your confirmation message, write clear error messages or warn people nicely, like “there are only 2 pieces of this color left”. Details matter and these small messages are also part of the site and brand personality. They have to follow the same tone and voice, no matter what the message is.

When you invite people to answer your survey, create an enticing subject line. People have a tendency of wanting to help, so tell them you want their opinion. Say, for example, “Have 2 minutes? We’d love your feedback!” In your invitation, be friendly and offer vital details: how long the survey will last and when is the deadline? Offer a clear Call-to-Action. Use a warm greeting and thank them You may want to include the confidentiality information and how the data will be used. Tell why the survey and their opinion is important. Aim for a survey that takes under 5 minutes to complete. Tell people who they can contact with questions.

Double-check the copy and links before sending the invite. After a few days, you can send a reminder to those not yet answered. When the form is complete, say goodbye. Don’t leave people hanging. Tell them the form was sent successfully and, if applicable, tell when someone will respond to them. You can link to your homepage from the thank you page or give the option to share the survey. After collecting and analysing the all the data, use it to make informed decisions when moving forward.

When asking people to subscribe to your newsletter, be short and clear. What’s the value? What’s What you offer in return for their email address? You can also provide people a preview of a newsletter or link to an archive. Showing social proof, how many people have already signed up, is very effective.

If you are creating a signup form, you don’t have to ask for the password twice. Instead, let people see what they typed. And instead of a CAPTCHA, use double opt-in. You can get creative with signup forms, too. One interesting idea is to use a narrative format: “My name is ____ and my email is _____ . I’d like my username to be ____ and my password ______ .”

Samuel Hulick has great onboarding examples and reviews on his site Useronboard that are worth to check out.

Begin with a few non-threatening and interesting items. People generally look at the first few questions before deciding whether or not to complete the survey. The “don’t know” option is for factual questions and when there is any possibility that the respondent may not know the answer to the question. It’s not good for attitude questions. For those, you can use “undecided” or “neutral” options.

You can apply the “choose your own adventure” methods to forms, too. For example, you can change the “contact us” form based on what the customer is interested in/worried about/etc. by using logic jumps. Or, if you send an invitation/RSVP, you can offer different questions based on the responder’s name, location or answers. When taking this approach, it’ll help to draw a “decision tree” or mind map with the different branches. By using hidden fields you can track referrals (with or without HTML), record extra information (where the person found the link) or further customise the experience.

A form can be a perfect way to tell people about your new project and ask for their input. Images, icons, videos and audio clips offer a nice experience and engage people. You can use them to tell your story and then ask people to share their ideas. This also works for case studies or even for job openings, allowing people to attach files like pictures, CVs, resumes, and so on.

Mapping the Intersection of Journalism and Civic Technology,"Is Journalism Itself A Civic Technology?

Jennifer Brandel:

I came away feeling excited that the work I’ve been doing with Curious Nation and Curious City does fit squarely in Laurenellen’s definition of civic tech, as well as community organizing, as those were both terms that never occurred to me to employ. One of the participants, Whitney May, shared a formula that got stuck in my craw: information + invitation = participation. It felt like the gathering was proof positive of that in action — by learning more about what civic tech means and can include, and being invited to identify with it and use that term, I feel far more likely to pay attention to and participate in other convenings / dialogues labeled as such.

information + invitation = participation

Jeremy Hay:

I was always turned off by the term civic journalism because contributing to and being a part of the civic fabric should already be a key thread in conscientious journalism practice. On the other hand, it’s exciting and seems particularly relevant these days — when technology has so revised journalism’s possibilities while at the same time disrupted its models — to think about civic tech being a strategy or approach used to further good journalism in a way that might also help stabilize and revitalize journalism as an institution.

So, as I came to think about it in Chicago, civic tech (in the context of journalism) is:

First an approach that can be used to effectively develop the framework and landscape of a journalistic endeavor — by using tech methods and tools to engage usefully with a community.

an approach that can be used to effectively develop the framework and landscape of a journalistic endeavor — by using tech methods and tools to engage usefully with a community. Second , civic tech can be the framework for a news outlet to engage with and remain usefully entwined with a community, both as an operating system and a beacon that helps maintain its purpose (just as truth and fairness and verification are). Basically, if a media organization consistently engages with the community, works with it to the extent that the community helps define the news and information needs it has that it needs the media organization to meet, that creates a value. That value is one that the media organization holds onto, that it strives to uphold, and then you’ve got a infrastructure of and for civic engagement that is built on an equal footing. That leads to the next:

That leads to the next: Third, it is a result, one in which a journalistic entity becomes self-consciously a part of the technological infrastructure serving a community.

Thinking about journalism as part of the civic infrastructure’s technology could be a useful way to conceive in contemporary terms of journalism’s actual role. Also, it would be more useful, I now believe, to think about civic tech as an approach to getting to where journalism is an organic aspect of a community’s technological civic infrastructure, rather than appending civic tech to journalism (i.e. as a new form or model of journalism called civic tech journalism or something like that, which just seems faddish and dilutes actual civic tech).

In other, plainer words, civic tech is not journalism, civic tech is an approach/method/set of practices that journalism should make good use of as it strives to situate itself civically and find viable and sustainable models. One good approach might be to come up with a set of principles influenced by civic tech that could be applied to journalism.",https://medium.com/the-engaged-journalism-lab/mapping-the-intersection-of-journalism-and-civic-technology-d5472c5c9cc9,['Josh Stearns'],2015-04-29 17:05:09.731000+00:00,"['Opengov', 'Journalism', 'Civictech', 'building journalism with communities']"
Was College Dean Wrong To Wear Arabic Ensemble To School Event?,"By: Cierra Bailey

A University of Oklahoma dean was called “culturally and ethnically insensitive” after wearing Arabic garb to a campus event which he says was meant to encourage diversity.

Dean of Architecture at the University of Oklahoma Charles Graham issued a public apology for wearing an Arabic robe and head covering (white thawb and red keffiyeh) to a back-to-school event last week.

Graham included in the apology that he bought the garments in Dubai and wore them out of multicultural respect. Furthermore, he said several Muslims he spoke to didn’t find his wearing the attire offensive.

Those who did express discomfort sent anonymous emails to the university president citing Graham’s actions as “culturally and ethnically insensitive.”

The executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations-Oklahoma, Adam Soltani, suspects that the underlying issue for those who sent complaints was that the clothing is associated with Muslims and the Middle East.

“I couldn’t imagine if he wore a Scottish kilt or German lederhosen that people would complain about it,” Soltani reportedly said. “I highly doubt they would complain if it were any other clothing that people didn’t associate with Middle Eastern and Islamic culture that is wrongly tied to minority extremist groups.”

Soltani attributes “heightened Islamophobia” in Oklahoma as one of the factors causing the biases against Islam and Muslims.

“It’s traditional Arab dress worn in the Middle East but people who are not Arab, including myself, wear this type of clothing just as there is Persian dress, African dress, Turkish dress and clothing worn in other places,” Soltani said. “Non-Muslims in the Middle East wear this type of clothing too.”

Graham insists the situation is not a matter of religion at all, but more about cultural sensitivity.

You be the judge. Does wearing attire associated with a certain culture promote diversity and acceptance or is it a form of cultural appropriation and insensitivity?

Outbreak Chronicles: New Valley,"Outbreak Chronicles: New Valley

Interview with G.P. James (and friends)

Mr. Gunther Percival James is the leader and founder of New Valley, a ‘protected compound’ located in north Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley. He brought two friends to the interview, Mr. Samuel Hillcrest and Ms. Jeanine Sanderson. Both live in the New Valley compound.

All interviews are video recorded and transcribed for accuracy.

Outbreak Chronicles Interviewer: Hello all, thank you for allowing me to come visit your… New Valley.

G.P. James: Oh, we’re always up for visitors, as long as you go through the proper channels in advance.

Jeanine Sanderson: Yes, plus it’s a good opportunity to really speak about the things we’re doing up at the estate.

OCI: What exactly do you consider New Valley? Is this just an estate? Or…?

GPJ: It’s a hybrid farm community, really.

Samuel Hillcrest: With a unique emphasis on protection and self-sufficiency.

GPJ: Correct. After what happened down in Los Angeles last fall, I thought “never again!” There’s just so many people down there, it’s a wonder we didn’t have a pandemic of that size before.

JS: Sammy and I were neighbors down in Mar Vista during the outbreak. So many died, but we just boarded up Sam’s apartment and waited it out. I’d already been stockpiling supplies in case of a massive earthquake, so we just transferred those to his place on the second floor and made a go of it.

SH: Not everyone was as lucky or prepared as us, though.

JS: G.P. can tell you what he went through…

GPJ: I was trapped on a roof for the better part of a week during the worst of the outbreak. You can still see a bit of sun damage on my neck here. I was damn lucky I had a hat… I never leave the house without one now.

OCI: How did you get trapped on a roof?

GPJ: Some damn idiot got bitten I’d imagine, I don’t really know how it all came to be. I was tending my front patio garden one day, then BANG BANG BANG. I hear some people beating on the wooden door we have that keeps the inner courtyard separate from the outside street area, right?

BANG BANG BANG. I knew it was infected. I could hear the yelling. I grabbed my go bag and me and Scout headed up to the roof —

JS: Scout is G.P.’s dog. Great dog. Part lab, part… what is his other part?

SH: Pitbull.

JS: That’s right. [Nodding.] Great dog.

GPJ: So we’re up on the roof, and I’m right as rain. Seven infected bust through the door. Two look pretty far gone, but the rest are newly… I don’t know what the term for it is. Turned?

OCI: That works.

GPJ: I figured they’d leave once they realized nobody was around to maim or eat or whatever the hell those monsters do. Or maybe I’d get lucky and some poor soul on the street would make enough noise to draw them out, but no! They were there for 5 damn days!

By the second day, two of them had just gone out. Like, you could tell they were on their last legs and just poof, died right there. It took a few more days for the others to wear down enough that Scout and me could sneak past.

Once all the government hoopla was over and done with, I sold my condo and bought a few acres up here. [Gestures widely.]

OCI: There’s at least ten of you that live up here, correct? How did you meet others with your same… passion. Err, goals?

SH: Craigslist, if you can believe it!

JS: There’s also a prepper forum I check on the regular, and G.P. had a posting there, as well. It seemed like kismet!

GPJ: I got a lot of bites, no pun intended there, but I was really interested in serious people who weren’t only looking for a place to hide, but a place to really make into a home. Jeanine was already advanced in disaster preparedness, so she was a no-brainer. Sammy here has a ton of survival skills, and we’ve also been teaching ourselves farming.

SH: We sure have, and it’s been pretty fun, despite the water setbacks.

GPJ: I can’t tell you how rewarding it’s been up here, learning how to live on our own. We still have internet and things, but it’s pretty spotty. Not super reliable. You have to go into town to get the good stuff.

OCI: How often do you guys leave the estate?

JS: Usually we make a trip out once a week. Saturdays are most common. We pick up some things we’re just not able to grow out here —

SH: Yet!

JS: Right, yet. Like coffee.

OCI: I noticed the fence when we drove in.

GPJ: Right, right. That’s part of our perimeter defenses. The infected can’t climb very well, not without assistance from like, the spaces in chain link fences and such. Eventually we want to reinforce the wood planks you see with metal crossbars, so they wouldn’t be able to topple the fence either.

OCI: So you are expecting another outbreak?

GPJ: Absolutely.

SH: It’s practically guaranteed at this point.

JS: We wouldn’t bother doing this otherwise.

SH: Though it is very fun learning how to do all this… stuff.

GPJ: Now that you’ve heard our sob stories, would you want to go on a tour of the grounds?

OCI: That would be lovely. Could we film it as well?

GPJ: Absolutely. We don’t have anything to hide. Besides, it’d be good to have the public at large see what we’re trying to build up here.

JS: It’s our goal to have everyone look into more self-sufficient ways of living.

SH: And protecting themselves come the next outbreak.

JS: Yes, that too. Definitely.

GPJ: Where to first, you think?

JS: The farms!

SH: The big house?

JS: The Cabin!

SH: We could visit the animals.

GPJ: Hmm, the Cabin is closest, we’ll start there.

The estate is four acres, but easily walkable. The sleeping quarters are housed in a large building the New Valley pioneers call the Cabin. There are bunks stacked two up along the walls, with plenty of room for more. Many of the bunks are decorated with photos or have personal trinkets on the nightstand. A few have pet beds or clothes trunks at the foot of them. There’s a washing station for clothing, and another that serves as a miniature bathroom.

GPJ: An outhouse is attached outside, but there’s indoor plumbing in the big house. That’s the big three story farmhouse looking thing you see when you come up the drive there.

OCI: Who lives in the big house?

GPJ: We did, before others moved here. Then we thought it better if we all bunked in the Cabin, so we converted the bedrooms to workrooms.

SH: We didn’t want to create an Us and Them dynamic on the grounds. So we all just sleep here. The bunks are actually really comfortable. We got these premium cushions for the mattresses in bulk. Pretty cheaply, too.

JS: We also bring a bunch of our fruits, veggies, and these homemade candles Annie makes from the beewax we collect to this farmer’s market every Thursday in NoHo.

GPJ: That helps offset some of the costs of the upkeep.

OCI: You have honey combs?

SH: Oh yeah. Bees, two horses, a few goats… oh, and Jeanine has two alpacas…

JS: I’m learning how to spin wool!

SH: …Six pigs, and god, too many chickens if you ask me.

GPJ: Sammy thinks they’re very loud. The chickens.

SH: And one bit me!

JS: But their eggs are the best breakfast.

SH: Your omelettes are the only reason I tolerate those little feathered monsters, Jeanine.

GPJ: Despite his dislike of the chickens, Sam built their coop with Bruce’s help. Bruce is another one of our Valley people. We really ought to come up with a name for us, shouldn’t we?

SH: I like Valleyers.

JS: Hm, that feels awkward in my mouth. What about Hill People?

SH: That makes us sound like mutants.

GPJ: What?

SH: Like, you know, The Hills Have Eyes?

OCI: Maybe just residents? Like the New Valley residents?

GPJ: I like that. It’s simple.

SH: But Hill People —

GPJ: We can take a vote later, Jeanine. Anyway, Bruce has been instrumental in helping us whip the old farmhouse into a proper lodging for the animals. Bruce is a carpenter.

SH: He used to work on the cabinetry for houses. He helped us improve the fence, too.

OCI: It seems like you all have a lovely place coming along out here.

GPJ: Thank you, that means quite a lot. We’re just ordinary folks making a go of it. We’re not some doomsday cult.

OCI: Have there been —

JS: We’ve been… visited —

SH: I’d call it harassed.

JS: Visited a few times by religious folks.

SH: The Mormons are fine, they’re at least polite. But its these militant Christian groups…

OCI: What are they after?

SH: Us to [air quotes] “accept Jesus and the end times” or some nonsense Look, me and God got a good, private, understanding…

JS: I’m just none too fond of any religion.

GPJ: We let people practice whatever they like here, we’re not some wacky cult. People just want to hate what they don’t understand.

JS: Like the Amish.

SH: Exactly.

JS: No, I mean, we’re kind of like the Amish.

OCI: I’m not sure they’re called Amish, technically —

SH: Oh yeah, I guess. But we wear jeans.

GPJ: I wouldn’t give up my denim for anything. Not even Jesus.

OCI: Right. So this building…

GPJ: This is the main house. [Indicates the three story farmhouse coming up on our right.] There’s a big kitchen where we make most of our meals. The chicken coop is just around here. This back door goes right out to the goats and chickens so we have easy access to them.

Jeanine and Maryann make breakfast most mornings, since they’re the best at it. Sam and I make lunch around noon, sometimes Annie or Bruce help. It’s not easy making food for ten people. [Laughs.] Then Sean, Ben and Dana make dinner. Jeremy doesn’t cook any of the meals, mainly because he would burn it all or set the house on fire, but he does collect all the ingredients for every meal —

SH: Which is quite the work just in and of itself, especially when we made that pumpkin pie.

JS: That pie was so good, though.

SH: Really good. The pumpkins were friggin’ heavy.

JS: Which is why Annie had Jeremy carry them for her.

GPJ: There’s also workrooms upstairs. A woodworking bench in the third bedroom… you can usually find Bruce there. We have an extremely rudimentary metal working area in the garage. It’s not actually… super safe in there unless you wear a lot of protective clothing.

We also have a craft room, where people can go to learn or make things like weavings or baskets or…

SH: Basket weaving. There is no underwater component, unfortunately. Yet.

JS: [Snorts.] It’s also a small library and game room. It’s mostly for just like, hanging out. There’s lots to do all over the grounds, but it’s also important to take time to just enjoy yourself. Otherwise you’ll go crazy.

GPJ: [Nodding.] Very true. Right, so, do you want to pet the alpacas?

OCI: I think I love this place. Sorry, I shouldn’t say that on the record. [Pause.] Nevermind, I’m not sorry. This place is awesome.

Every time Henry would listen for sounds coming from his neighbor’s rooms, pressing his ear against the cold, dark iron walls, he would only hear his own heartbeat. He knew he had neighbors, he just couldn’t hear or see them. J.P.’s side was on the left, where Henry’s desk sat, and Delilah’s side was on the right, next to Henry’s bed. They had all known each other for as long as any of them could remember. They were all coworkers, printing reports from their laser-etch typesetters, sending the reports and analyses through the pneumatic tube system for Management to look over at the end of the day. They all exercised at the same time every morning, 0730, facing the sunlight that streamed through the window slot near the ceiling, bending, stretching, running in place, making sure all of their joints were in working order. They’d eat their lavish meals that were delivered to them every day at 0900, 1330, and 1830 through the matter replicator machine. But they never saw each other. Henry could imagine them all perking up the same way he did when the cheerful jingle chirped out of the horn-shaped loudspeaker, and the cranking of the gears signifying that the replicator machine was about to spit out a meal. But he never saw them and they never saw him.

Despite these barriers, Henry liked J.P. and Delilah; they would communicate through the pneumatic tube system, sending letters laser-typed onto the reams of thick paper that never seemed to run out. Their letters would trade stories from their day, describe what sort of books they were reading, and share ideas about what the next day might bring. Sometimes Henry would just get a quick, “How are you?” with a smiley face, always from Delilah. He really liked her and frequently wished he could see her face, what she looked like. He also liked J.P., but in a different way. They usually played a guessing game about what report they’d have to file on a given day and whoever lost would have to draw the other one a picture of something the winner chose. J.P. and Delilah had other neighbors on either sides of them, but they rarely talked to them, mostly confiding in Henry. He always found himself wondering who was on the other side of these thick, iron walls, imagining what they looked like, how their voices sounded, and he was sure J.P. and Delilah were wondering the same thing.

One day, Henry came up with a plan. He would petition the Management to renovate the walls so they could see one another. Perhaps a window or a mail slot. Even a peep hole would suffice. He voiced his plan to Delilah and J.P. and they sent thrilled letters back. “Great idea!” and “Why didn’t I think of that? Why hasn’t anyone thought of this?” Henry quickly went to work, typing up a carefully-worded and polite request to Management and leaving room on the back for the signatures. He sent the petition to J.P. first, followed by a note instructing him to send it in his direction until it circled the floor with all the signatures. He was certain that other people on the floor felt the same way as he and his friends. Maybe even everyone in the Building felt the same way. This could change everything. When he finally received the petition again in his pneumatic tube, he saw that the back was crammed with signatures, and smiled when he saw that the last one was Delilah’s with a smiley-face next to it.

After weeks of waiting, Management finally decided to renovate. Henry woke early one day and noticed something different: his room was brighter. His ceiling was still the same, iron and corrugated, but he never noticed how ugly it was until that moment. He was wondering why he’d never noticed this before when he sensed movement to his right. He turned his head and the first thing he saw was a beautiful face. It smiled at him. He realized he was smiling too because he knew it was Delilah. He stared in silence for several more moments before sitting upright in bed and faced her, cross-legged. He slowly put his hand against the crystal-clear barrier between them and Delilah did the same and they began to laugh. There was a knock on the wall behind Henry and he turned to see a tall, lanky figure standing there, smiling at both of them. Delilah waved excitedly and Henry smiled. J.P. pointed at an unfamiliar device affixed to their transparent walls and then at their familiar loudspeaker systems. He walked over to his device and pressed a button, paused, and said one word: “Hello.”

They would talk every day while they were working and when they were finished. No rules had been established forbidding them from doing so, just simple instructions sent to them through the pneumatic tubes on how to use their new devices. Every day Henry woke up with new excitement. This was a monumental achievement, a breakthrough like never before! They had never been this connected to one another. It had all been up to them to envision what everyone else’s lives were like, and now they had documented proof. Every night at dinner, they would share stories like they used to, and even told stories they were all sure had already been heard, but it was all to hear the sound of each other’s voices. J.P.’s voice was husky and raspy, like he had inhaled the replicator machine’s fumes, but it had friendly warmth to it, like he wanted you to know you could confide in him at any time. Delilah’s voice was softer, and Henry thought it sounded like music, something he told her once, which made her blush. Every time he heard her voice through the intercom, it felt like the dinner chime had just rung and he rushed over to his device to talk to her.

Eventually, things started to change. Management had come and modified their devices again one night so they could carry them with them throughout the day and communicate with everyone on their floor individually. A note in the pneumatic tube explained that it was designed to maintain productivity. But with this new-found freedom, other things began to change. Henry was beginning to feel uneasy with this shift. Before, he knew if his friends were going to talk to him or each other because they would hurry over to their walls where their devices were. Now they would carry the devices with them wherever they went and sometimes it seemed like Delilah was talking to J.P. much more often than she used to. Henry once saw them talking when he woke up in the middle of the night and when they saw that he was awake, they seemed surprised but waved and ended their conversation.

Henry began to feel like J.P. was looking over his shoulder, maybe even watching him while he slept or while he worked. But every time he felt this way, he’d see J.P. minding his own business, typing up his daily reports or sleeping. Delilah was always friendly and continued to smile whenever they looked at each other, but Henry was always under the impression that she was secretly speaking about him behind his back with J.P. He began to increasingly distrust both of them. They were watching him, waiting for him to fall asleep every night, taking notes on what he was doing, building a case against him. They must be! Why would they do this? He asked himself this over and over again, until one night when he couldn’t sleep, and he knew: it was because they could see him! They knew everything now: where he slept, how quickly he ate, how slowly he sometimes worked, how he slacked off during the morning exercise. How was it any of their business? It wasn’t like before where they all had their own lives. Now their lives were one life.

It didn’t get any better. Henry hoped it would; maybe it could all go back to the way things were, he thought. Maybe he just wasn’t used to having his friends, or anyone for that matter, see into his life. But he knew that couldn’t be true. J.P. and Delilah continued to conspire and Henry began to feel unsafe. Eventually, making sure Delilah and J.P. couldn’t see what he was doing, he covertly sent a requisition form to Management. After a brief back-and-forth over the next few days where they made sure this was what Henry truly wanted, Management sent up the two gallons of black paint and thick paintbrush and the tools to dismantle his intercom handset. Henry got to work late one night after J.P. and Delilah had gone to sleep and covered his walls, furiously like he was trying to erase a dirty word he regretted writing. When he was finally finished, he sat down, contented, and stared at his opaque surroundings.

Delilah and J.P. immediately sent him letters through the pneumatic tube, asking him why he covered his walls. Was he being punished? Was he all right? He quickly wrote letters back saying “I’m fine.” This seemed to satisfy them because they began sending letters to him like they used to. He would read them, but never respond. They would tell him how they were meeting other people from not just the entire floor, but other departments throughout the Building and how interesting and funny they were. He would crumple the letters and quickly throw them into his incinerator tube, pretending they never came. He began to dread the thunk of a new letter from Delilah or J.P., telling him about the new people they had met or asking if he wanted to play the drawing game like they used to. The letters came less and less frequently and eventually they stopped coming at all.

Henry was content again. He knew that this was what he wanted. He wasn’t ready for the transparent walls, the openness. He needed his privacy. But he sometimes felt more restless than before, like he had forgotten to eat one of his meals or hadn’t finished one of his assignments. Late one night, he was having trouble sleeping. He thought he could hear voices from the other side of his black walls. He sat up in bed and slowly put his ear to the spot where he first put his hand against Delilah’s and strained, trying to hear, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t hear anything except his own heartbeat.",https://medium.com/revolver-reader/black-walls-ade6289396c0,['Alexander Rader Von Sternberg'],2015-11-12 19:21:11.238000+00:00,"['Short Story', 'Literature', 'Fiction']"
Not Gonna Lie,"or….Thanks, God, For the Really Sucky Years

(Welcome to My Blog, part 1 of 2)

I’m not gonna lie to you….half of what I’m going to tell you throughout this blog site is a lie. What??? Steve, you’re starting out this blog called “Honestly Thinking” by telling me you can’t really be trusted (not to mention the contradictory sentence and bad grammar)?? Yes…and no…and not exactly. I promise to always be honest with you, but that means telling you up front that a big percentage of what I say to you I don’t fully believe myself. In other words, I constantly tell lies to myself. I’m a hypocrite. What I say I believe and what I actually end up doing are often two different things. That’s because what I truly believe in my head doesn’t always transfer to what I truly believe in my heart and vice versa; thus, I continually end up living a contradictory life.

I’m sure that no one can attest to that better than my wife and kids…who constantly witness me making bold statements of faith followed by cowardly actions of selfishness and fear. But that’s part of faith isn’t it? And part of the journey. Certainly every person of faith mentioned in the Bible ultimately led a contradictory life themselves…all except one that is. And while I cannot even come close to claiming the faith that many of them had, I most definitely can identify with their failures. And so I have to be honest with you.

But first a little history behind this blog site and where the decision to start it all began. About four and a half years ago, I found myself sitting on my back porch desperately praying to God. It had been a bit of a rough year and I was looking for some answers. Not just answers about the rough year but also answers about myself. I needed to know who I was, why I was the way I was, and more about my purpose in life. And that’s when God answered me. I won’t say all that he told me at this point other than to say it blew me away and radically changed my life. Though I’d been a Christian for many years, I newly discovered a God who cared for me more than I’d ever known before and learned that some of the things I had seen as my weaknesses were actually some of my greatest strengths.

So after that I naturally did what all good Christians do after hearing a particular message from God…I created a website, founded a 501(c)3 non-profit, wrote a bestselling book, started a series of conferences, and designed a 12 week DVD study curriculum with 7 keys for how you can turn weaknesses into strengths, know the purpose for your life and become a successfully blessed Christian like me (all for just $39.95)!! No, not really. But not for lack of wanting to do something right away.

Instead God basically said to shut-up for a while. He said there was still some additional things he wanted me to learn from him first. “For how long?” I asked. “Three years,” he said. So I’m thinking at this point, “How cool! I get to be a successfully blessed Christian and just sit back and learn for a while.” I’m picturing me relaxing on the porch for hours on end, coffee in one hand, Bible spread open on my lap, sunbeams peeking through the leaves of the trees and shining on just the right verses for me to learn from, and all while angels played their harps gently above me. And, of course, people will naturally notice how successfully blessed I am as they see beams radiate from my face, a product of the constant joy in my heart and the magnitude of wisdom that has constantly soaked into my head. And while I was forbidden from speaking outwardly, my wife and kids would be a great source to practice on as they took every opportunity to sit at my feet, saying, “Teach me, teach me, teach me!!!”

Those three years ended up being the most difficult and heartbreaking years of my entire 47 years on this earth. Depression seems to like to hang around our family, though it was certainly never invited. Our children were no exception to this, while it reared its ugly head in different ways. For our eldest son it was rebellion, substance abuse and outright lies. The year prior he had started to lose his way and, due to the influence of some “bad seed” friends, found himself in trouble with the law. He confessed his crimes, went through the process of making reparations, received an unbelievable amount of forgiveness from the victims, and was able to get his charges dismissed as a juvenile through community service. We had hoped that would serve as turning point for him and that the new year would be a new beginning. But unfortunately, while he had been forgiven by so many and was very much loved, I don’t think he was ready to forgive himself. And shame has a funny way of causing people to continue in self-destruction. He slowly slipped back into rebellion to the point that after turning 18, though he was still in high school and under our care, he proudly announced how we had no authority over him and he could do whatever he wanted. His continued behaviors were not only physically harming himself but also causing all his grades to slip, endangering his future and creating more and more distrust and tension at home — all while his younger siblings watched, waiting to see what we as parents would do. After much prayer, my wife Melissa and I made probably one of the difficult decisions we’ve ever made in our lives. We “tough loved” him out of the home.

As any parent would understand, there is nothing harder than telling your child, your firstborn, the bundle of joy you had once so excitedly brought home, the one whose bumps and bruises you continually cared for, and whom you’d always promised to take care of, that they are no longer welcome in your home. We did immediately offer to let him move back in, but only under a strict contract with the most stringent of rules, but he refused. And so Melissa and I continually cried ourselves to sleep and waited for three months…until finally our son returned home. The good news is that he completely turned his life around. He went clean, graduated high school, has an associate’s degree so far in college, and in fact will be getting married to a lovely young gal in just a few months…and will obviously be moving out under much better circumstances. We got our boy back, we couldn’t be more proud of him, and our relationship has never been better. Happy ending to those difficult years right?

Well, not exactly. Because while we were busy dealing with the issue with our son, our daughter was slowly slipping into her own form of depression. Our family’s genetic predisposition, combined with hormonal changes, combined with a medication she was on, combined with the stress of seeing her brother “kicked out” of the house along with other life circumstances, caused our once fairly outgoing and self-confident little girl to no longer see herself as the valuable, beautiful, and very much loved person she was. Not long after our eldest son returned home, our daughter reached a point of such inner pain that the only way out was to consider, and even eventually attempt, ending her own life. What followed was a series of months of going between inpatient and outpatient care, multiple ER visits (including a night of me watching staff pump an overdose of drugs out of my little girl’s stomach), and ultimately a couple months stay in out of state residential care. The residential care did wonders for our daughter but as anyone who has struggled with mental illness, or has family who has struggled with it, will know the healing process still takes a long time. Thus it was over another year of continual therapy and healing before I daughter began to once again see herself as the wonderful, valued person she is.

Now I’m not gonna lie to you and tell you that those years were really such a “blessing.” Quite frankly, add in the fact that my wife battled with multiple incidents of kidney stones (including her own visit to the ER), a couple property thefts, and various other financial hits, and I’d have to say those years really sucked. And I’m not gonna lie to you and tell you all things are rosy now either. Life is hard and the following years have been no exception. And I’m not gonna lie to you and say if given the option I’d do it all over again, because I wouldn’t. And I would never wish that kind of pain again upon my children or wife. Those years sucked for them, too. But I wouldn’t take it back again, either. For in those years, I truly did learn a lot…especially about myself. I learned about the judgmentalism that existed in my heart, especially toward other parents or anyone else whose family struggled. I learned about my own arrogance and the demand for perfectionism that can be a destructive force, not only on myself but on those around me. I learned about forgiveness…of others and myself. I learned about communication and the importance of really (and I mean really, really) listening. I learned about the value of community and how important it is to have people around you who will walk with you through the most difficult of times. I learned about how lucky I am to be married to Melissa, as we grew closer during that time than ever, and I watched her grow in strength and beauty after having to go through situations that no mother would ever dream of. I learned what it truly means to be willing to “sacrifice” your own children on the “alter” of God’s will and I learned about prayer — the kind of stuff you can never get from just a sermon. And I learned a lot about “religion” verses simply real living. So in a strange way, I’m really kind of…thankful.

And so that’s what this blog was born out of. It’s an opportunity to share a bit of what I learned and a bit of what I’m still working through. And while it will be a lot about experiences from those three years it will also go to other times of learning in my life as well. Now I’m not gonna pretend to have all the answers because I certainly don’t. So I promise to be honest when I simply do not know. And I promise to truly listen whenever you might disagree. I’m also not gonna pretend to think that my suffering even compares to what many of you may have gone through because some have gone through so much worse. I am very aware that some reading this may not have had the kind of happy endings that we had. Some of you may have children who have lost their way and you are still waiting for them to find their way home. Some of you may have family who also sought to escape their own inner pain and are now permanently gone from your life. And for that I am so, so sorry. I am certain that I could learn a lot more from you than you could ever learn from me.

So some of you may be asking, “Steve, if you were only told to shut-up for three years, why are you just writing about all this now — a year and a half after that?” Because of something else I have been working on…a book. No, not one that comes with a 12 week DVD curriculum for only $39.95 and not even one that was born out of my biographical experience. Instead, it was born out of the deeper questions that I asked. For during those three years I spent a whole lot of time on my knees; but being the weird person that I am I didn’t just ask the why questions but the why behind the whys. I didn’t just ask, “Why God?” or “Why me, God?” but instead asked questions like “Why you, God?” And to my surprise he answered, and it also changed my life. And so a year and half ago I began writing this book, not with goals of becoming some kind of bestselling author, but to simply get this stuff out of my head. But I promised myself before even starting a blog that I would at least complete up through a certain number of chapters in the book (a much longer process than I had anticipated) and that has finally happened. The book is still in progress but the working title is Rethinking God: Because God is Bigger, Closer, and More Real Than You Think. You can actually read the introduction chapter to it here. The best way to describe it at this point is that it is a philosophical, scientific and theological examination (or re-examination) of the nature and character of God. I am telling you this because occasionally throughout this blog I will also be including excerpts from it or will provide adaptations of its content. One key takeaway concept from the book is that we all obey God some of the time but we obey reality, or our perception of reality, 100% of the time. It is only when we make God our reality that we obey him all the time. I say this because, as I said at the beginning of this post, I live a contradictory life. While I’ve come to truly believe that many of the concepts I present in the book are a reality, I still struggle to live it out. Thus, I’m still honestly thinking it all through myself and promise to tell you the truth about that as well.

There you have it. Welcome to my crazy blog. My goal is to post weekly but quite honestly I will quite likely not stick to a perfectly regular schedule. You can help me out by commenting on my posts, signing up for my various social media outlets and sharing with as many people as possible. In my next post I will explain even more about the birth of the concept of “honestly thinking” when I share about how I was such the “rebel” and got kicked out of Vacation Bible School at age 5.",https://medium.com/honestly-thinking/not-gonna-lie-4adfe4977f74,['Steve Baldwin'],2015-12-10 03:36:17.933000+00:00,"['Struggle', 'Depression', 'Religion']"
New York City doesn’t know what it’s doing either,"You’ve graduated, moved to New York City, and now you don’t know what you’re doing with your life or even where to get a decent cup of coffee. By Matthew Weddig

Moving to New York is scary, even before you start searching for a good bar. Photo: Harry Slater

I pretty much moved to New York City by accident, something most people do on purpose. A certain stereotyped dream behind moving to New York makes it not just part of how people plan their future, but idealise it. In contrast, New York was simply where I got a job offer, so I somehow managed to feel a little guilty about moving there.

A sprawling city where there is famously too much can pose somewhat of a problem, especially at a time in your life when you never know what you’re doing anyway. You could visit a new bar every single day and not see them all, and that’s assuming that you want to spend your life only going to bars.

I have no idea how people were adults before Yelp, the inevitable cross between social media and guidebook. Suddenly plopped down in the middle of new place, figuring out how to rebuild my personal web of restaurants and coffee shops was somehow a more daunting task than actually moving. Being a brand new adult, I’m baffled by how people were able to do that before they could take advantage of the aggregated opinions of practiced adults who had already decided on one of the dozen Chinese takeout places on their new street.

There’s undoubtedly a certain irony to finding an alternative to a big, ubiquitous chain like Starbucks by browsing through community opinions of what’s “good” (which can translate simply to “popular”), but it’s not actually that simple. The bar example is a good one; I had two friends from college visiting me in my new apartment (and, dauntingly, new life) in Brooklyn. Not having had to entertain friends in Brooklyn previously, I had little time to find cozy, quiet bars where we could talk over craft beers or proper cocktails (preferably with something of a hipster vibe). Finding a bar that meets those very specific requirements is nigh impossible just stumbling around Brooklyn and popping your head in the door, yet Yelp is a tool that somehow lets you narrow down your search to cozy, quiet, craft beers/proper cocktails (preferably with a hipster vibe).

Hipster is an actual category on Yelp. It’s an option under ambiance. Take a moment to appreciate what a weirdly useful tool this is.

Of course, not everybody finds such bars ideal, which is why I feel Yelp offers something essential beyond an average star rating. Single reviews won’t sway me, although when a negative review of a bar complained “I saw a hipster reading books” with a frowny face, I was convinced I needed to check it out. But skimming through a few dozen opinions lets you skip the busywork of finding and getting familiar with these places yourself. Within 15 minutes, I had narrowed the list down to a bar-slash-coffee shop, a speakeasy with a rotating menu of eight different cocktails, and what I can only describe as a western-steampunk-geek bar with a TARDIS restroom. There was literally a TARDIS against the wall, and inside was the toilet. (I later learned Matt Smith and Karen Gillan have been there and signed the wall.)

Now, you may have found three bars which were almost as perfect for you just wandering around by chance, but Yelp cuts through the haze in a way that you enviously wish you could for the rest of your life.

Moving to New York when you have just graduated and never seem to know what you’re doing is incredibly overwhelming. Yet through its endless list of things to do — almost all of which you will never manage — and not being certain you’re even making reasonable decisions about any of it, a big city like New York is weirdly symbolic of that period of your life. Suddenly faced with too many options, you learn real quickly that there is no magical binary of the right or wrong way to find happiness. And it is overwhelming, but it is more importantly freeing.

Unsurprisingly, it’s easier to learn this lesson about a city like New York than about what you’re doing with your life. And that’s totally fine. What it is, though, is an easy way to begin learning the freeing thought process of simply being able to decide “Yes, that is what I want to do next”. Especially when Yelp is pointing me towards a bar with a TARDIS restroom.",https://medium.com/abstract-magazine/new-york-city-doesn-t-know-what-it-s-doing-either-13c15f6363fe,['Abstract Magazine'],2015-11-30 18:04:16.380000+00:00,"['Travel', 'Life', 'New York']"
My Life as a Magnolia Bakery Cupcake Bouncer,"by Jason Diamond

There is something strange about the way people wait in lines in New York City for food: the bleary-eyed standing out the door during rush hour at Café Grumpy in Park Slope when they could easily get their caffeine fix cheaper and quicker across the street at the diner; the Shake Shack types that check the “Shack Cam” to see just how long the line to get a hot dog is; the drunken masses that will pass out in line waiting for a single slice of pizza on MacDougal.

People gladly stand outside of Dominique Ansel Bakery, which promises, “if you arrive prior to 7:00 am on a week day,” your chances of eating their signature Cronut are greatly improved. That means you have to get there around six in the morning just to have a shot at eating a monstrous donut-croissant hybrid. A more adventurous person might say you should just smash the two things together, and save yourself a lot of time, but there are actually lots of people out that just need to get a Cronut that badly.

These things seem alien to me, but in some weird, masochistic way, no matter how much of a pain in the ass the daily grind is, I could probably be convinced that any of those instances make sense; people have their quirks, and I can respect that. There might be some Proustian reaction conjured up in the mind of an East Bay transplant who stands in the lunchtime line at Dos Toros off Union Square because they make the closest thing to a decent burrito in New York; I can appreciate that particular kind of food longing. And although I tell myself it’s probably based in something rooted deep within our psyche to want sweets, I have never been able to understand how to this day, if I walk past the Magnolia on Bleecker in the West Village, there will still almost always be a line, even though the gourmet cupcake trend is dead, has been buried, and is now threatening to come back as some sad zombie.

Yet my inability to fully wrap my head around what drives people to wait for Magnolia cupcakes — which even the bakers have told me time and time again are made from the most basic recipe — isn’t because I’ve been reading about how the cupcake fetish has been on the way out since around the second Bloomberg administration. I don’t understand because, for one year, I was the Magnolia Bakery cupcake bouncer. I stood at the door and told people when they could or couldn’t come in. I’d stand there night after night looking into their eyes, trying to piece together what terrible events led them to stand outside of a bakery at 8:30 on a cold December evening or muggy summer night.

So how does one get to be a cupcake bouncer? I’d like to say that the job that rescued me from making one latte after another at the Union Square Starbucks — the one next to the McDonald’s, with fewer junkies hanging out in front — came to me because I’m friendly and outgoing with the wit of a Dorothy Parker. But my manager, a woman who dressed like she was going to the Renaissance faire literally every single day of the year, god bless her, told me the reason I was qualified to stand by the door to let people in one by one when the lines started — making sure they knew that nobody was allowed more than a dozen cupcakes at a time, and letting the people at the icing station know what was running low (vanilla-vanilla with sprinkles usually went the fastest) — was simply because of one quality I had that none of my other co-workers possessed: “You’re a big guy.”

I was and still am, in fact, a bigger person. I have a beard, and thanks to my Eastern European ancestors, a fair amount of body hair. Put me next to a door in an apron, and people might understand that I’m 220 pounds of Jewish guy standing there to make you stop. But people didn’t always stop, so sometimes I’d have to literally stand in front of the door, using my body to block them from going in. This was what I did for a living when I first moved to New York. This was how I barely paid the bills.

“Sometimes people act like children,” my boss told me the first day she designated me the cupcake bouncer. “So you have to treat them like children.” That was the motto of Magnolia when I worked there. Nobody cared about their job; I was one of the four people I knew who worked there and moved to New York to write. Two co-workers were dancers, and one was a girl from Greenwich who was too frightened to ever go into Brooklyn to drink with us. We hated the customers equally and felt nothing but white-hot rage every time one of them said, “Aren’t you getting so fat working here? I would eat everything!”

We hated the ones who waited in line, and when it was time to close, complained if they didn’t make it in — too bad for them, there was no sympathy. I don’t know what it’s like to work at Magnolia now, but back when it had a single owner whom we hardly ever saw, long before she sold it to a buyer that has been working with franchisees all over the world to open up Magnolias, if you bought a cupcake from Magnolia, there is a high probability that the person behind the counter hated your guts.

I was the first line of defense. Me. I was the gatekeeper and I was the key master. I had to stand there sometimes for up to six hours, making small talk with the Millers from Iowa who couldn’t believe there was a store that just sold condoms a block away from the bakery (RIP condom shop). I had to ignore the guy in the suit who told me the only reason I wasn’t letting people in was because I wanted to feel some sense of power in my “pathetic life.” It was actually because we had run out of cupcakes. Not really my fault. I had to apologize to Lou Reed when he stormed out of the bakery because one of my co-workers put “Sunday Morning” on the stereo when he walked in. (Lou didn’t say anything back to me.) And on that rare occasion when a person took it to the next level, and somehow acted like the worst possible person you could imagine waiting in line to get a cupcake, I was the person that got to say, “Nope.”

I was the first face you saw upon entering, and I was the last one you saw when you were leaving, unless, of course, you were the type of person that ran past me so you could triumphantly hoist your one cupcake that you waited 45 minutes for into the air like it was the Stanley Cup. That happened at least once a night.

I was the guy that lied to you and said members of Sex and the City came in there all the time since at least 50% of the bakery’s nightly business in the early aughts was thanks to a small appearance on the show, and the snowball kept rolling downhill from there. On weekends, busses filled with people on some Sex in the City tour would stop and park outside, let the tourists out to take pictures, then pass out cupcakes that we claimed were from Magnolia, but were actually from one of the bakery’s offshoots, opened by Magnolia’s former owner, and another by her former manager, both who knew about the dozen-per-customer rule. I sometimes wonder how many pictures I’m accidentally in, the guy with the beard in the apron just standing in front of the charming little bakery during a quiet moment before the lines unfurled like angry centipedes.

I wonder what happened to some of my other coworkers, the ones I liked that I can’t find on Facebook; and I wonder what will be the next New York dessert landmark filled with employees that want to be doing something different. And I wonder if somebody I know will convince me, after a couple of drinks, that we should go wait in line for whatever that new trendy dessert is. I wonder if I’ll acquiesce and feel like a sellout for doing it. But most of all, I wonder if there will be somebody waiting to let me in at the door, the next generation dessert bouncer that would rather be doing just about anything else.

Everyone has an experience that is worth sharing,"Everyone has an experience that is worth sharing — and so I share mine with the hope that it benefits someone out there.

I was in a relationship with a guy who I had intentions to marry and he was loving, kind, very practicing, I mean he quoted verses and hadiths to me regularly — and that’s what I loved most about him. I was just waiting for his family to approach mine, and in the meantime, we were getting to know each other.

In the process of getting to know each other, he treated me well. He would send me gifts, ask after me every day, sometimes more than once and we spoke over the phone regularly, and of course he would make me laugh and it felt like was just perfect. I could see myself and him together, I could see our future, and I could see us bringing up beautiful children.

However, after a little while he became quite possessive. We spoke very often, and he would get annoyed if I never got back to his missed calls or messages ‘on time’. He made it very clear that he watched me on whatsApp to see if I came online, and if I did not respond to his messages he would get angry. At the beginning, I found it quite cute — I thought that he just wanted us to be together — well, that’s how he made it sound. In reality, I didn’t realise that he was becoming increasingly controlling and obsessive.

If I ever said that I did not want to speak to him, he would threaten me. He would also change his number regularly, so if I blocked him, he would still be able to get in contact with me. I eventually had to change my number, but still did not leave me alone and would email me from ‘anonymous’ emails. He kept trying to get grip on me, to get me back in his life somehow to the extent that he approached another brother I was looking into — and emailed him information about me, most probably false.

I was beginning to feel trapped and almost hopeless. My anxiety levels rose and my panic attacks began. I felt controlled from every angle in my life. I tried to break all ties with him, but he still wouldn’t leave me alone. I felt like I couldn’t breathe and my heart felt so heavy — I didn’t think I could get away from him.

After counselling and breaking all ties with him, I feel like the person I was before I met him. However, If it wasn’t for my family who have been so supportive, I wouldn’t be where I am today without them. I can’t express how important my families support was, and I can’t begin to tell you how important the counselling sessions were. Although the counselling and family support was vital for my wellbeing, I feel that the most important factor was ensuring that I had no trace of him in my life, which was the biggest step towards my happiness. Thank God I am happy now, but it amazed me how much one person can make a huge difference to your mental state, I never imagined I would have ever experiences intense anxiety and suicidal thoughts because of one person.

I won’t lie and say that I don’t think of him sometimes, because I do — but I was told not to weigh myself down with him in my thoughts, so instead I remember to thank God for giving me the strength to remove him from my life. I hope that anyone who may be in a similar situation reads my story and understands how important it is to learn to walk away. Grab all the help you can and need — and do not push your family away, they are the people you will need the most and will help you get through it all.

God’s Geography,"You thought that the whole reason I sent you to L.A. last weekend was for that conference, didn’t you? Of course you did. But that’s not a surprise to me. Hardly anything surprises me. I knew you would think that.

But that was part of the fun of sending you there. That’s part of the fun of everything that I do. I get a small chuckle when I think about all the people who are trying to find me in churches or temples or books, when really, I’m running around with my hands in the intricate details of their intertwining threads of existence: the words they hear and the words they say, the steps they take and the steps they don’t. I laugh out loud when I think that you’ve been attending church every Sunday since before you could talk, and yet, you’re looking for me so desperately that you don’t even realize that I was the one who got you to where you are. I was there when you moved away from the sprawl of Hotlanta. I was there when you landed at LAX, wondering what the hell you’d gotten yourself into, when in reality, you probably should have wondered what the hell I’d gotten you into. But I knew what was going on. And as you clambered to adapt to the vibrancy of Southern California, my eyes were several years ahead of you.

Most people would say that L.A. is not the best place to find God. And that’s true. But it’s a pretty damn good place for me to find them. Those two years you spent running around the City of Angels, I spent waiting for you. And finally, when you’d decided that a city with perfect weather and miles of stagnant traffic wasn’t the place for you to grow, I gave you the reason to move back.

So you did. You deracinated the roots you had so carefully laid into the desert sand of Southern California and followed me back to Hotlanta, where almost all you could do was wish that Atlanta had a coast.

By that time, most of your friends had moved away. New York drew a lot of them, pulling them like magnets to the concentrated metropolis. Chicago drew more of them. And you were left to wonder if there was anyone with whom to spend your time. You had plenty of it to spend, but it seemed like the only places to spend it were discount dollar stores. So I encouraged you to wait.

You spent a year in Atlanta, watching your friends become more and more sure of what they were doing with their lives. They all converged onto their respective futures — marrying, having kids, taking out mortgages — leaving you with nothing but a sharpened sense of insecurity in your loneliness.

That’s when I sent your invitation.

You got that invitation out of the blue. It seemed like a good opportunity for you, I’m sure. That church that you attended a couple of times in L.A. invited you to return and visit for a conference. They offered to pay for your travel, so you agreed.

But it was a pointless trip. God, so pointless. You learned nothing new, felt nothing new. You’d harbored a small expectation that maybe I’d show up there, to make you feel justified or content. But that’s not why I show up, and I sure wasn’t there.

I was busy arranging other things for you.

Your flight got delayed twice on the return trip to ATL. Your plane finally landed at 11:13pm, and spit you out with a bit of jet lag and hefty dose of leg cramps. As you walked down the wide, empty terminal halls, your eyes wandered to gate C17. You looked once, then twice, and then recognized her face, just like I meant you to.

“Adelaide,” you said. Surprised and excited to see a familiar face, after a weekend of misguided spiritual pursuits.

She looked up. Your fatigued eyes and the familiarity of your face were lost deep in her memory, but the warmth in her expression glowed with a welcoming smile. She stood and gave you a hug, and you both tried to review the year and two months of time that you’d spent without seeing the other, while reconciling the simple occurrence of seeing someone who, for one reason or another, you’d never expected to see again,.

“Are you back in Atlanta now?” she asked you.

“Yeah,” you said. “I am, for better or worse.”

“Have you seen any of the old crew?”

“No.”

She smiled.

“Well, we should catch up when I’m back.”

She nodded toward her gate.

“Going to Chicago to visit my old roommate. She just got a job up there. But the flight got delayed. Isn’t that awesome?”

You smiled, nodded, and bid her farewell.

“Have a great trip,” you said.

“Thanks,” she said.

You turned away, into the vast, empty hall. She called your name, and you turned back.

“See you when I get back?”

“Yeah, ” you said. “Yeah.”

Project Proposal,"My dad’s childhood home

Allapuzha, Kerala, India

It’s 1957. My grandmother rushes through the fields with her siblings following behind her. They hide behind tall grains and bushes so as to not be seen by the workers on the fields. Their parents expected them to be indoors studying. She goes down a shortcut her brother found days before, which also enabled them to stay away from the eyes of her watchful neighbors. As the dirt became sand under their feet and the sound of the familiar chant in the distance began to increase, they knew they were getting closer. It happened only once a year. They couldn’t miss it.

On every second Saturday of August each year, the Nehru Trophy Boat Race, one of the most popular Vallam Kali (boat race) events, is conducted in the Punnamada Lake of Alappuzha District. The prize was a rolling trophy donated by the first prime minister of the independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru; it was a gift for the people who welcomed him to their town and amazed him with their 120 feet long snake boats.

My grandmother, holding both of her brothers’ hands, weaves her way through the crowd trying to get a better look at the boats. She got herself a “balcony seat” atop a coconut tree. Each boat had more than 100 oarsmen chanting the vanchipattu (boatman’s song) in order to hype up the increasing crowd and their fellow rowers. The race was almost over, but the crowd’s cheering was ever increasing. She pulls her great-grandfather’s watch out of her dress’s pocket. It’s already 4:30.

After the winner of the race is announced and while everyone starts running to the boaters by the shore, my grandmother grabs her brothers’ hands before they start to follow the crowd, and she races back home. It’s almost 5; her grandfather will be home soon. She sprints through the rubber trees, and as she comes up the hill, she can see her grandfather’s paddy fields. She races through the muddy fields deciding that she’ll just have to throw away he dress she wore because clearly it wasn’t made for the kind of adventures she went on. As she got inside her house, she threw her brothers into the shower and told them to clean up fast. Rushing to her own room, she ditched her dress in the wastebasket and cleaned up her arms and legs in the sink.

Not even five minutes after she and her brothers sat themselves in front of their school books did their grandfather arrive home. She sighed and began to read her textbook. Her grandfather was against attending the Vallam Kali since it a part of Onam, a Hindu holiday. According to her grandfather, no good Christian would even think of participating in such a thing.",https://medium.com/alappuzha-a-hidden-fortress-made-of-water/project-proposal-3142bb1a7be4,[],2015-12-10 07:31:49.597000+00:00,"['Christianity', 'Religion', 'India']"

The End Draws Near,"Our 6 month trip is nearing an end. It feels like forever ago since that fateful day Vincent sat in a meeting room and found out he couldn’t work in France. We were devastated. Our budgeting and planning did not work with zero income. But we weren’t going to give up and so in two weeks we performed some impressive feats of fiscal juggling and we made it work (if you look hard enough, there is money to be found but it might mean some sacrifices). In hindsight, it was a blessing in disguise. Our original plan was for 11 months, with me working throughout. I don’t think we could have stayed here for that long in one place. Six months has been more than enough time to experience Provence in a tiny one bedroom city center apartment. We miss our stuff and we miss having our own place. We’re going to miss Aix though — it’s a charming cosmopolitan city. We’ll miss our daily baguettes. We’ll miss the Rotonde. We’ll miss the everyday markets. We’ll miss a ton of stuff. We won’t miss the people screaming in the night as they party, though.

Having a six month sabbatical was something we wanted to take advantage of. We used Aix as our base of operations to travel across Europe. Many days were spent planning these excursions so they fit into our budget, we might as well have been working.

Overnight to the Near Shore,"A stone sleeps a long time. Under butternut shade her toes work the cobble streambed, and one of us says, A stone sleeps a long time.

War ruins everyone, from the sunshine of casualty counts to the yellow ribbons that come and go on her mailbox post.

Before I knew her house I believed in all its lonely hours.

The brook behind our homes, a Proteus sneaking to the sea. I woke this morning, heard it, and knew where I lay. I let her sleep. Making myself at home in a foreign country, I found the coffee pot.

Stones everywhere. Riverclean, their stories polished. Dozens, maybe hundreds. On window sills and side tables, mantles and corners. Cairns in a chapel.

But walls like Shakers. A house that wants no history.

At the kitchen window I watched the day moving into her front yard, and with it a car to her mailbox, then a man, perhaps from the republic of small earnest church cellars, tying a yellow ribbon bow to the post.

She came downstairs. I poured coffee. We stood at the window together. A man came by, I said. I bet he did, she said.

Yesterday she said, You think a hawk will bother a cat? I stood at the end of her driveway, scratching the cat’s chin while its back swept the dust. Depends on the hawk, I said. Maybe the cat too, she said.

Morning lay on her lawn. Her cat watched from the stoop. Putting her cup in the sink she says, You might come by for lunch. I guess I might, I said.

My house is the fourth upstream. The brook, more determined, falls over rocks in pigtails and dreadlocks. My walls and shelves fester with tales of betrayal. Perhaps there should be stones.

When I come back I see the yellow ribbon lying atop the garage bin.

We sit along the brook, eating tuna sandwiches, drinking iced tea. Her toes work the streambed.

of drugs and drinking and sex with strangers,

to the “harmless” habits of

just a few more Oreos or

one more double tap ‘til 11 likes or

perfecting a playlist to fill the stillness

of a five-minute commute –

everything we resort to

is a distraction.

We chase the headrush of emotions

from party to concert to indie-vibe drive,

windows down through downtown,

hair blowing, bass blasting —

and when we have lost the scent,

we distract ourselves with cheaply won laughter,

typing lol with barely a twitch to our lips.

We could be sleeping, but

instead we watch through eyelid slits

as Netflix rolls over to the next episode.

We could be sleeping, but

we know the slow moments before dreamlessness

are the death of our façade.

We are terrified of boredom,

for that is when our mind finally wanders

to the black hole of our existence.

If we ever dare to stop and stare,

we know we will encounter

an excruciating silence.

And in that silence, everything

making life worthwhile,

everyone we claim to love –

is swallowed up in chaos.

Food will dissolve in our mouths like cotton candy,

leaving us sticky and thirsty and craving for more.

Favorite films tired and predictable,

cherished cities commonplace,

beloved bands finally failing to move us,

leaving us numb to all the wonders we’ve clung to.

So instead we amuse ourselves

with kaleidoscopic beauty, disoriented

by candy store color until we’ve learned to ignore

the creeping blindness at the edges of our vision.

Few are brave enough to confront the black.

Even fewer have met its gaze

and found the strength to go on breathing.

As for me, I tremble in the void,

overtaken by the hush

of a paralyzing eternity.

Perhaps I’m a coward,

another weak mind

reaching for a crutch.

shooting myself in the face right now

brightening the darkness.

light and singing and an inheritance of stars,

Anatomy of a Power Call in Talko,"The ability to flow between LIVE talking and messaging in Talko calls is one of the features our customers love most. It keeps the conversation together in one place. It allows key moments to be bookmarked for later reference and followup. It makes distributed, mobile teams more productive.

Of course, many Talko calls are simple — LIVE and fast. Get done, get back to work or home to see the family. We love those types of calls as much as anyone!

But others involve both LIVE and not-LIVE conversation that may extend over time. They often include photos and/or metadata (tags and flags), which are later searchable. Design reviews, project planning calls and account status calls are examples where this is common.

This screenshot is an example of what such a call looks like in practice. It’s from our own team’s use of the app. The topic is the technical design for a feature we’re adding to our Slack integration. The call has a subject — “#slack #bidirectional”. You can see how the conversation flowed:

Hemant rang Shir. They talked for 51 seconds. They realized they needed more clarification on the feature requirements. So they added Matt to the call as a guest. The three of them spoke LIVE for 40 minutes. During those 40 minutes Shir posted a text message (masked) and there were 3 bookmarks created. Those bookmarks are synchronized to the spot where the discussion on that topic happened. If anyone needs to recall how we agreed to “populate slack pairwise”, they needn’t listen to the 40 minutes of conversation (nor review meeting minutes). They just tap the bookmark to listen at that moment. This replay ability was especially helpful for Shir in this call because he’s new to the team and is coming up to speed on our technical designs. Later the same day — after Shir, Hemant and Matt had hung up — Shir had some more specific design ideas. Hemant wasn’t available at the time. Instead of waiting for him, Shir sent a voice message, enabling Hemant to listen on his own time. While listening to the message, Hemant bookmarked what Shir said about the “internal protocol buffer”. He knew he’d want to come back to that and follow up with Shir. Finally, Shir and Hemant re-connected LIVE for ~11 minutes. During this time, they solidified a final design.

This is one example of how Talko helps busy, on-the-go teams get important stuff done in a pain-free way. Plus it’s fun:-)

Riot Alone,"It shakes me when I learn that simple words can summon thousands of people all across America out of their homes and out of their closets. One voice announcing one decision possesses them to break things and throw things and form a kind of mindless hive. They swarm and scramble. They riot, because something in the hive mind has been lit on fire.

But for me, it only exists on a screen. It’s like watching ants in an ant farm, or a YouTube video of a hornet’s nest. Newspapers make more money with each headline, with each shot of tear-gassed crowds.

It’s happening all over the country. New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Oakland. But not where I am. Not in Madison.

Madison remains somehow exempt from this voice. This supreme jury doesn’t reach Madison the same way as it reaches New York, or Los Angeles. No fires erupt, nobody swarms from their homes. Not in Madison.

My eyes glued to my computer screen, I watch years of imprisoned anger and rage spew out, preceded by hashtags. One fire starts another, and that one starts another. I watch that fire spread without logic or reason.

In any other city, people look out of their windows and see their angry brothers trying to raise their voices to be heard. The sounds form a broken chorus. But not in Madison.

I open my mouth, but no voice erupts. No sound. No voice. No chorus. So I step outside onto my porch; still, no voice erupts.

I wonder how far I might need to go for my voice to be heard. I step off my front doorstep, into my street, and scream at the top of my lungs. But no one hears, because no one is there.

A car passes by.

The night drips by slowly.

I walk to the bridge, overlooking the lake, and there’s no one there, either. No hearts have been summoned; no mind has been formed by fire. I scream over the bridge, and no one hears me.

So I walk to the highway, where even though it’s late, cars are still whizzing by. Each car carries a person trying to get somewhere else; they pass me by, as fast as they can. All the images and live-streaming videos of people across the country flash in my mind, and I step out onto the freeway.

I wave my hands.

If I were in New York, or Los Angeles, or Oakland, or Seattle, I would do this exact same thing, along with a hundred other people. We would all raise our hands and run and scream and wave and rush out onto the roaring highway.

But it’s just me. There’s no one to join me.

Not in Madison.

And maybe one of those people in the cars driving past me will whip out their phone, and take a video of me, and upload it, and someone in another small town will realize that I’m just like them.

Typewriter app ate my first 500 words,"Note to self:

When using a new program, such as Typewriter, which is so minimal it barely has a menu, use caution. The first time you open this app when a list of “Key Mappings” is presented, you might want to copy that shortcut list somewhere safe, because three days before ‘wrimo starts officially, when you decide it’s not exactly cheating to begin your 50k word count, you are so excited that you don’t want to write more scenes by hand into your notebook, and you actually got your behind out of bed partially because a coughing fit overtook you, and you had to get water, and then you were up anyway so you may as well feed the cat, feed the dog, start the water boiling for coffee, and your girls, your characters are starting to talk to you, so hey! Let’s try out that program.

So you eke out 500 words, plus or minus, most of a chapter, which may not end up being the first chapter, because another ‘wrimo suggested that you don’t have to write your chapters in the order they may be in your (hypothetical) novel, and you suffer through the typos, and the really bad writing, because this is a program, like your trusty typewriter, where your typos and mishaps are immortalized on the page, and you go to exit, and get a prompt that says:

Use caution before exiting!

And you think, surely I’ll get to save first if I exit, because you can’t remember how you’re supposed to save in this app, and you don’t think to try your good, reliable friend Command+S (Apple+S), so you say No, at first, then think, well, let’s gamble, it’s only 500 words, and I wasn’t particularly attached to them.

So you go to exit Typewriter again, and you say Yes to exiting, and Poof! Those 500 words (give or take a dozen), that you thought you weren’t attached to, you thought you didn’t care much about because they were messy and imperfect and riddled with typos in this $%^%& app, are gone.

You sit and stare at your desktop picture of the Golden Gate Bridge, taken from the top of the bridge, not finding it ironic that the perspective is 100 feet in the air, wondering where your words went. And you chuckle. You’re slightly amused because you made your character chuckle, at something that was ironic more than funny as well. But those words are gone now, along with your character’s chuckle.

You are glad you are finding this out now, on October 29th, not on November 1st, when those words matter a lot more. So you install Typewriter on another Mac, because you can’t get back that shortcut menu no matter what you do, and it’s not on the page where you downloaded the app, and you see it, again, finally. And you chuckle again, because Apple+S could have saved those measly, poignant, probably cliche riddled 500 words.

Many Rivers to Long Grasses,"Many Rivers to Long Grasses

A glance at few moments expressed in the past, matched by sounds from this era

‘When a country is defeated, there remain only mountains and rivers, and on a ruined castle in spring only grasses thrive. I sat down on my hat and wept bitterly till I almost forgot time.’

And thus finished Basho in an early chapter of his seminal Narrow Road in the Deep North, a theme revisited mystically, though with utmost clarity by Chèvrefeuille in his:

ancient warriors ghosts

mists over the foreign highlands —

waiting for the full moon

Such works need a grandiose overture to lift the words to personal meaning. Jimmy Cliff is one of the rare who can.

For the duration of this month I am following the unfolding Narrow Road, chapter by chapter, on Chèvrefeuille’s CDHK website, haiku by haiku.

Today, we see Basho Crossing the River Natori, giving Jimmy Cliff’s haunting melody more even more reference. And it is as if Basho has reached through the centuries to Cliff’s Many Rivers to Cross, for his lyrics echo Basho’s same tragic contemplation.

Indeed, ‘summer grasses’ is perhaps my all-time favourite Basho haiku, and easily the one which tugged me into this gentle art with ever deeper layers and colours. Basho’s haiku remains as potent a reminder of the futility of war, and of zealousness generally, though I do not like to read too much in a haiku, and even less to explain one, thus impeding on another reader’s own pleasure and interpretation.

To attempt to emulate the same emotions within the same theme as the two haiku above is not easy, and one can but attempt, using sincerity as a guide:

hidden by distance

yet not far from my mind

grassland whispers

In this next haiku I try to bring the warriors in:

warriors’ horses

echo in thunder

across the meadows

As I started this post with a reggae great — Jimmy Cliff and Many Rivers to Cross, I will finish it by a superb a relevant reggae anthem, Aux Armes Et Ceatera by Serge Gainsbourg /dit/: ‘Gainsbarre’ (in French slang, with various undertones to the meaning).

It is difficult to explain exactly what a scandal it was when this song came out, as I mentioned anthem, and in fact it is a reggae version of the French national anthem, politicised, covering the fallen warriors of the past, with the butterfly voices of the backup singers provided by none other than Rita Marley and friends.

How to Work 40 Hours in 16.7,"I used to work a lot — 60, 80, or even 100 hours a week. I let my work be a big part of how I defined myself. I wore those insane hours like a badge of honor…I loved telling people how “busy” I was…and how much I “had to do”.

Sound familiar?

Looking back, I realize I used my work to try and fill a void in myself. The problem was that this void was like a black hole. No matter how many hours I worked, it never seemed to fill it up. If anything, it made me feel worse.

One day I’d had enough. Truth be told, I’d had way more than enough. I stopped and reevaluated my life, trying to figure out what was important to me, and what wasn’t. I realized that while work was important, because I want to feel productive, it was just one important thing…and not the most important one at that. What’s more, I realized that working on things I didn’t really like was detrimental to my well-being.

So I decided I had to make a big change…

Searching for the Way

Since my work is important to me, I had to figure out how to work smarter, not harder. I had to optimize my work process, doing more in less time.

Of course, I also had to find work I enjoyed, that fulfilled me, rather than work that drained me. By doing this, I have more time to improve myself, be with friends and family, and truly be healthy on all levels — mind, body, and soul.

I love to read. I especially love to read things that help me improve myself. The change I embarked on gave me the perfect excuse to go on a reading binge! I read every book I could find on the subject of working smarter. I read a ton of blog posts on the same topic. I talked to people.

Then, I took the things that made the most sense to me, and implemented them. Some were complete disasters. Some worked partially, but clearly weren’t for me.

I noticed that several different solutions each had a piece of the puzzle. I took those parts that worked for me, and combined them into my own system. Slowly but surely, I developed a formula that would forever change how I work.

Enter the Pomodoro

Over the years I‘d heard about a time management system called the Pomodoro Technique. It seemed too simplistic, but as they say, the simplest things often work best.

I read the 2006 paper written by its creator, Francesco Cirilio, which explained the technique and as importantly, the psychology behind it. This revolutionary time management system is deceptively simple to learn, but life-changing when applied correctly. The Pomodoro Technique can be broken down into the following four basic principles.

1. Work with time, not against it: Many of us live as if time is our enemy. We race the clock to finish assignments and meet deadlines. The Pomodoro Technique teaches us to work with time, instead of struggling against it.

2. Eliminate burnout: Taking short, scheduled breaks while working eliminates the “running on fumes” feeling you get when you push yourself too hard. It’s impossible to overwork when you stick to the system.

3. Manage distractions: Phone calls, emails, Facebook messages, or suddenly realizing you need to change the oil in your car — distractions constantly bombard us. Usually, these distractions can wait. The Pomodoro Technique helps you log your distractions, and prioritize them for later.

4. Create a better work/life balance: Most of us are far too intimately acquainted with the guilt that comes from procrastination. If we haven’t had a productive day, we can’t seem to enjoy our free time. As a Pomodoro Master, you create an effective timetable and achieve your high-priority tasks, so you truly enjoy your time off.

“All this is great,” you may think, “but what do I actually do?”

It’s Simple:

1) Choose a task;

2) Set a timer for 25 minutes;

3) Work on your task until the timer rings, then put a checkmark on a tracker;

4) Take a five minute break (you just completed your first Pomodoro!); then

5) Repeat steps 1–4 three more times, followed by a 15 minute break.

Simple, But…

Now, you’re probably thinking “Twenty five minutes of work? That’s nothing! This is gonna be easy!” Not so fast… That’s 25 minutes of steady, focused work on ONE task. No multitasking. No emails. No phone calls. No checking Facebook. Nothing! No distractions allowed!

For me, this took some getting used to, and required some tools and hacks. Here’s what I used:

1) A kitchen timer (or an app);

2) Airplane mode (the most important function on any mobile phone!);

3) A quiet place to work and/or a good pair of headphones or earplugs;

4) Pen and paper (for those Pomodoro checkmarks);

5) Five minutes each morning to plan out the day’s tasks; and

6) 30 minutes at the end of each week to review the past week and plan for the next.

Finding the Magic Combination

Like most things in my life, I learned through experimentation, experiencing a lot of pain and frustration but ultimately growth.

At first, I thought I could do 16 Pomodoros each day, no problem. I was used to working so much, that less than seven hours of work seemed like a breeze. The first day I completed 12 Pomodoros. I got a ton done, but still felt like a failure because I fell short of my goal. I felt tired and miserable.

Over the following days, I tried cutting back on my target number. When it worked, I got a ton of stuff done and felt amazingly productive. I knew I was onto something good. Other days, I did too little or too much, felt like crap and was convinced this was the dumbest system in the world.

One day, I just ignored the system altogether and went back to multitasking. I was unfocused, unproductive, and frustrated. I gritted my teeth and kept doing things my old way for a few more days. What I found was that I got things done, but my productivity simply couldn’t compare to when it all clicked with the Pomodoros.

Sanity returned. I began experimenting with smaller numbers of Pomodoros, starting with five per day, gradually working my way up to eight. My goal was eight Pomodoros each weekday, for a total of 40 per week.

This worked (sort of) but as they say, life happens. Some days I had so many meetings to attend, or my daughter had a recital at school which I didn’t want to miss, and I just couldn’t find fit in eight Pomodoros. It became clear that 40 was my magic weekly number, but I needed to be less rigid with how I approached my work-week.

The math was straightforward: 40 Pomodoros = 1,000 minutes of work (plus 350 minutes of breaks) each week. This averages out to about 16.7 hours of work each week. That’s it!

However, when I had too much going on, or felt physically or mentally off, I couldn’t fit in eight Pomodoros. I’d fall behind, and next day I’d try to cram in 14, leaving me exhausted and not very happy with the quality of my work.

I realized I had to step back and rethink my week, paying attention to my moods. To refocus on what was right for me. The Pomodoro Technique was great, but something was missing to make it really work for me.

The Psychology of Motivation

In a perfect world, I’d have eight high-value tasks identified at the start of each workday. I’d prioritize these, and knock them off one by one, from most important to least. I’d be equally enthusiastic and motivated about each one, wouldn’t be interrupted, and would finish my day’s work in less than three hours.

Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, “we live nowhere near perfect”.

The reality is that I’m a human being, living in a world full of other humans. I have emotions I don’t control, and I often get tired. Some tasks I simply don’t feel like doing, even though I know they’re important, and possibly urgent.

To make this work long-term, I had to face these things and learn to accept them, working with, rather than against them.

My energy level and attitude affect my work and output, so I had to stay present to how I was feeling, and master myself. Reading a useful blog post, I found questions like these especially helpful:

My physical energy — how healthy am I?

My emotional energy — how happy am I?

My mental energy — how well can I focus on something?

My spiritual energy — why am I doing this? What is my purpose?

These questions helped me take into account my mood and energy when prioritizing tasks. As a result, I no longer did anything just because I felt I had to.

When my physical energy was low, I’d work on my health and wellness. When my emotional energy was low, I’d find something that made me happy, like spending time with my wife and daughter.

A Seven-Day Workweek

Remember where I started all this — working crazy hours, evenings, and weekends?

When I decided to change, I swore to myself I’d never work on weekends, holidays, vacations, or even after 5 PM. Great, right? Well, I’m happy to report I’ve broken all of these promises, and that’s actually a good thing.

On those days when I couldn’t finish eight Pomodoros by 5 PM, I’d feel stressed. I’d feel like a failure. Suddenly I realized my view of the work week was too limiting. Why did I make those commitments to myself, limiting when I could work? I did it because I was coming from an unfulfilling work life, working too many hours, and for the wrong reasons.

I transitioned from just working…to working on things that fulfilled me. What’s more, I gave myself the freedom to do non-work stuff, such as attending my daughter’s recital during what most people consider work hours. This made it easy to shift my mindset about when I could or couldn’t work.

The final piece to my puzzle was moving from a five-day work-week, where I had to stop by 5 PM, to a seven-day work-week, where I could work when it suited me. This took me from 40–45 hours available to get my 40 Pomodoros in, to having 168 hours each week. Since I only need 16.7 hours net, that means I only work 10% of my time. What a difference!

What?! I’m Supposed to Do Everything in Just 16.7 Hours a Week?!

You’re probably thinking, “I work more than that in two days and you’re trying to tell me that’s all I need to work in an entire week?”

YES! That’s exactly what I’m telling you. And NO, you’ll probably still ‘work’ more than 16.7 hours a week. I ‘work’ 35–40 hours a week, but I spend at least 20–25 of those hours on calls, meetings, networking on- and offline, and other less-focused tasks. These are important, but I don’t count them as work time.

I truly work 16.7 hours each week, and I get about five times more done in those few hours than in the other 25 hours.

There’s no avoiding it. Life happens. As long as humans are involved, and especially if you live in modern society with its 24/7 connectedness, it’s next to impossible to have a perfect working environment. However, you can work smarter without having to work harder.

Are you up for it?

Action Idea: Start with trying 1 Pomodoro today. Twenty-five minutes of concentrated work on one task. Start with one and work up from there.

Story Cancelled: “I’m NOT Where I Should Be…” (drop it),"“First Agreement: Be Impeccable with Your Word. — don Miguel”

It’s a common tale.

One that everyone has told themselves at least a half-dozen times…

It goes a little like this:

You wake up one morning, drag over to your laptop, flip it open, and you hop into your Facebook newsfeed.

You breeze past the first few photos, more news about how “so-n-so bombed so-n-so” and Trump said something else he’ll later regret if he makes it past the primaries…

Then you see it.

A story (might even be a photo) of someone you once knew, or still know… They’re obviously doing something AWESOME… yet again.

Vacationing in Bali, on the front page of Forbes magazine, living “the dream.” Then the dialogue begins…

“I’m not where I should be. I should be further along in life. What am I doing? Why am I not succeeding how I meant to be?”

It happens. It’s okay.

…And it’s how you face this conversation that means the difference between a few days of “feeling down-n-out” or feeling a greater sense of inspiration & pride for what you have accomplished.

How to Navigate the Future of News,"Our work on journalism and sustainability at the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation is rooted in the idea that there is no one model for local news. We believe that creating more sustainable local news is going to demand that we reimagine journalism as a service to communities. Doing so requires that journalists listen and respond to the strengths and challenges of their unique places when they define their coverage and develop their business models.

None of that is to say that there aren’t important lessons to be learned from the experiments and experiences of local publishers around the country. But there is a difference between trying to spread ideas and trying to replicate models. If we want to build stronger local journalism from the ground up we can’t impose models — even those that work elsewhere — from the top down.

If we want to build stronger local journalism from the ground up we can’t impose models from the top down.

Instead we are constantly on the look out for “replicable knowledge” — proven or promising ideas that can be adapted to the local context. It is not enough, however, to simply hand someone a toolkit and walk away. Adapting innovative lessons from other sectors and communities takes time and a willingness to test and revise.

Compasses not Roadmaps

In this way, we’ve tried to focus on giving local journalists a compass, not a roadmap. The compass/roadmap metaphor comes from Joi Ito, the director of the MIT Media Lab, who wrote:

“The idea is that in a world of massive complexity, speed, and diversity, the cost of mapping and planning details often exceeds the cost of just doing something–and the maps are often wrong.”

Furthermore, maps can be deceptively easy — and Ito would say forward isn’t always the direction we need to go.

When we began this work, we expected to be making maps — toolkits of best practices and models for newsroom sustainability — but we realized quickly that what we needed to be doing was giving people a compass. But, learning to use a compass takes time. Discussing a trip to Detroit Ito writes, “Before we innovated on anything, we needed to listen and build trust. We realized immediately that to do that we had to think long term and in a sustainable way, while working closely with the people on the ground.”

Another benefit of the compass/roadmap metaphor is that compasses are a reminder that we need to check our assumptions, or “ground truth” our work constantly. Writer Terry Tempest Williams describes ground truthing as, “The use of a ground survey to confirm findings of aerial image or to calibrate quantitative aerial observations; validation and verification techniques used on the ground to support maps; walking the ground to see for oneself if what has been told is true; near-surface discoveries.” For those of us working in journalism, it is not the contours of the land that we need to ground truth, but the contours of our communities whom we seek to serve.

Navigating Together

This work requires training, time, and often a cultural shift towards exploration and adventure. The reality in most newsrooms means that those things are often in short supply.

We’ve tried to address some of those challenges by giving local newsroom experimentation grants and access to ongoing coaching to help them find their way. We’ve also supported the NJ News Commons at the Center for Collaborative Media at Montclair State University to help create new networks and collaborations around training and innovation. And we’ve funded in-depth research into community information needs and user feedback for local sites. Finally, we’ve also begun looking at how we can introduce creative sparks and inspiration into the ecosystem to celebrate the good work happening at the local level and giving people a vision of where they can go from here.

We are not only funding campuses to help support local journalism, we are also learning from them. Places like the new Journalism+Design program at the New School, the Cronkite School at Arizona State University, the Social Journalism master’s degree at the CUNY School of Journalism and the Reese News Lab at UNC are pioneering innovative approaches to preparing students for a future that can’t be predicted. Heather Chaplin, the director of the New School’s Journalism+Design program, recently said, “I’m not so much interested in specific skills as dispositions. Are we helping people be able to learn really fast, so when things do change they can move with it without completely freaking out?” While these new journalism programs equips the next generation of journalists with compasses, we need to do the same for newsrooms.

Journalism on a Human Scale

Patch was in many ways a roadmap approach to local news. It charted one way forward, giving others a clear path to follow. Roadmaps allow people to duplicate their movements, and are therefore good for people who are trying to scale their work. But as Patch itself proved, local news doesn’t scale well.

Writing about the dangers of seeking scale, Laurenellen McCann, who works on developing community driven civic technology projects, wrote recently:

“I think the answer has less to do with factory distribution of The Same Thing Everywhere At The Same Time and a lot more to do with what I call ‘patterns’ … basically, learnings and practices that communities can teach and share with each other and adapt to fit their lives and context best. Scale, here, becomes a measure of proliferation that looks at depth, symbiosis, and relevance rather than a measure of proliferation based on speed and quantity.”

This model of scale emphasizes relevancy and relationships over repetition and return on investment. Instead of asking how fast you can grow and how big you can get, this version of scale asks what’s the right size to maintain the relationships that make you strong and resilient.

If our tool is a compass, then community is our due north, our guiding star.

Regardless of the unpredictable future of journalism and technology, our communities will always be there. Which isn’t to say community itself is ever a static thing. Our communities will change too, their habits, their concerns, their dreams. But, in the end our work should be for them, and as such, we can listen to them, design for them, and work with them. And if we do that right, they will help us navigate these shifting landscapes and discover new paths forward we never would have imagined.",https://medium.com/the-engaged-journalism-lab/how-to-navigate-the-future-of-news-92a99ea3298f,['Josh Stearns'],2015-09-21 19:38:07.472000+00:00,"['Education', 'Journalism', 'Community Engagement']"
Islamic Education for Millennials,"Earlier this year my wife and I decided to start a weekend Islamic class for children in Nedlands, Western Australia. We wanted to send Sumayyah to such a class, but couldn’t get her a place in one of the classes near our place and the other one was just too far. After talking to a few other parents, we realized that we weren’t the only parents looking for such a class. Many others were in the same predicament. With the help of a few parents, we started our class.

This is just a short note on the things that I think is important when raising Muslim children in the 21st century. I am not a scholar or an alim and I understand that these concerns may have been addressed by the ulama’ of our time. Just that these are things that I couldn’t really find answers for them in the traditional texts that I grew up with. Points highlighted here are especially true when children are raised in a Muslim minority country.

Islam vs. Science & West vs. Islam

The West has always had this issue of Science vs. Religion. As Muslims we tend to brush away this issue as a Western agenda against Islam. But the truth is, this is never about the hostility between Science and Islam, but against religion in general. The West has a bloody history when it comes to this battle. The Church in the European dark ages penalized, tortured and killed scientists whenever their findings went against the Christian doctrine. Islam does not have this historical luggage. In fact while the Christians were in their darkest hours, we were in our Golden Age. At that time, scientific discoveries were mostly made by Muslims.

The animosity the West has against Islam is just a reflection of their animosity towards their own religion. What they are trying to do is to tell us, “We have ‘been there, done that’ and things got better the day we decided to discard religion”. Thus, relegating religion into merely a moral compass; not as a way of life.

God and Evolution

“Where does Allah fit in the evolutionary process?”

One day, on the subject of Aqidah, I was explaining to the students about surah al-Ikhlas that Allah is the Creator and the Sustainer of the universe. Then came a question from one of the students, “Where does Allah fit in the evolutionary process?”

Evolution theory, in the scientific community is pretty much accepted without dispute, similar to the theory of gravity. The word theory in the scientific world is ‘not just a theory’. A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation.

An Islamic educator today must have some basic understanding of science. I humbly submit that basic science be part of the ilm alat, tools of knowledge, just like grammar, morphology, logic and other branches of knowledge necessary in order to fully grasp the religion.

The Ashaari and Maturidi methods of learning Aqidah was an answer to the prevailing threat of aqidah to the third century Muslims — philosophy. While I went through the Ashaari texts when I was younger, (and I am not trying to dismiss the importance of studying such texts) most students today find such extensive study into philosophy very taxing. They can’t relate to those texts.

The Ashaari and Maturidi methods of learning Aqidah was an answer to the prevailing threat of aqidah to the third century Muslims — philosophy.

Scientific atheism may be the threat to our children’s aqidah today. When the scholars of the past faced challenges from philosophy, they didn’t diss philosophy as being unIslamic, or even a deviation from Islam; instead they answered it with a framework that saved the Muslims using the same philosophy that was deluding the ummah. Al-Ghazali went to the extent of becoming an expert in philosophy to the point that he was a recognised authority in the field by Muslims as well as non-Muslims.

With the same spirit, perhaps it is time that we have a new Aqidah education framework using the scientific language. It is not to replace the traditional methods, but to build on top of them. It is time that some of Islamic scholars dive deep into science to the point of being recognised as experts in the field.

Dismissing the question of my student that evolution is just a theory that is accepted only by atheistic scientists may lead the child into a dichotomy: religion = personal morals; science = how the world operates. Such secularistic view is not Islamic as Islam goes beyond personal morals — it is a way of life.

Religion vs. Culture

Growing up in a Muslim majority country, a lot of what is culture has become intertwined with religion. While culture is a source of law in Islam, some cultures may not be suitable in other countries. When having students from different countries in the same class, coming from different schools of thought, it is imperative that the teacher knows the boundaries of where religion ends and culture begins.

Many a time my students will ask me about certain practices that is done by their parents or people back in their country of origin but not practiced by most Muslims here. Some others ask about things are that are deemed ‘haram’ back home, but practiced by most Muslims here. At such junctures it is important that teachers know what is the original ruling of such things and how culture influences fiqh.

Differences of Opinion

This is deeper than cultural differences. Different schools of thought have existed since the early days of Islam, and many of the differences are equally valid and accepted in the Deen. In the past the only time a Muslim sees a practice different from his community’s is when he performs hajj. And back then, only a small percentage of the ummah went to hajj. Most of us were used to the uniformity in Islamic practice. Differences of opinion were the domain of the ulama’.

Being too strict with one’s school of thought may cause disunity in the ummah, and being to lax with it and you may end up with no Deen to practice.

It is only in these past few decades that travel has become accessible and the past decade accelerated by the Internet that differences of opinions are discussed even among laymen. Herein lies the problem: being too strict with one’s school of thought may cause disunity in the ummah, and being to lax with it and you may end up with no Deen to practice. It is crucial that teachers now how to manoeuvre this tricky path.

For instance, I have met people who refused to pray behind another because the Imam’s prayer is invalid according to his school of thought. Yet the prayer is valid according to another mazhab. I’ve also met some others who take all that is halal in each mazhab; in the end, nothing is off-limits and you’ll have nothing left of the religion.

Striking a balance between these two extremes is a challenge. Teaching such balance is a even a greater challenge.

Different Sects

While there are some valid differences in Islam, some differences are just out of the boudaries of the Deen. And just like the mazhab, people today are exposed to the various sects that claim to be the true path of Islam. Hence it is important for Islamic educators to know the boudaries; where we can differ and where we can’t. When I was growing up, discussion about different sects are usually kept for the later stages, when one has covered the basics of the Deen.

However with the exposure that children have today, I think it is important that some introduction is done to the various sects that exist today, at least at the basic level. In my class now we are doing the history of of the sects in Islam, and the first sect that we are discussing is Shiism. And one student spoke up and said that recently she was invited to convert to Shia Islam as her friend claimed that is the real Islam as practiced by the family of the Prophet. It was a good thing we had that discussion and now she knows to avoid such invitations.

I don’t know

لا أَدْرِي : نِصْفُ الْعِلْمِ “ I don’t know is half of knowledge”

After all is said and done, it is important for teachers to know that they can’t know everything. This is not specific to educating the milleneals, but since the advent of Google, information is no longer the domain of teachers. Students may have more information than the teachers since they may spend more time in Wikpedia. But it is the teacher’s duty to impart wisdom so that the students can sift through the noise of information and obtain knowledge.

The students are at such an impressionable age that a wrong input may stick with them for life. It is important for the teacher to have the humility to say “I don’t know”. After all in our tradition, admitting that you don’t know is half of knowledge.

We may be at the most challenging time in history to raise children. Access to confusion and vice is easily obtained. But so is access to knowledge. It is the duty of educators to help the next generation make the right choices. I do not claim to have the answers to all the challenges. And as I have mentioned at the beginning, this is just a note on some of the challenges I faced as a weekend Islamic teacher.",https://medium.com/twentyeight-labs/islamic-education-for-millenials-f6df541c4a29,['Azizi Khalid'],2015-10-20 14:55:19.653000+00:00,"['Education', 'Reform', 'Islam']"
"Bippity, Boppity, Boo | The Real Stuff that Fairy Tales are Made of","When people ask me what my occupation is these days, I usually tell them I’m a stay-at-home mom…following which I get a wide range of reactions. Some say “Awww isn’t that sweet” and then go back to ranting about their lives. Some sympathize with me and tell me more about my work-from-home options. While some go ahead and tell me how lucky I am to have that choice of not stressing myself too much, others think it a noble act worthy of the highest respect and acclaim.

Well, frankly, we all have notions about each other so I have no issues with people thinking I’m available all the time and that my life’s boring. (And I could use the honor badge :)) And sure, as a kid, when I had to wake up early to go to school, I’d envy my mom for having the choice of going back to sleep when I left. (I really didn’t think she’d have much to do after I left.)

And some of the assumptions are partly true. Here are some candid confessions about my new role (as it stands today):

The going hasn’t got so tough yet and I do get time to nap every now and then (with my baby girl of course).

Yes, my life isn’t all that exciting. In fact, most of my sources of entertainment come from Facebook snooping, common gossip and glossy soap operas. I used to be an avid reader but now I turn to the less mind-consuming forms of entertainment. (Cos they’re bloody addictive!)

I have no excuse to not exercise. I mean I do have some spare time but I procrastinate it or blame it on my “situation” because it just never seems so pressing. (Until I go shopping and realize how skinny other girl shoppers are and how I cannot pull off anything even remotely sexy.)

So there you go. But I am not going to delve into details about what I actually do and preach about how difficult but rewarding motherhood is. It is what it is.

Allow me to digress now.

I mostly hang out with 12-year old girls these days, who are smitten with my baby girl, Saanvi. We go for walks everyday and I imagine it to be a good time for me to have a quiet time with Saanvi, maybe meditatively watch the glistening leaves sway and listen to the birds cooing in the distance, and also chat up with other moms (read brag and whine). The girls, however, come swarming like a cloud of bees, in effect walking all over my private plans, and hound us, screaming at the top of their lungs, “I’m going to pick her up first!”, “Me second!”, “But I saw her first!”… Owing to this persistent intervention, I’m starting to appreciate the nature of the job of a referee in a wrestling rink. In their defense, they’re better behaved now and their company is quite entertaining.

Here’s an enlightening conversation I had with two of the girls the other day. Let’s call them Jo and Dee.

Jo: So Aunty [Yes that’s what I’m known as now], there’s going to be a costume party and we’ve gotta start thinking about what we’re going to dress Saanvi as.

Dee (jumping feverishly): Oh yes! So much fun. What do you think we’ll make her, Aunty? [They go out of their way to rub it in.]

Me (mildly interested): Gee, how about a princess from a Disney movie. Cinderella, maybe?

Jo and Dee (in unison): No way!!! How lame!

Me (doing a double take after a real quick flashback to my Disney-enchanted childhood): Now why’s that lame? She’ll make a pretty princess and Cinderella is still a hot-favorite I hope?

Jo: I hate Cinderella! She’s so dumb!

Dee: Me too…Too blonde.

Me (saving that Stereotyping lecture for later): OK, maybe she wasn’t too bright. But why do you hate her so much?

Jo (launches into a speech): I mean you know the story right? She was living with her super-mean stepmom and jealous sisters who didn’t give a damn about her. She did all their stupid work for what? To get kicked around even more. How about some self-respect!

Dee: Yea, why couldn’t she just run away from home and take up a job as a maid or maybe even become a designer or something? Since she could sew and all.

Jo: Or even model part-time. She was a hottie, right?

Me (nudging them more): Wow…You’ve really given this a thought. But think about it. If she were a maid somewhere, how would she find her Prince Charming?

Dee: Pleeeease! That Prince Charming marries her because she’s pretty. And we have no way to know he’s a nice guy. Cos they don’t tell you what happened after they got married.

Jo: Yea…All he really cared about was how pretty her foot was. [Giggles]

Baby Saanvi (taking this as a cue for interrupting our profound discussion and pointing to the swing): Baa…Baa.

And thus, after establishing that Cinderella was a total nincompoop and Prince Charming had a foot fetish, this interesting exchange ended cos the girls moved on to their more-appealing pursuit.

And it got me thinking. As a little girl, as most little girls, I did want to grow up to be one of those Disney princesses with the pretty dresses and fancy shoes, a charming, dreamy man who’s head over heels in love with me, all set in an ethereal, magical world where pumpkins turn into limos and rags turn into Oscar De La Renta gowns. But does that really redeem it of the vapid foolishness portrayed in a Disney princess and the one message that is rammed into every little girl’s head — why make any efforts to control your destiny when you can don a beautiful dress and simper your way into getting Prince Charming.

Anyway, there’s still time for Baby Saanvi to fall into the lure of flowing long locks and off-shoulder dresses and fairy Godmothers so I thought, just for kicks, let’s examine two of the popular Disney Princesses and how messed up they are.

1. Princess Aurora (Sleeping Beauty):

A born Princess but blissfully unaware as her loving parents, in order to save her from an evil prophecy, thought it’d be much safer for her to be shunned in the woods with three fairies masquerading as clearly incompetent humans.(Awesome parenting that.) So she grows up to be a loner living in an imaginary world with her own version of Prince Charming singing and dancing around trees. From the story, we gather that she’s cursed to sleep her way into getting her knight in shining armor (No, I mean literally sleep).

Girlies, it pays to be lazy and absent-minded so get all your beauty sleep, dream sweet dreams of the life you could have if you were awake. And stay pretty. And of course, it takes only a song sequence to fall in love and you don’t even have to be awake to enjoy your first kiss.

2. Snow White(Snow White and the Seven Dwarves)

The original Disney Princess — guess also the culprit behind the fair-skin obsession since the dawn of time. Now here’s an exemplary princess who lives her life devoid of any brain activity and method. In fact she’s so dumb that she could easily end up as a cameo in her own movie, was it not for the bounties of luck. She glides through her whole life in blissful naivete — first she chances upon a cottage of seven little men and declares it an idyllic living arrangement for her to be cooking and cleaning their mess for them. Lucky for her, they’re asexual. Next, she graciously accepts an apple from an evidently shady, vampish character. Of course, Lady Luck couldn’t take it anymore and flees the scene to let her deal with her own shit. But then somehow, her Prince arrives, and yet again kisses her without her consent to save her. What the f*** dude? The good news is he’s into her and she doesn’t have to spend the rest of her life lounging in a glass coffin subjected to the ogling eyes of seven little men.

Message:

Ever heard your Mom and Dad saying, “Don’t trust strangers.”. Total myth, y’all. So play dumb, live on the wild side, make some obscenely ill-informed choices, and some day your Prince will come and make it all worth it.

Oh-kay. Got a little carried away there. But having said that, I’m not a feminist and I will not be paranoid about Saanvi adulating any of the Disney Princesses above or even having aspirations to marry Prince Charming. Aside from the fact that it would make me a hypocrite, I feel make-believe can be a powerful tool to inculcate positive messages in your little ones and maybe that’s what I’m going to try and do. All the signs, so far, show that she’s not into pretty princesses and more into bottles, action figures and cellphones. But maybe sooner or later, she’ll ask me to read Cinderella to her…over and over again. And I’ll be happy to oblige. After all, I like to think that most little girls are born with pixie dust and you can’t take the Disney out of them.",https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/bippity-boppity-boo-the-real-stuff-that-fairy-tales-are-made-of-dfdb1015bd35,['Shalini C'],2015-09-01 06:40:15.046000+00:00,"['Disney', 'Humor', 'Fiction']"
5 Reasons Pagination Is the Next Mobile Advertising Trend,"5 Reasons Pagination Is the Next Mobile Advertising Trend

Monetizing mobile traffic ain’t no joke. More website traffic than ever is coming from mobile devices, while ad revenues lag behind. One of the solutions to this challenge for publishers is pagination. But only if you do it right.

When it comes to ads, size matters. As a webmaster balancing ad visibility and content, you know this well. So it’s no wonder mobile advertising is so hard. There’s just so little room for ads on that tiny screen. Not to mention the difficulties in targeting on a cookie-less platform. They hurt advertisers as well as publishers.

You’re not the only one feeling the revenues drop because of the audience’s move to mobile. According to the Wall Street Journal, content consumers spend 55 percent of their time on publishers’ properties using mobile. And yet, mobile advertising accounts for less than 20 percent of ad revenues. The same is true for many of the largest publishers out there, like the New York Times and Forbes.

Mobile ad blindness might just be the biggest challenge for publishers and advertisers since the blight of banner blindness. Everyone seems to be throwing money at mobile because that’s where the traffic is. But no one seems to be making enough money from mobile ads.

Publishers aren’t monetizing their mobile traffic effectively:

Advertisers aren’t seeing direct returns on their mobile ad spend:

Although ad spend is rising exponentially, direct mobile ROI is still elusive causing many advertisers to realize that the real value in mobile advertising lies in localized advertising:

But let’s back away from the graphs, pie charts, and tables for a minute and talk about something a little less heavy on the eyelids.

Mobile monetization is hard. Even large, data driven publishers are having a difficult time monetizing their mobile traffic. And there’s no lack of creative mobile monetization solutions out there. You can create an app that is a paid mobile magazine version of your website without the ads. You can experiment with various mobile-centric ad networks. But still mobile monetization gives many AdOps the creepy crawlies. All that being said, we still recommend you take example from companies like Forbes and Google, and paginate your stuff.

Welcome to the Pagination Nation

So what is this pagination I speak of? Well, if you’re not familiar with the term, I’ll save you the Googling. Pagination is a term from the world of book publishing, that set a trend for the way we consume content. When you take a large piece of content and split it into smaller numbered bits, readers have an easier time digesting it. Even if there is no technical limitation forcing you to split the content into multiple pages. On the mobile screen, pagination has other major advantages.

Mobile connections are about as stable as a teenaged pop-star’s emotional state. And they become slow and ineffective in areas with bad signal reception (much like said teenaged pop-stars). If your content is too heavy to load fast, users will just click back and choose to browse elsewhere. This is especially true for graphic heavy content like image galleries. By dividing content into several pages, you can make sure it loads and displays faster. And if the connection dies and the user clicks back? They end up on the previous page of your site. And continue browsing to the next page when connectivity returns.

Ease of use & user experience (UX)

Responsive is just not enough. One of the most annoying experiences for me, personally, when browsing on my mobile is trying to go back to the article I was reading, and I have no idea where I was. The browser forgets my position in the long page, and I have to scroll and scroll and scroll until I find where I was. Sometimes I just give up and move on. It’s much easier for me to read long texts on my mobile in “chapters” across several pages. If the navigation is comfortable, of course.

Another thing many publishers tend to ignore on mobile is design below the fold. The more you scroll, the less friendly and comfortable the layout looks. By using single page interfaces and minimizing scrolling, you make your website mobile-friendly. Not just responsive.

Click To Tweet

More pages = more ads = more revenue

Google AdSense limit you to a maximum of two ads per page on mobile. Other networks have even stricter limitations. So you don’t need to be a math genius to figure it out. If you have 1,200 words of content you can put 2 ads on it, you can only get so many views or clicks on that tiny mobile screen. If you split those 1,200 words into 4 chunks of 300 words, you just quadrupled your inventory for a single item of content. Simple math. This is especially true with CPM models, where you get paid per view.

Many publishers do this not only on mobile, but on their desktop website too. A good example is Forbes. They tend to split 1,000 word articles into two pieces, basically doubling their number of hits and pageviews.

With galleries this is even more extreme. Instead of 10 images with some text on one page, you can now have 10 pages in a slideshow.

Decreased bounce rate & longer sessions

No math or magic here. More clicks inside your property means longer sessions and lower bounce-rate. And we all know how important those are, and why.

Better SEO & contextual ads

I am not the only one in favor of well-executed pagination. Google has been recommending it to webmasters for years. According to the Google Webmaster blog, search-friendly pagination makes indexing easier for the Googlebot. In addition, by splitting a post into parts, you can target different keywords with each page. This is not only great for SEO, but for contextual advertising as well. And contextual advertising is especially important on mobile, where there are less options for remarketing ads.

Paginating dos and don’ts

In order to be effective and beneficial, pagination needs to be set up correctly. Before you hurry and search for WordPress plugins or auto-pagination scripts for your mobile site? It’s important to understand the difference between pagination for desktop and for mobile. And learn the best practices, of course.

Paginate for fingers, not mice

Desktop pagination is simple and has been around since the dawn of the Internet. We’re using to clicking links with our mouse. But on mobile it’s tap, scroll, pinch and slide with a finger. Your pagination interface needs to take this into account. There are few things that annoy me more than tapping on the link for page 3 and ending up on page 4 because I didn’t aim just right with my fingertip.

Google Search for Desktop vs Mobile

Get creative. Use swipes for navigation through slideshows (like mobile apps or ebooks) and big buttons. Try to avoid the desktop standard of small enumerated link pagination on the bottom. Also note that Google is very strict about accidental clicks so avoid confusion between ad clicks and pagination clicks.

Don’t over-paginate

Right now you might be thinking: “Oh yes! I will split my content into itty-bitty pieces and make more money”. Well, no. If you divide content into too many small pieces (this is especially true for written content)? Both your readers and Google will hate it. From Google’s perspective, those will be considered content-thin pages. Which will hurt your SEO, ad revenues, and will put your AdSense in jeopardy. From the users’ perspective, it’ll just be too much of a hassle to have to tap or scroll to a different page every two paragraphs.

Click To Tweet

Technically fit — Or how to do mobile pagination right

Last but not least is the technical aspect of mobile pagination. Yes, I said you should get creative, but note that there are technical limitations to how creative one can be. One of the main “dangers” of pagination is scaring off the Google bot, both for organic results and for contextual ad matching. If your content isn’t organized in a way the bot can read it as a single piece over multiple pages: you’re doing it wrong. You can read more about SEO-friendly pagination in this guide.

If you use WordPress, there are quite a few plug-ins for auto-pagination, but be sure to pick one that looks good on mobile. And is Google-friendly, of course.

Don’t forget pagination changes your data

Pagination also affects the way content is displayed in analytics. You can use content grouping to see how many users viewed your content all the way through. And where they abandoned. This is very helpful information for you, as a content creator.

In addition to the way pagination changes analytics, it also gives you choices when it comes to social sharing. You can choose to let your readers share every slide or part of an article separately. Or you can let them share the first page no matter where they are in the article.

Split it when it fits

Pagination isn’t for everyone. Its effectiveness very much depends on the type and volume of content you offer, and your audience’s behavior. If your content is comfortable to view and navigate on mobile using pagination? Your ad revenues will rise. Experiment with it gently without confusing your readers too much, and see what works best for you.

Forbes, for example, splits 1,000-word articles into two pages. When they have a two-page article that attracts 9,000+ readers who go from start to finish, the ads on that article get 18,000+ impressions.

Another popular way to get more impressions from one article is by using slideshows or galleries. Posts with slideshows or galleries can easily be two or more pages, up to the length of the number of slides or photos you have. Hence, you could have a slideshow that attracts 5,000 visitors who go from start to finish that nets you 25,000 impressions if you have five or more slides / pages

If there’s one thing we would like you to leave with it’s that pagination is not right for every piece of content. To have a superior user experience that gets repeat visitors and high RPV (revenue per visitor) it’s not enough just to split your content up into a few pages. Remember books? Don’t do that. Book pages were bound by the size of the page. You aren’t. Don’t just use pagination arbitrarily, rather use it where it makes sense both to create suspense and as a natural breaking point. Have fun.

"How I Helped A Friend Sell $4,000 of Neckties In One Day Using Instagram","Imagine this scenario I was in a couple of years ago:

My friend had just come out with a line of custom neckties. He hand-made them from fabrics he imported, took off of couches, etc. Very hipster-like, and he was selling ties for $80 a piece.

How do you gain an audience of people who want to buy $80 hand-sewn neckties? (spoiler alert: he opened his online store two weeks later, and sold 50 ties the first day with zero marketing budget. It has been his full-time job ever since).

The answer? Instagram

That surprises a lot of people; Instagram doesn’t exactly seem like an ideal marketing platform. Turns out, that’s part of why it’s an excellent marketing platform.

So how does one go from no Instagram account to $4,000 of Instagram sales in two weeks?

Methodology

Instead of breaking this chapter down step-by-step as in other chapters, I’m going to do things a little bit differently.

User acquisition is, above all else, a mindset. The tactics will always vary according to the circumstances of the network or audience you’re targeting, but the thought process is always very similar. I want to take you through my thought process from the very beginning. By the end, you’ll be able to pick this process apart and reverse engineer it — doing so will work on any other network and with any other product or service.

At the highest level, user acquisition consists of two steps:

Creating something desirable enough that some subset of the human population wants it Getting in front of those people in the right way

Think about that as we figure out how to go from niche necktie company with no audience to $4,000 in sales on day one.

Preparation

I approach every user acquisition problem the same way I break down programming problems. The first step is to stop and slow down. Do not go ham creating an account or posting. Instead, grab a piece of paper and a pencil and start breaking things down into smaller pieces, until we have a solidified roadmap.

It’s important to not try to make anything perfect at this stage. Our goal is to start at the broadest point and break things down.

Do not stop your thought process. You want every thought and idea out on paper to sort out later, and your mind is the conveyor belt bringing those things to the table. If you stop the conveyor belt, you won’t have it to play with when you want it.

My thought process looked something like this:

Thought Process

OK, so we have a bunch of neckties that are a little bit crazy. They’re not really my style. Who wants to wear a necktie that’s been made out of fabric someone pulled off a couch? Johnny P. would wear this — that’s who. He’s always wearing weird crap like that. Vests with hair from weird animals, clothes some orphan hand-knit in Venezuela, that kind of crap. Johnny is kind of a weirdo. But he also dresses really well. Sometimes it’s over the top, but that kid must put a ton of time and effort into the way he looks. Probably drops a ton of cash too. Ya, he’s the perfect person for something like this. OK, so I’m Johnny. What is Johnny’s day like? Who does he hang out with, what websites does he visit? I know he’s really into international film — he’s kind of a designy hipster — big beard, cardigan, top-hats and all. And most of his friends are the same way; I guess they all like the same stuff. Johnny is really into creating things; things being “authentic” and “real,” almost anti-corporate. Craftsmanship. Artisan. Those are the words I would choose to describe Johnny. To him things aren’t just to be used; objects have a heart and soul. Everything is art. Indie music, TV shows that most people wouldn’t care to watch, that type of thing. When I think Johnny I think wood grain and thick wool. I think rustic, cabin. Very Thoreau, yet in a weird way very inner-city. New York or San Francisco. Very GQ. He’s what would happen if you mixed Into the Wild and GQ. Is Americana a word for that? I hate this word, but you could call him a hipster. I don’t know too much about hipsters. He may be offended by that. I should talk to Johnny about it. But OK, back to Johnny. What does Johnny do? What websites does he use? He’s not really a big Facebook fan — well, at least he talks about how he hates it, who knows how much he really uses it. He’s always making fun of Pinterest, too, which is interesting — you think he’d be the Pinterest type. Definitely an iPhone guy, almost to a “make fun of Android” extent. He loves design; he’s probably closest to a designer out of anything professionally. Oh yeah, I know that Johnny is on Instagram all. the. time. That’s probably because he’s into photography — most of the very artisan/designy types are, to some extent. I wonder if that was the original audience of Instagram — if their first users were really artsy people into the filters. It was kind of like Hipstamatic I guess. Did Instagram come before or after Hipstamatic? Instagram, that could be interesting. So assuming that Johnny is on Instagram, he probably has a bunch of friends that are too. After all, Johnny isn’t everyone, it’s just his type we’re looking for. How could I find them? I could just look at the people that Johnny follows. But there’s probably a lot of friends and family; I know he follows me and I’m not the target audience. But who does he follow? Who are the big hipster Instagram accounts? Not like Humans of New York hipster — that’s too “mainstream” — ha, it’s kind of ironic that something is too mainstream for this hipster company. At this point I pull out my phone and start to play. Alright, let’s find Johnny’s account. Who does he follow? Huh, it looks like he only follows friends and family. Or at least, these seem to be friends and family, I’m not sure if they all are not; he has a lot of friends that look and act just like him. These could be celebrities in his world for all I know. I’ll find if there are any big accounts later. What words does he use, what kind of photos does he post? How can I find all these people? Here’s a picture of a lake. Hashtags #lake. Very understated. Not much going there. Here’s one with him in it. Oh wow, he’s cobbling his own shoes. Uses the #artisan hashtag. Let’s check that out. Eh, this looks mediocre at best. The first few photos are someone making chainmail, remodeling their house, etc. Not as targeted as I would have thought. Back to Johnny. Family photo. Next. Oh very interesting. He’s got on a suit from goodwill — that fits him really well. Hashtag #dapper. #Dapper — that’s very interesting. That’s very GQ. Not as artisan-y, but let’s check it out. Wow. These guys are all obsessed with clothes. Weird clothes. This dude made a coat out of hair extensions. WTF. That might be too crazy for Johnny. And 13,000 likes? Let’s check this dude out. Alright, maybe he is the right type. He and Johnny would hang out and talk about clothes. This is the person we want. He’s using the keyword #dapper. And there are millions of Johnnys using that keyword. Here they are — the people we want to reach.

I apologize if that was a little bit annoying, but that really is where most of the important stuff happens in marketing. If you take that apart and look at where the stream of conscious started, you’ll find a few things.

Always start with the target market.

The biggest mistake I see people make is they start with figuring out how they can get reach. That is very dangerous. Always start by figuring out the type of person you want to target, and where a bunch of them congregate. From that point we can figure out how to target them or get our message in front of them; first we have to know who they are and what they like. Sending out an email to 15 million random people would probably be less effective than engaging in a real conversation with a dozen of these folks. We just avoided a lot of wasted time.

Get in the mind of the people you want to reach.

Later on we’ll do A/B testing and figure out where we were wrong, but your assumptions and playing around can get you a long way. The most enlightening thing to do is talk with someone who falls in your target market (ideally you are that person), but for now we’ll just stereotype and try not to be too evil in doing so.

Find where the people you want to reach congregate

You want as large of a grouping of your target market as you can get. You also want that target market to be as specific as you can. You can’t always do that in traditional ways like finding accounts they follow or finding a big intentional group of them. One of my favorite ways is finding a keyword or hashtag that unintentionally ends up belonging to a specific group.

You already know how to reach them

The interesting thing about following this process is that in doing to you accidentally figured out what your marketing should look like. In this example the words that stick out are “artisan” “dapper” and “craftsmanship.” Now we go into creation mode with a great understanding of how to build up a world that they want to be a part of.

Creation Mode

Our end goal will be to get in front of the market we’ve found, but more importantly than that we have to have a home for them to land.

Looking back at the discovery process, you found the look/feel we were going for — words like “artisan,” “dapper,” and “craftsmanship.” Once we had that for guidance, actually creating the content was natural.

Not surprisingly, these photos were some of those that performed the best:

You can see they all went for that handcrafted feel.

Linking

Instagram is a little tricky, because no links are allowed in the posts themselves. That is probably a good thing — it forces you to keep your posts non-spammy. If you really want to send people to a specific link, it’s common practice to add the comment “link in bio” to a photo, and change the link in your Instagram profile. Don’t let lack of linking turn you off from using Instagram; it works just fine without it.

Contact Mode

Contact mode is where the fun stuff starts. We have a million people who we think may want what we’re offering, we have the perfect profile set up to drive traffic to our store/product/whatever, now we just have to get in touch with them. Our hopes are that if they see a mention of our profile they’ll visit, hopefully follow us, and maybe check out what we’re selling. If everything is done right, we should be able to watch traffic flow from our profile to our website, and sales converting as a result.

Since mobile purchasing is hard, in the beginning we set up a landing page where they could drop an email address for 20% off.

Going back to Johnny, there are four main ways I could contact him using Instagram:

Tag him in a photo Comment on his photo Like his photos Follow him

Tagging in a photo

This is spammy and annoying. Don’t tag me in photos if you don’t know me.

Commenting on photos

This is often spammy and annoying, but could possibly be pulled off well. It would just take a lot of time and effort. If you are commenting on others’ photos, be very careful. Commenting “Hey, check out my products at @username” is among the worst ways one could initiate a conversation with anyone.

Liking photos

Liking photos is easy, and no one hates it when others like their photos, though it’s possible the likes will be buried amongst dozens of other likes. But I know that I’ll see someone who liked my photos and go check theirs out all the time, so this isn’t a bad strategy.

Following

The most obvious and easiest way would be following. You show up independently to them for a few minutes, and they’ll most likely check you out. Having more followers is a good thing as well.

If you’re following, though, make sure it’s very targeted and don’t just go crazy. A good way to tell if you’re targeting the right people is seeing if you actually enjoy your feed. If following ruins the Instagram experience for you, you’re probably doing something wrong.

One of the biggest mistakes is to use the number of followers as the most important metric. There are plenty of accounts that will follow back just because. You’re not looking for those — you’re looking to generate interest and create a community around your photos, not get a bunch of ego boosts that don’t help you at all.

Now let’s get down to brass tacks.

Follow, Like, Like, Like

After about a day of experimentation and testing, we found the method that works the best. We called it “follow like like like.” The process is simple — go to the most recent section for the hashtag we chose to target and choose the top picture. Follow that account, go to their photos, and like their most recent three.

This shows the user that not only did someone who is kind of like them follow them, but they also dug a little bit and really liked what they found.

Here’s the crazy part: When we did this, the follow-back percentage approached 25%. Meaning for every four people we followed, one would follow us back. And, more importantly, we could see a decent amount of traffic going through to the pre-launch landing page we had set up.

We did this for a week before setting the product live, and by the end of the week we had 10,000 followers. In one week. Each photo was getting over 100 likes, and other people were being tagged in each of the photos by their friends. The content was great, and people really cared about what the company was doing. And, perhaps best of all, it was all done legitimately, without (I hope) annoying too many people, and completely manually. It did get tiring spending literally all day liking photos on Instagram, but it was all worth it come launch day.

Launch day came, and, as stated before, the company sold over $4,000 of inventory. This had been a side-project before that, and now the creator could quit his job and go full-time doing what he loved. He hasn’t gone back since. As a marketer, there’s nothing more rewarding than letting the makers support themselves by doing what they do best.

It’s always a good rule of thumb to do everything in marketing manually first. Once you see that your method is working, it’s time to automate and scale. There will be more on scaling out later on in the book, but for automating there are some really simple bots you can use to save yourself the time and effort of mashing your fingers on Instagram screens all day.

FollowLiker

For automating the Instagram process, I recommend a bot called FollowLiker. FollowLiker is a bot that does the liking and following for you automatically. You’ll need a PC or a virtual machine to run these bots, unfortunately, but at a price of a few dollars per month it’s probably worth your sanity.

Make sure that you know your process is working manually before automating it. Bots do not solve problems for marketers; they just make the processes that work more repeatable.

Note: Bot at your own risk. If you do anything that seems unnatural or automated, you risk getting banned. Bots that don’t use the API are against the Instagram terms of service, as is doing anything spammy.

Instagram is getting stricter with its rate limiting (how many you’ll be able to like and follow per day), so you have to be careful with the settings the bot is running.

I use the following settings per account:

2100 likes per day (17–22 second delay)

450–600 follows per day (15–20 second delay)

350–450 unfollow per day (15–20 second delay)

Minimum of 1–2 photos posted manually per day while running these settings,

The average account will increase at around 250 followers per day at these levels, while the better ones will approach 500 per day.

Unfortunately the bot doesn’t allow the “follow-like-like-like” strategy, so it will be per photo/account, but even the worst accounts should grow by about 7,500 followers per month. That doesn’t seem like a lot, but when you have 90,000 people seeing your photos after a year, you’ll see the sales/traffic really start rolling in.",https://medium.com/user-acquisition-for-hackers/how-i-helped-a-friend-sell-4-000-of-neckties-in-one-day-using-instagram-90a814df79dc,['Austen Allred'],2015-10-27 18:42:05.400000+00:00,"['Social Media', 'Instagram', 'Growth Hacking']"

A look into teaching English in Thailand,"Teaching a language abroad for two months was all it took for Rob Norris to decide that education is the right career path for him.

Watching your students improve while gaining confidence is a heartwarming, life-changing experience. Photo: Rob Norris

With the graduate job market being the tough beast it is to break into, many university graduates are looking to teach English as a foreign language overseas. Making money, travelling and gaining experience for that possible future PGCE is the ideal alternative to working long and unrewarding hours in an office job while living back home with the parents.

From mid-July to the start of September, I spent eight weeks teaching at a state elementary school in Thailand through the British Council. After arriving in Bangkok, I was shipped out to a farming village in the North-East of the country. For the following two months, I was to live with the headteacher of the school and his family. The headteacher was incredibly welcoming and desperate to have me help him improve his English. He happened to be a huge Liverpool Football Club fan, and was delighted when I gave him a coffee mug with the Liverpool badge on it as a gift from home.

The language barrier between myself and the community I was living in made the first few weeks difficult. It also took a while to get over the culture shock of seeing whole families riding together on a motorbike with no helmets on and the large number of stray dogs roaming the school grounds every day.

Overcoming culture shock and getting your head around teaching a class your native language when you cannot understand their own definitely takes time, but with the right mindset it can be done. I personally found that the best way to do this was to throw myself face first into the lives of the people in the village. On most evenings the children and adults would gather at the small concrete yard just outside of the school to play volleyball. When I walked past during my first weekend, I was pulled by some of my students into the game and before I knew it I was battling hard with the rest of the team to win the match. Volleyball soon became a regular past time during my stay and allowed me to connect with the students and their families outside of the classroom.

The actual teaching involved playing games with the children and making various worksheets for them to do together. Wordsearches went down well, with some classes demanding to do one every week. The Thai teacher of English at the school was a great help in roughly letting me know the ability of each group and we would often plan the lessons together.

Many of the children were gifted in English; some were even able to hold their own conversations about football or music, usually Korean pop groups. It was easy to get carried away showering these children with praise and forgetting about the kids who were struggling with grasping the language. This is where being a part of the local community helped. By spending weekends attending local ceremonies at the school or Buddhist temple, I was able to interact with them outside of school which increased their confidence in trying to communicate with me. Once the children realised they knew more English than I did Thai, they started trying to teach me their own language too.

I knew from the start that the children I taught in Thailand were not going to turn fluent in just two months, but seeing their confidence improve as they started stringing words together in English, and the fun they had doing it, was amazing to watch.

The T and me,"It turns out that I, a cis, have a lot in common with transgender women and men.

It started when I discovered how I completely relate to transgenders’ quandaries about clothes.

I resent having to pick a gender every time I go out in public. I resent how conformity pushes at me. I want to feel good about myself in any clothes I wear.

Duh, we’re all alike under our clothes and other skins.

Still, it wasn’t obvious until I read about their experiences, fears, confusion and anger on Gender 2.0. In doing so, transgender writers raise their vulnerability yet another notch, and I admire that.

I’m mesmerized by my mirrored self in their stories; I find myself nodding and saying “YES!” again and again. In those few paragraphs their humanity and its pain become visceral, and resonate down to my bones, an earthquake and all its aftershocks.

Like Cherno Biko. Outwardly I couldn’t be more different than her, but Cherno’s description of the struggle to “celebrate my body” is absolutely universal.

…for the majority of my life I internalized the shame of being too fat, too black and too intersex for mainstream America. Everyday in ways big and small I was told that my body didn’t belong in their bathrooms, on their airplanes and especially not on their runways. However since relocating to NYC earlier this summer I’ve become one of the first plus size trans models of color.

I believe that when we show up whole and authentically we allow others to do the same.

YES. To show up whole and authentically: the best any human can do.

Similarly, what Cherno writes about her locs (aka dreadlocks) is entangled with me and my naturally outrageous hair. The feeling of memories embedded in hair, the sadness of a haircut — me too, me too.

Transgender women who retain the body hair of their male physicality have an especially tough time. Still, any cis woman could relate to fear about wearing “risky” clothing as described by Alok Vaid Menon:

Here’s the thing: being fabulous doesn’t protect you. Compliments don’t keep you safe. The thing about being a transfeminine person is that everyone always remarks on how “fierce” or “fabulous” you are, but few people ask how you are getting home. Every day I look at my closet I have to ask myself how I’m getting home. Every day I look at my closet I have to ask myself how I’m feeling that day. Am I ready to endure constant street harrassment? Am I ready to be gawked at? Am I ready to have people take photos of me without their consent? Am I coming home late?

YES. That is a dilemma I understand. My peak bimbo years were a roller coaster: feeling great about being sexy, then abruptly feeling terrified about the attention that would bring.

The core here is how you hide or wear your identity. Eve’s story, living a suburban life by day and being her true self online at night, is one that millions of people share.

Meredith Talusen writes about Eve with great compassion and sympathy, and — accompanied by the perfect illustrations of Miguel Libarnes — teases out the subtle agony of someone living this divided life.

“I feel good dressing. I don’t feel good looking at myself dressed,” Eve told me.

YES. I am whole when I take the actions that align with my true self … I am fragmented by how that echoes back when I look in the mirror.

More than anything, I relate to transgender people because they don’t fit into a box and they rebel against being put there.

The history of the trans movement shares so much with other human rights movements: First the explosion of anger, then the colorful celebrations of self-love, then the long slog of the million battles to get the law, the money and the White House on your side.

I recognize all the points along that line: Heads are turned in your direction, heads don’t spit or sneer or laugh, heads don’t look away, heads nod in acknowledgement. And now, as Alok says,

“We’re in this really weird moment where so many people mistake visibility as something that means we’re done. I’m like, ‘No, we’ve just begun.’ ”

Identity is not a given. The transgender writers of Gender 2.0 are pretty defiant about that, and their defiance makes me stronger too.

I cheer them on from the comments section and read them obsessively because this is me too: I am all my labels and none of them, and why don’t you just listen to what I ACTUALLY say instead of what you want to hear or think you know?

Perhaps the best example: Tyler Ford. Tyler prefers the pronoun “they” and “them.” After several years as a transgender man, Tyler has taken on agender as a more accurate self-description.

They succinctly tell us what it is to stride and dance and limp along those lines which divide us into male and female, black and white.

At 24, Tyler shows a calm patience about this process:

I wasn’t black or white, but both; I wasn’t a man or a woman, but neither. The two years I spent living as a man, and the following two years spent navigating my identity as an agender person inspired me to question everything I had been trained to see and embrace about myself — and everything I’d been taught to look away from. … I now know that there is room for me to hold and explore all of my identities — though I am still figuring out what it means to be black, what it means to be agender, what it means to be me.

And that self-knowledge is evident in the decision to wear a crop-top to a concert:

Nothing I wear is ever read as neutral; I, myself, am rarely read as neutral even to the people (friends included) I repeatedly come out to. As a result, I change into a tight crop top. Even though it’s not what I’m in the mood to wear, I prefer the ways in which people take one second longer to think before they speak about me when I wear one — even if it means tripping over pronouns and gendered language.

I had my own kinds of subversive defiance at that age, but I would love to have had their level of self-possession to go with it.

Tyler, Cherno, Alok, your everydayness gives me courage. When you all put your true selves out there nonstop, what the hell do I ever have to worry about?

"Interview With a Person Who Paid Off $48,000 in Student Loans in Four Years","by Jacqui Shine

Marnie Gallowy! The Internets told me that last week — eight years after you graduated from our ol’ alma mater — that you paid off the last of your $48,000 in student loan debt. IS THAT TRUE? Are you a wizard?

Hey JShine — you found me out, I’m a wizard! My student loan debt totaled $48,000 and change ($33-ish from undergrad, and $15K from a poorly advised year in grad school). The bulk of my undergrad debt was federal student loans, but bundled in there was a nasty $8K Sallie Mae with a 12 percent interest rate. My grad school debt was also a mix of federal and private, but the private loans I got at that time were comparatively reasonable.

You paid it off in eight years! How did you do this!?

Really we weren’t in a position to start paying off anything but the minimum on our debt until after we got married in 2010, so jeez, all of this was paid off actually in about four years?

For my first year out of college, my mom helped pay for my student loans. She had just landed the first well-paying job of her career, so she wanted to help out, and I was grateful for the time to figure out what I was doing with my life. After that year when she was paying the minimum contribution and I picked the payment back up, my partner Tom (now husband) and I looked at the balance compared to what it was when I graduated and were shocked that it was higher than before. The minimum wasn’t even paying off the interest.

In 2007 we moved to Chicago because Tom got into a great Ph.D. program, and I got another secretary job. We were living exclusively off my $25K/year income, pinching pennies and eating a lot of rice and beans. After a year of that, I decided that my way out of secretary life was to start an MFA program to be an artist, so there was a year when neither of us were making money other than my part-time job in the department and Tom’s funding.

Okay, so four years ago you and Tom decided to go after your student loan debt. What did that look like?

After we both had more predictable income, we made a plan to prioritize paying off debt. That year when we weren’t even paying the interest made me vengeful, and Tom has always felt insulted by debt — he’d rant to anyone listening that it’s a tax on our future. We decided that we were able to live just fine at $25k/year, so that was what we lived on even though we were making more. Everything extra we made went straight into savings, and then every few months we’d throw a big chunk of that savings into the debt hole. (First to go: adios, Sallie!) We fought really hard against lifestyle inflation: kept cutting our own hair, buying things second hand, taking an eight-hour Megabus trip instead of flying, etc., even though we could afford not to. We don’t have a car, but even public transit started feeling like too much: I realized I could save $100/month on train fare by biking to work instead of taking the el.

In the last two years we both lucked out and got pretty solid jobs: I got a full-time job in design, and he was King of the Adjuncts (teaching eight classes at a time) before he got a totally sweet research job last September. That really helped: we were still living off our mega-condensed budget, and suddenly had a lot more money to throw at debt. Last fall we were taking a train back from a wedding in St. Louis and realized kind of unexpectedly that we had enough money gathered among all our savings-buckets for a down payment for a house…or enough to obliterate my debt, which was about $18K at the time. It was scary to think about moving all that money, so we waited a little longer. This month, we upturned those buckets and finished the debt off once and for all.

Holy crap.

I do want to say, the last thing I want is for this to sound like a bootstraps story: “We were able to pay off a boat load of debt, so anyone could!” Nope. We had a hell of a lot of luck and privilege. Neither of us got sick or have chronic illnesses; neither of us had huge family crises that required us to stop working. We’ve been together for years, so we’ve been able to share expenses and lean on each other when jobs disappear. We live in Chicago, which has super affordable neighborhoods and jobs that pay enough so that people can live in the nicer neighborhoods, you know? We both have pretty elite educations, so the jobs we were able to get when we finally found footing in the job market have been pretty well paid. Frankly, having the choice to live under our means is a luxury, and one that we realized might not always be around.

Did you have health insurance during this time, either/both of you?

Tom was without insurance for the year that he was without funding, but the rest of the time we both had some kind of coverage. I paid for an emergency-only policy out of pocket during the years when I was working multiple part-time jobs. I got my policy through Fractured Atlas, which is kind of a union for artists, so the insurance I got was pretty affordable — like $75/month? I never went to the doctor, though, which is partially habit from having grown up without health insurance. I got the coverage in case I got hit by a bus or doored when biking around town; it was more for peace of mind than actually getting health care. When I got my full-time design job it came with full benefits and because we were married I was able to get Tom on my policy, so we’ve both had pretty nice insurance for the last year and a half or so. It was so great to be able to get new glasses!

It sounds like you gave up a lot or delayed or deprived yourselves a fair amount. Is that true?

Good and tricky question! We try very openly and conscientiously to orient ourselves towards life/money in a positive way rather than negative. [Sometimes it was] really rough. There were periods when we were both really demoralized and depressed from working so many late hours and early mornings without feeling like we were getting anything out of it. [But] we made lifestyle choices to build towards what we want — to pay off debt and have the ability to be generous — rather than what we were willing to give up. I mean, would I love to spend a few weeks in Mexico? Totally. But looking at the past few years, I’m really happy and don’t feel deprived. Materially we did go without a lot of conveniences, but again it doesn’t feel like a loss, just a choice.

About that $33K logic/philosophy degree. If you could actually go back in time and tell Youthful Marnie what to do, would you advise her to make a different choice about college? If you talked to Youthful Marnie about student loans and how SRS BIZNESS they are, would YM have even understood/gotten/bought it?

Ugh, good question. I think about this a lot. I am really, really happy with where I am in my life and that is of course a result of having made the choices I did, so I don’t think I’d advise my younger self to do anything differently. The logic/philosophy degree gave me a lot of confidence as a writer and as a debater, which is a broadly applicable skill set. I might not have a job that directly relates to that training, but I’ve gotten every arts grant and fellowship I’ve ever applied for and I don’t think that’s because I’m particularly talented — I just know how to craft a really strong argument for myself. One of those grants helped to boost my visibility in the arts field I am working in, which has opened a lot of doors for me. And the graduate program I went to for a year, which was very expensive and very disappointing, helped me realize that that I don’t need an institution’s permission to make the work that I want to make. That was extraordinarily liberating. I also met great friends and colleagues who inspire me to make better work, to keep challenging myself, which remains hugely valuable.

I do wish that someone — time-traveling adult Marnie, or better yet a financial counselor — had been available to help me really learn about money when I was younger, maybe even younger than college. We both grew up in homes with instability, barely making it paycheck-to-paycheck, and, boy, do I respect what a challenge that must have been for our parents. But that means that neither of us [had] an intuitive grasp on how to think about big-picture finances other than “be frugal and try not to panic.” We’ve tried to teach ourselves, but I see the fluency in which some friends think about money and it’s baffling. I don’t think that my teenaged self would really understand what a burden $48K in debt would be; it seems like such an impossible number. All I knew was that I wanted to go to college, and I’d sign whatever paper they gave me that would let me keep studying.

I think that’s the case for a lot of students. How did you finally start to acquire those financial management skills?

When I graduated from college in 2006, I had absolutely no understanding of how to deal with money. I had been mostly financially independent for the past four years, but with the mentality of, “If I don’t look at my balance and don’t spend money, I should be OK! La la la!!!” When I got my first job as an entry-level secretary at a university HR department I was given a form to fill out for my 401(k) and I had no idea what that was. That made me feel like an idiot, which I resented. I spent the next few months apprenticing myself to every personal finance blog I could find and obsessing over my Mint.com charts and graphs, which became a mindless hobby. Check email, check Facebook, check Mint. Lather, rinse, repeat.

So our alma mater’s vaunted financial literacy program didn’t make a dent while you were in school, huh?

Ha! No, it sure didn’t. But now that you mention it, I do remember getting a lot of flyers in my mailbox and email blasts about those events. Maybe instead of Time-Traveling Future Self or Personal Financial Advisor I should have wished for someone to shake me by the shoulders and tell me that I should take advantage of free programs instead of feeling too intimidated/embarrassed to ask for help?

And how did the finance stuff work in your relationship? What was your household budgeting like in your years of deprivation & penny-pinching? How did you and Tom do that?

In those years of super tight finances, strategizing about money started feeling like a sport: We were battling a behemoth, and had to strategize our best move. It totally became a game. “If we do X a little cheaper, we could pay off that much more!”

Tom and I are both big advocates of putting money right in to savings; our strategies are a little different, but in ways that are complementary. Every paycheck he would put 10% into emergency savings, 10% into retirement, 10% for charity, 10% into a savings fund for family (in case of emergencies), stuff like that. My savings were more directed towards specific predicted expenses, like “Thanksgiving travel” or “book printing” or “my computer is crap and will die any minute.” (That was actually the name of my savings account; the stupid computer was crap and did eventually die, and I had enough money to go buy a new computer. The system worked!) I think at one point I had 16 different savings accounts? A few times a year we touch base and spend an hour or two looking at Mint together (which has all of our accounts linked up) to be sure we are on the same page about things, and make adjustments then.

Auto-debit is absolutely my best friend. On the days my paycheck is set to deposit I have money scheduled to be transferred into my various goals: $15 here, $20 there, for every dollar beyond what my monthly expenses require. They are all slow to accumulate because I don’t have a lot to put in, and that little bit is divided in a lot of directions, but it [has] helped me feel like I was building towards something. That strategy definitely helped me stay on budget: if I needed something beyond what we had allocated, I had to go out of my way to transfer money out of my savings. That was usually enough friction to keep me from impulse-buying a new dress or something.

Now that you’ve gotten rid of this burden, how will your financial lives change (or not change)?

You say burden metaphorically, but it has been two weeks since I closed out my student loan account and it honestly feels like a physical weight has been lifted. Before it felt like we were walking on leaves and branches draped over a pit trap, and any misstep would mean falling into disaster. Now we’re on even ground. That difference, that stability, feels momentous. I don’t think we’ll change our spending or savings habits. They’re pretty well ingrained now, but we’ll be able to keep the savings we slowly accumulate instead of throwing it into the pit. GOOD RIDDANCE, PIT!

I think the biggest change is how I feel about risk. I have been as financially risk-avoidant as anyone in a creative career can be, which has worked out well in this arena but has put a bit of a damper on building momentum in my creative life. I’ve prioritized work with a predictable income over time to work on my art practice, which has meant a herky-jerky output. I think I’m going to switch that order around; it feels like a safe time to take a big risk. Now if I stumble, I’m still on solid ground, you know? (PIT METAPHOR!) I think 2014 is going to be a good year.

By Elaine Monaghan

It was dark one night when Boris Yeltsin was still president of Russia, a few tumultuous years after communist rule ended.

I wrapped up the closing shift at the Reuters office and drove across the Moscow River in my red, box-shaped Lada Niva.

It was 1995 or 1996, when I lived in the apartment with the tulips I planted on a balcony behind the foreign ministry, a Stalinist, 1950s skyscraper that beckons you across Borodinsky bridge from the area of the Radisson Slavyanskaya hotel, which housed the Reuters office.

It can’t have been winter because I don’t remember worrying about whether the car engine would start.

I approached a corner in the little maze of streets near the foreign ministry, a few short turns now from home. Out of the shadows to the right appeared two grinning representatives of the GAI — pronounced “Ga-EE” to spell out the Russian acronym for State Automobile Inspectorate.

They waved me down. I stopped, nervous. I was alone in the car, it was late and the street was deserted. Would I be arrested? Would they demand a bribe? Did I have any cash? Cigarettes, at least? Were they real traffic police?

Let’s Start the New Year With Some Small Wins,"This year I will not pretend that I don’t have to make student loan payments. I will budget, and I will read @TheBillfold. — Sean A. Higgins (@luckycloud) January 5, 2014

Perhaps you made a money-related resolution this year, or if you don’t believe in making resolutions, perhaps you’re simply thinking about money and how you want it to work for you in 2014.

Save more money, pay off debt — it’s stuff we all want to do regardless of the time of year, but it can be daunting if the goal is to pay off tens of thousand dollars worth of student loans or credit card debt. As we’ve seen from our monthly check-in (we haven’t forgotten — we’re doing one at the end of the day!), it’s a gradual process, and that’s okay, because the point is that you’re making a concerted effort to pay down debt or save up money, and you’re doing it regularly.

In any case, one thing I like to do at the beginning of every year is set a small money-related goal to hit by February that’s small and attainable. This allows me to start the year off on a good note. So what’s one small money-related thing you’d like to accomplish by Feb. 1? Mine will be to set aside enough money to double the payment I usually make on the one private student loan I have.

Average day for a high schooler

When someone thinks of high school what are the first few things that pop into someone’s head?

Everyday High School vs. Hogwarts

drama between friend groups cramming for tests and exams while still trying to have a social life who is dating who

This would be an average day of a teenager in high school. Even though, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry may seem similar to an average high school there are important things that make these two very different. One may think they are in the Harry Potter Discourse after watching one movie or reading one book, but it goes much deeper than just that.

Average day of high schooler at Hogwarts

The average day of a wizard at Hogwarts consists of

fighting evil trying to stay alive teaching oneself to be able to fight Voldemort

These differences help the people in the Harry Potter Discourse to know who is actually in it or not because people who are not apart of this Discourse would think an average day in high school is exactly the same as a day in Hogwarts. James Paul Gee explains throughout his writing journal “Literacy, Discourse, And Linguistics:Introduction” whether or not one is in a Discourse or not and how will they know.

Being apart of Harry Potter Fandom you must use the correct language, have the same beliefs, practices and know what is going on inside the Harry Potter world.

Harry Potter Fan

Everyone has their own Discourse and there own opinion on what others need to know to be apart of that Discourse. In this case the Discourse I will be talking about is a Harry Potter fan. This Discourse has its own language, beliefs, practices, etc. Harry Potter Fandom falls under the category of Secondary, non- dominant Discourse. James Paul Gee who has his own views on what a Discourse is and how you enter one states

“Non dominant Discourses are secondary Discourses the mastery of which often brings solidarity with a particular social network, but not wider status and social goods in the society at large” (8).

Harry Potter fandom lets you be apart of a social network and lets you feel apart of something.

My pieces of language such as sign systems and practices let others know that this is an actual Discourse. Knowing facts like how “Harry Potter got his scar as a baby from Voldemort”, (Pottermore). Knowing this helps you enter this Discourse. Being in a Discourse means you are apart of something and know what is going on within that Discourse and in this case Harry Potter Fandom. Such as, the movies, what the author is writing, what activities Harry Potter has brought a bought into the real world.

Significance is a very important part of Harry Potter and why he is the way he is. Harry Potter Wiki which is a social network that helps fans get more information on the wizarding world helps show what is significant in the books. For example, what is the significance of Harry’s scar on his forehead? Fiano implies that significance is when “the speaker or writer is trying to give significance to things” (67). People not in the Discourse would not know how significant the term “muggle” is in the wizard world of Hogwarts.

“A Muggle is a person who is born into a non-magical family and is incapable of performing magic. Most Muggles are not aware that magic exists at all and that those with it have organized their own society largely separate from the Muggle world” (Harry Potter Wiki).

One in this Discourse would also know that the one of the main characters Hermione is muggle born. Another term for is a “Squib” which is someone “who also lack magic but are born into magical families and are aware of the wizard world” (Harry Potter Wiki).

Acting the Part

A Harry potter fan has to know all the information within the Discourse and has to always be apart of something, weather it is dressing the same way as a character or speaking the same language they do. By doing this a fan feels as one with the characters and like they are apart of Hogwarts. Gee points out that to be apart of a Discourse one should know the language used and not have to be a pretender. “The lack of fluency may very well mark you as a pretender to the social sole instantiated in the Discourse (an outsider with pretensions to being an insider)” (Gee 10). A “pretender” in this Discourse would not know these terms and would most likely use these terms in the wrong way which could also be offensive to people. When it comes to Harry Potter fandom one cannot fake their way in because they would stand out very easily.

Quidditch

Many people not involved with the Harry Potter Discourse would not know that the sport Quidditch which is played at Hogwarts is also played at a competitive level in the real world.

Real world vs. Potter world

The building task of practices is explained by Fiano as “the practice or activity that is relevant in a context and how they are being enacted”(67). The practices that are used throughout the Harry Potter series have inspired the upbringing of the real sport today.

One in the Harry Potter Discourse would know the rules used in the sport in the real world and the one at Hogwarts.

The USQ Rulebook states all the rules within the sport, some rules are similar to the ones in the wizarding world but there are some also different. “Quidditch is a co-ed contact sport with a unique mix of elements from rugby, dodgeball, and tag. A quidditch team is made up of seven athletes who play with brooms between their legs at all times” (US Quidditch). By playing with a broom just like they would at Hogwarts this is an example of how a Potter fan must be engaged at all time and have some sort of connection with the books. Just like in Harry Potter there is also a snitch that is worth 30 pts and a Keeper that defends the goal.

Knowing certain practices in the Discourse can keep you interact with the Discourse and keep updated with what is going on.

Competition

Quidditch is known as an exciting sport in the Wizarding world, and lets the students be able to support their house with pride. Each house competes against each other where it is personal because the players know one another. In the real world it is not as personal because you are playing against teams from other schools.

Involvement

Potter fans always have to be involved with the wizarding world know matter what. This sport being brought from the books/movies to the real world proves the point of how far true Potter fans would go to be in the Discourse. Winning is a large importance in the sport of Quidditch, but being able to play an actual sport from the wizard world means you are truly participating in the Discourse. The connections and practices that Harry Potter fans have brought from the wizarding world to the real world are growing day by day. Practices is one of the “Seven Building Tasks” that fiano believes one should know and be aware of when in a Discourse.

Picking an identity of a character

Favoring a house over the other

Values

“the particular characteristics of students sorted into Gryffindor are courage, chivalry, and determination” (Gryffindor). A member of Slytherin values power, money, and will always follow in their families footsteps.

The fans favor the characters/houses that show their personality. So when looking at what are most favored the identities Potter fans pick usually are Gryffindor members such as Hermione, Ron, and Harry. This is because in the real world we are told to have determination and bravery to be successful. Having certain beliefs is a huge factor when it comes to being in the Discourse because Harry Potter fans must have an identity and be able to have beliefs. Fans must engage in Harry Potter and become one with a character.

Being one with the characters

It is a Discourse

The Harry Potter Discourse is an example of a secondary, non-dominant Discourse because of the large social status it gives a member. This Discourse may not fit all the values of Gee and Fiano but by the artifacts I have given you and the analysis done proves that Harry Potter Fandom is a Discourse.

Many of the seven building tasks are used in the Potter Discourse and also many of Gee’s ideas are also used. Fiano’s building tasks of practices, identities, sign systems and knowledge are used, and Gee’s pretending and beliefs and values are also used.

What you should of learned

It is a Discourse

A Potter fan must be involved with activities

A Potter fan must interact with other fans by going on fan sights on the web or even dressing the part

A potter fan must have artifacts and knowing the signs and knowledge of movies and books

Our $40 Million Pledge to Fix the Leaky Tech Pipeline,"It’s hard to argue with the fact that intellect, creativity, and resourcefulness are evenly distributed by zip code. Unfortunately, access and opportunity are not.

This is embarrassingly apparent in the high-stakes world of tech entrepreneurship. If you line up founders of the top 25 tech “unicorns” — startups now worth more than $1 billion — you won’t see any African American or Latino/a faces, and you will see hardly any women.

That glaring gap was the reason behind today’s first-ever White House Demo Day, an inspiring showcase of successful entrepreneurs whose race, gender or family background makes them stand out from the traditional crop of visionaries. Leaders from Intel, Pinterest, Twilio and many other companies were in attendance, a sign that the tech industry is (finally) getting serious about diversity and inclusion.

At this promising moment, I am proud to announce that the Kapor family of organizations is making a $40 million investment over the next three years to accelerate our work to make tech entrepreneurship more inclusive. We’re doubling down on diversity because it’s good for individuals, communities and the economy as a whole.

Freada and I celebrate the graduation of the College Bound Brotherhood

My wife Freada and I have made it our life’s work to close the opportunity gap in tech. Through our organizations — Kapor Capital, the Kapor Center for Social Impact and the Level Playing Field Institute — we have been at the leading edge of efforts to break down barriers to success in Silicon Valley and the broader tech community.

As we’ve often said, there is both a pipeline problem and a leaky pipeline problem for African Americans, Latina/os and all women in tech. We will take a comprehensive approach, supporting three interrelated pillars:

1) Access to tech education, 2) Access to capital and 3) Strong community institutions.

The first pillar of our investment will focus on high school students. Too many American public schools — more than 85% by one count — fall short in their computer science and engineering offerings. Our schools are failing millions of students who develop an early passion for science or coding, and they are too often failing to stoke that passion in the first place.

SMASH scholars receive academic and technical training, along with the connections they need to pursue their dreams.

For the past 14 years the Level Playing Field Institute has sought to close this gap by operating rigorous STEM-focused college prep programs for low-income students of color. This year, we will invest $6 million to scale and expand the SMASH (Summer Math and Science Honors) Academy, a rigorous five-week summer STEM program that matches underrepresented students with the academic and technical training, resources, role models, and connections they need to pursue their dreams. Ultimately, we want to ensure that every student has a chance to make an impact in the 21st Century economy.

The second pillar of our investment will address the gap in access to funding. Blacks and Latinos make up less than 1% of startup founders who secure venture capital funding.

Over the next three years Kapor Capital will make over $25 million in direct investments in technology startups working to narrow the achievement gaps. At least half of the companies we invest in will have founders from historically underrepresented communities.

Our team at Kapor Capital is itself majority people of color, so our investment decisions and deal flow reflect the unique lived experiences of our team. We will continue to seek out founders with big ideas that have the potential to generate both economic returns and a positive social impact. A few illustrative examples from our portfolio include:

Lendstreet — a lending platform helping borrowers refinance old debt and rebuild their financial lives. Honor — an online platform providing high-quality home care for those who need it while providing fair wages and respectful treatment for home health care providers, and coordinated treatment communications for family members and health care providers. Piazza — an online study group allowing students to ask each other and their professors questions, anonymously if they choose. Now serving more than a million students, Piazza is also a recruiting platform for tech companies. Proven — Proven is a mobile app for finding employment in the restaurant and hospitality industries, allowing job seekers to apply for jobs using their browser or smartphone.

Three of these four companies were founded by an entrepreneur from an underrepresented background; all are committed to closing gaps in access and opportunity. We will continue to seek out founders with big ideas that have the potential to generate both economic returns and a positive social impact.

Construction on the Kapor Center for Social Impact building, Oakland

Finally, we believe that the effort to make entrepreneurship more inclusive will ultimately need to be a local phenomenon. As the third pillar of our investment, The Kapor Center for Social Impact will commit $3 million a year to promoting a more diverse tech ecosystem where our team lives and works, the Bay Area. Our new building, opening this winter in Oakland’s Uptown district, will be a hub for building the startup ecosystem of gap-closing companies, mentoring and networking for underrepresented entrepreneurs, community education, student hackathons, and convenings that leverage the under tapped genius in our backyard.

We hope and believe that our $40 million commitment will encourage others in the tech industry to match and multiply our investments. We have always been early investors, assuming risk at the seed stage in order to prove concept viability to later-term investors. This has been true whether the investments are for profit or non-profit endeavors. In this way our investments have a huge multiplier effect, and we expect that that will be the case with this pledge. Just a few years ago we were virtually alone in this endeavor.

Now, as major tech companies have started to release diversity data, revealing a deep disconnect between their employees and their customers, we are excited to work collaboratively to magnify the effect of our work. For example, we asked Google for Entrepreneurs and Village Capital to co-sponsor a first-of-its-kind pitch competition for startups that leverage technology to make all aspects of employment — from hiring practices to compensation to promotion criteria to complaint tools — less biased. We hope to launch a whole new tech investment sector, often with underrepresented founders, whose products will change the practices of all kinds of companies .

At the end of the day, making tech more inclusive is about more than just accessing untapped talent; it is about rethinking the kind of products that America makes. As we can tap into a wider range of lived experiences, we will see more startups that narrow gaps in our society like Lendstreet, Honor, Piazza, or Proven, and fewer that only serve to widen those gaps.

Imagine how different the tech world would look today if industry leaders had committed to diversity and inclusion a decade ago. Now imagine what it could look like in 10 years if we choose to double down on diversity now.

That is a vision worth investing in, and we invite others to join us.",https://medium.com/kapor-the-bridge/our-40-million-pledge-to-fix-the-leaky-tech-pipeline-f0d3463761d7,['Mitch Kapor'],2015-08-06 11:13:58.482000+00:00,"['Tech', 'Diversity', 'Investing']"
"A Business Lady’s $18,000 A Year Work Studio","by Amy Merrick

That window overlooks the East River and Manhattan, and the view out of it is worth $18K, easy

Truth is, I am a reluctant business owner. There are movers. There are shakers. There are people who can produce a business card from their shirtsleeve with a flick of a wrist. They are not me. Or they were not me. I’ve upped my game and this is how.

It started with a casual Craigslist flirtation. Real estate, I mean. I had been running a successful floral design business from a spare bedroom in my Brooklyn apartment for the better part of a year. Bales of branches, boxes of vases, and a shower filled with 27 — count ’em, 27 — dirty flower buckets waiting to be washed. My personal life was forfeited to a huge mess of dead stems and smelly water. Let’s be real, working from home was turning out to be awful. But it was awfully economical, too.

I had dreamy ideas of a separate work studio — a big, bright one in an old Brooklyn warehouse, charm abounding. My Craigslist search terms started at an arbitrary $800 a month. Prewar. Industrial. Williamsburg. Greenpoint. 700 square feet. I may as well have included the phrases impossible wish and improbable hope. What if I upped my budget to $1,000? And I mean, what’s the difference between $1,000 and $1,200, really? Two pairs of jeans from J. Crew is all. Dollar signs crept higher.

After a week’s worth of flippant perusal, I made a call. You know, just to see. The studio was mediocre at best: $1,200 for 600 square feet, a narrow dark little slip of a space with a plywood floor and fluorescent lights. The studio fulfilled none of my dreams, and left me sad and confused. Maybe this was a bad idea? My business was working okay from home, save for the razor sharp misplaced clippers that would often end up in my bed. Why would I sacrifice my meager profits for a space that would, in the long run, reap me no more business than I could get at home?

I decided then and there a work studio wasn’t for me. I loved the flexibility of being self-employed, and I knew a studio would rob me of that. What if I wanted to say, “eff New York,” and move to Portland for the fall? What would I do with a studio then? No, I was a tried and true commitment phobe, and a studio just didn’t fit in with my lifestyle, even if it was holding my business back.

The problem with being a commitment phobe business owner is that you always have one eye on the exit. It was comforting to know that as long as I worked from home, I’d have to do the bare minimum to stay solvent. A job or two every month coupled with my weekly writing gig would keep me in the clear for the foreseeable future. This thinking worked well for me until the following week.

I got a text message from the broker who had shown me the first studio. He had the “perfect” place for me. Oh, really? And by perfect do you mean a plywood floor and a near complete lack of windows? I texted back by saying huge windows and prewar details were all I wanted. He said yes, meet me at noon.

It was over before it started. I saw 1,000 square feet of exposed brick bliss, with a view directly overlooking the east river and Manhattan, floor-to-ceiling arched windows situated on a corner. At $1,500 a month, it was more than I wanted to spend, and at 1,000 square feet, it pretty much qualified for its own zip code. But I was a goner. Sometimes you cross the finish line before you’re ready to start the race.

Finding the studio of my dreams, quite unexpectedly, threw everything out of balance. I would have to fully commit to making this business work, no more wishy-washy dreams of ditching New York. I’d have to up the ante, hustle and start demanding to be paid a fair amount for my time and expertise. But how on earth could I ensure that the rent wouldn’t crush me? I did a quick calculation — if I were to teach a monthly class (Eureka! Flower classes!) I’d be able to just cover the expense. Plus maybe I could rent a little corner out to a friend? I called the broker and asked him where to sign.

Turns out, where you sign is at the bottom of a 10-page lease. To say I skimmed would be generous. During my glance, the only thing to pop out at me was the number $18,000. The yearly rent? I grabbed my calculator (and by calculator, I mean phone. I do not own a calculator). Turns out $1,500 times 12 is $18,000. Good to know. I quaked and signed.

That was one month ago, and here I sit on the floor of an unfinished studio in a pile of sawdust. My back is leaning up against a radiator and I’m watching the sunset over the river into the Manhattan skyline. To say that the transition has been easy is a lie. I used to fall asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow, now I stay awake, racked with anxiety. I am alone — a 27-year-old country girl at heart, responsible for thousands of dollars worth of New York City real estate, for running a small business while simultaneously feeling that I am too immature to keep a goldfish alive. I called my mom on the way home from a huge magazine photo shoot for a multi-page spread of my flower arrangements, and while I should have been happy, I just couldn’t stop crying. I felt so in over my head. She quietly said, “Amy, the higher you fly, the further you can fall.”

It’s easy to dream big dreams for yourself — that’s why we all do it. Taking risks to actualize those dreams, however, can be paralyzing. My mom’s advice was really just the usual financial analyst standby, “No substantial growth comes without risk.” If I would have fully comprehended that the yearly rent on my flower studio was $18,000, no way, no how would I have signed on the dotted line. I think my impulsiveness was actually a boon for my business, because my motivation has increased dramatically, and I’ve already sought out work that has made it worth my while. Pre-studio, I was happy only to take the jobs that popped into my inbox with no effort extended. Now, I wrack my brain for further ways to push myself. While I’m still afraid of heights, I’m finally learning to appreciate the view.

Learning by Doing,"Kevin Pennant, thanks for offering a dissection of my piece, especially for highlighting my comment that some individual behavior is the manifestation of stress and tension within a group. I’m thinking about how you see “stress and tension” as “the main ingredients for conflict” and the notion of happiness as a zero-sum game.

I’m highlighting this because of a conversation with Todd Hannula, where he is being amazingly receptive to having some of his “white privilege bias” named.

The thing is, everyone (here in Medium, say, to put a boundary in place) is — to a greater or lesser extent — trying to find and express a voice we can live with: intrapersonally (me with myself), interpersonally (me with others generally alike to me), and interculturally (me with others whose differences from me are salient).

Lots of trouble with the last one! Whiteness tends to erase intercultural distinctions.

The concept of valence (that I wrote about in the piece you’re responding to, about the relative simultaneity of events in Paris, Beirut, Yale, and Mizzou) might help with some kind of comprehension of why people are drawn to ‘performing’ or ‘enacting’ one or the other of an established, currently-popular or media-supported, self-replicating discourses (including me! Really, all of us.) To intervene in the reproduction of existing discourses requires detachment from them — the ability to perceive oneself as a contributor to, or co-generator of, the dynamics: me reading you writing to me — which could also be stated you reading me writing to you. It’s a cycle. Sometimes taking a bit of time away and coming back after other things have happened is useful to create an actual tangent in a new/different way rather than simply (quickly) repeating another loop through the same territory.

As I write back to you, Kevin, I’m thinking of a wider audience. (You probably were when you first wrote me, too — whom else do you hope to reach?) I’ve got specific people in mind, such as my partner in this endeavor, Soirée-Leone, those who have liked something we’ve written here on Medium (in particular Jasmine Minaya and Jasmine Y. Kent — who recommended specific entries in this particular thread, also Ben Roberts, Mike Thorpe and Joel Leon. — who said what me and Soiree are trying to do is “smart…emboldened”), people I’ve been more recently engaging with in a similar fashion in Todd’s thread (Jennifer Smith, Jillian C. York, Veronica Montes) and those not yet encountered who might be motivated to undertake a longer dialogue. I’m hoping these folk are similar to you and me, Kevin, in the way you said it, wanting the inflammatory rhetoric stripped away so we can buckle down and deal with asking better/different questions that can actually lead us to new/equitable social systems.

Excuses and defenses and denials are as toxic as hate speech, just more insidious because, in comparison, they exhibit a weak version of tolerance, perhaps what A.D. Carson told Chenjerai Kumanyika sound like “warm coffee voices.” By which I think he meant tepid white people talking around issues with neutral, passionless intonation. (Read the Medium story by Ernesto Aguilar referencing Kumanyiko’s Transom story about the whiteness of public radio; for an extensive list of related references and resources, go here).

Last week I read about “anticipated reproach” and “do-gooder derogation (the putting down of morally motivated others)” as an explanation for the criticism of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative…it struck me as a partial explanation for white fragility, too. Perhaps akin to what you were referring to when you wrote about the resentfulness of whites “as if something intangible would have to be given in exchange”? Many Whites may already be feeling the pinch of guilt for, say, not risking physical harm in protests such as #BlackLivesMatter or even for justifying their relative comfort as “hard-earned” as if structures of white privilege have nothing to do with the opportunities that allow Whites to earn in the first place. Most will just manage their discomfort and go on about their business: not really part of the solution while not overtly exacerbating the problem. A few (percentage-wise) will vocally ‘act out’ and speak the (so-called) unspoken or (supposedly) unspeakable. Just like those who keep silent are playing into the repetition of history, those who speak out will be repeating variations on themes . . . this is where the dynamics can really be brought into view — if enough of us are, like my pal Soiree-Leone, willing to be exposed (gulp) and explore (carefully, reflectively) the correlations we perceive with each other.

This space — as I understand the aims of Medium overall, and Dark Allies in particular — intends to be ‘a place in the middle’ of the typical patterns of interacting, where we can reflect deeply and attempt to work through some of the stickiness and motivate each other to increase and improve our efforts in our own spheres of influence: home, work, local neighborhoods and dispersed communities, all the way up the chain of institutions and government. It’s an open invitation. I have no idea what will come of it, but it seems necessary to try.",https://medium.com/dark-allies/learning-by-doing-4b613709202,['Stephanie Jo Kent'],2015-12-10 02:31:04.291000+00:00,"['Social Justice', 'Psychohistory', 'Partnerships']"
Talko + Slack,"Shortly after our launch we heard from several teams who were using both Slack and Talko daily. We heard from product development teams who do daily “standups”, sales teams who do weekly status calls, event marketers who communicate across event sites, and several others. They described using Slack for team messaging, and Talko for team calling.

These teams were asking for a more integrated way to use Talko and Slack.

So we built it, and a couple months ago we began using it (and loving it!) every day to start our own daily standup calls from Slack. Beta customers helped us refine the integrated user experience over the past few weeks. We’re thankful for the feedback from X Prize Foundation, Litmus, Vision Critical, Nodo Arquitectos, 8:45A, Velocity Growth, and several others.

Today, we’re thrilled to announce that Talko is an “official” Slack integration! It’s now simple to set up, and openly available for any team to start using. The benefits include:

Reliable team calls on mobile or web : Team members’ iPhones immediately ring when a call starts in a Slack channel. Regardless of location or network, everyone can have a reliable, high quality call experience.

: Team members’ iPhones immediately ring when a call starts in a Slack channel. Regardless of location or network, everyone can have a reliable, high quality call experience. Transparent and productive communications: All Talko calls are recorded. Team members who couldn’t be there LIVE can enter later to listen to the entire call or just its important moments. This helps teams stay in sync, remember critical decisions, and get things done quicker.

As a bonus, teams using our Slack integration can take part in team calls via an early beta of our web app. This allows everyone to participate in the most natural way possible. Mobile team members will answer the Talko ring on their iPhone (Android is coming soon), while those at their desktop can choose to use the web app with the Google Chrome browser.

How it Works

Starting a Talko call is as simple as typing “/talko <subject>” in any Slack channel. The subject is optional, but often helpful because it indicates to others what you want to talk about. When you send the slash command, slackbot responds with a link that is visible only to the call creator. Click that link to begin the call.",https://medium.com/talko-team-talk-share-do/talko-slack-23f921f1127b,['Talko Team'],2015-11-07 01:55:30.257000+00:00,"['Mobile', 'Apps', 'Slack']"
Building sites for good SEO and sharing on social networks,"Search Engine Optimizations (SEO) has gotten a bad reputation for cheap tricks that people use to “game the system” to get ahead in search results.

However, there are solid practices that we recommend to consider when building any website. Search algorithms have been evolving fast adopting to mobile growth, and with the rise of social networks we should consider the share-ability of web pages.

Here are few SEO and social sharing tips we use as developers.

Responsive

It’s a mobile world where people use all kinds of devices and screen sizes. Google, the most popular search engine in the world, has started to label sites that are mobile friendly in search results when searching from mobile devices.

To make sure your site sites gets the “Mobile-friendly” label, check for your site the Mobile-Friendly Test offered by Google.

Most search engines have started to use performance as a ranking signal to improve the user experience. This is done because mobile devices are frequently on slower networks, and poorly optimised sites decrease the quality of search results.

“75% of mobile users will leave the site if takes more then 5 seconds to load.” Source

To make sure your site performs well in the eyes of Google, check out your score in the Google Speed Test tool. As a rule of thumb; Aim for the mobile score of 75 / 100 at least.

Google+

Not many people use Google+, but Google Search uses Google+ for additional details in search results. It’s important to setup a solid Google+ profile for companies/products to improve visibility.

The logo, name, map and other information are extracted from the Google+ profile.

Google Maps is often used by people to search for services in specific areas. The Google+ profile information is also used for the map, so a Google Map search by company is made possible and offers details.

Note: Google+ profile updates can take few days to show up in results.

When setting up the Google+ profile, you will be asked to authorise the ownership of your site through the Google Webmasters tool.

Google Webmasters feels clunky and is a bit weird to fumble through. However, it offers useful information about how your site is perceived in the eyes of Google.

Example usages:

Search Analytics

External links to your site

Internal links indexed by Google

robots.txt file tester

Sitemaps file tester

more…

“Get data, tools and diagnostics for a healthy, Google-friendly site.” Google Webmasters

HTTPS

Google has hinted that they might use SSL as a ranking signal for security reasons. This is not confirmed yet, but something to consider.

If you don’t know how to implement HTTPS, you can check out services such as CloudFlare CDN that offer a simple SSL layer as part of their free plan.

Open Graph

When people share links to our site on social networks, we have lots of control over how that information will show up. This is done by using the Open Graph protocol.

The Open Graph protocol is supported by a wide range of social platforms. For a given site, consider the target audience and optimise the Open Graph tags to make sure pages have nice previews.

Here are few documentation pages from popular social sites:

There is a super useful article on the Moz blog on how to combine and test these Open Graph tags when implementing.

Mind the basics

Finally, follow good practises for the site.

Use Progressive Enhancement principles so your site is always accessible by search engines.

Use solid markup and correct tags for their intended purpose. Heading 1 (<h1>) for the main heading, Heading 2 (<h2>) for secondary etc. The HTML validator tool is useful to check and eliminate syntax errors.

The good’ol title tag and description meta tag are shown in search results and also important for indexing, so craft these with gold.

In the end, the quality of content on the site is most likely to determine its SEO and social success.",https://medium.com/14islands/building-sites-for-good-seo-and-sharing-on-social-networks-5eb44c0f6eb8,['Hjörtur Hilmarsson'],2015-12-10 09:30:04.354000+00:00,"['SEO', 'Mobile', 'Web Development']"
Dear Gun Enthusiasts…,"Last week I posted this picture of a billboard I spotted in East Austin.

As you can see, some imaginative individual or individuals with spray paint modified the word “firearms” to “fear.” Texas Fear Festival.

When I spotted the billboard, I did a double take. The alteration was subtle, and it took a minute to sink it. Typical Austin, I chuckled. Often referred to as “a blue dot in a sea of red,” this creative vandalism did not surprise me. The sign is located exactly one mile from The University of Texas at Austin campus, where tensions are currently rising over the recent passing of Senate Bill 11 — the campus carry law. Students plan to bring dildos to school on August 1st, 2016, the day SB 11 goes into effect, to protest the school’s ban on obscenity and not guns. (Note: August 1st is the day that Charles Whitman killed 14 people and wounded 32 others from the UT tower in 1966.)

Though I co-wrote a film called Loves Her Gun, which follows the story of a young woman who falls into gun culture as a means to feel safe after being victim to an attack, I’ve never spoken publicly about guns. My feelings are gray, as many people’s feelings are, avoiding either extreme. I’ve shot a gun at a range, my father owns a handgun and I applaud the responsible men and women I know who own one. I have no interest in the strategic plucking of guns out of of owners’ hands, but America’s system for gun accessibility is not working, and something needs to change. Period. I do not have the answers, and I don’t pretend to. (Here are maybe a few places we can start.)

I shared the photo to my social media profiles thinking that it would get a few laughs. It did get a few laughs, then a bunch of shares, and then an explosion of comments. The producers of the gun show had shared the photo in stride and with humor, but with the sharing came an influx of commenters, a few diplomatic and most not-so-diplomatic:

“Die in a fire feminazi. You could kill yourself.”

“Hmmm…maybe we should practice head-on-curb jamming.”

“Property crime is well done? Stupid libtard.”

“If I would have seen the people responsible for this i would have beat them with an inch of thier life then claimed protection under the good samaritan act.”

There was the gentlemen who claimed Sandy Hook was a hoax, and another who posted a photo of an individual with their head blown apart. There was the man who was proud to be an “ammosexual” over a “homosexual,” and several individuals mentioned how quick “libtards” are to defend black people but hate cops.

My favorites were the man who sent me and another woman a photo of Midol and a man who called me and others “wilted lettuce eaters.”

(It’s only fair to acknowledge that the gun control advocates also resorted to name calling on the thread but refrained from threats, homophobia and racism.)

Naively, as a person who has not publicly jumped into the gun debate, I was surprised at the response the photo received. My “Well done, Austin” was a nod to the creativity of the vandalism, not the vandalism itself. As a fan of culture jamming, I thought it was an excellent example of activism and a great conversation starter (Note: The billboard is now back to its original state). However, my three words angered many. I jumped into the debate on occasion, mostly to shut down any far out claims, but I found myself sad and frustrated.

There were reasonable, articulate pro-gun individuals on the thread, ones that enjoyed a respectable debate, but they were drowned out by a larger voice, a voice full of anger and hate. This voice spoke of hurting others, of telling others to kill themselves. We should all listen to both sides of every argument, that is how we grow and learn, but it becomes difficult to listen to words laced with venom; it’s not fair to the pro-gun individuals who are trying to make a rational argument.

I questioned writing this essay because, I’ll be honest, I was afraid. I was fearful of more wishes of death and fearful of personal attacks. Many of the threats were hard to take seriously, with their lack of adequate spelling and grammar (I received “your stupid” more than I can count), but some of them were real and alarming. And I know that if this post even gets a handful of eyes on it, there will be more of the same.

But I wrote this anyways. I wrote it to tell the loudest sect of the pro-gun movement that there are many of us who are for gun control who are also open to hearing what you have to say. It’s only fair. We may not agree and we may not change our point of view, but we can respect your opinion. We can disagree — with tolerance. It doesn’t have to be one extreme vs. the other extreme.

And if you don’t want to listen to me, please respect your pro-gun peers who are trying to have a rational debate.",https://medium.com/message/dear-gun-enthusiasts-fe98c264d5d9,['Lauren Modery'],2015-10-16 20:15:47.777000+00:00,"['Guns', 'Gun Violence', 'Gun Control']"
Libraries Used in the Top 100 iOS Apps,"I am eternally curious. A big motivation for writing the FLEX debugging tool was to explore other apps and discover how they tackle common problems. On Monday, armed with a jailbroken iPhone and an extended version of FLEX, I ran some analysis on the top 100 free apps in the US App Store.

I started by building up a database of the objective-c classes in each app. The median number of classes per app came in at 1,175. In total, the database contained over 181,000 classes. The app with the most classes had over 15 times the median. I bet you can guess which one that was ;). Each of the top 7 apps by number of classes was made by either Facebook or Google.

Next, I looked for common class names and tried to match them to open source projects and 3rd party libraries. I bucketed nearly 5,000 of the most common classes into over 100 projects.

The most used project by far was the Facebook iOS SDK which appeared in 67 of the 100 apps. Other category leaders included AFNetworking for networking (39) and Crashlytics for crash reporting (38). Several Apple sample code projects show up across many apps, with the most popular being Reachability (38). Finally, evidence of the dependency manager CocoaPods only appeared in 30 apps, indicating that many developers are still adding these projects the old fashioned way. The gist below gives the full list of projects and the number of apps each one appears in.

Exploring other apps is a great way to expand your iOS knowledge. If you’ve ever been curious about what’s in an app, I highly encourage you to dig in and find out for yourself!",https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/libraries-used-in-the-top-100-ios-apps-5b845ad927b7,['Ryan Olson'],2015-10-08 06:13:37.444000+00:00,"['Reverse Engineering', 'iOS', 'iOS App Development']"
#startupstress* Comes From Taking Responsibility For Uncertainty,"Entrepreneurs are not average people. If they were, they’d be the majority, and the majority of people do not start businesses, even in developing countries where running your own business is a necessity rather than a choice, and the ratios of entrepreneurship are highest. (The country with the highest ratio of entrepreneurs is Uganda, at 28% of the population.)

Where entrepreneurship is more of a choice, it has in recent years also become more fashionable. In some European countries, entrepreneurs are the rockstars of the 2010s — everybody wants to be one. But even if more accepted, proper entrepreneurs are no more average than before.

In his book “A First Rate Madness”, Dr. Nassir Ghaemi correlates traits derived from overcoming depression and bipolar disorder to the capacity to lead in extreme circumstances. Leaders such as Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill and Martin Luther King all battled depression and all had abilities that suited them to extreme leadership more than to the status quo. Ghaemi lists these as creativity, empathy, resilience and realism.

Working in and leading a start-up can seem like a war, and it is at the least a hard fight, particularly in disruptive start-ups, where you are not only fighting for funding while you battle to alter consumer behavior, you are also being faced with a powerful establishment aggressively pushing the waves of change back over your head. Creativity, empathy, resilience and realism: all sorely needed, resilience in particular. There is some dissent as to what constitutes resilience. Martin Seligman, the ‘father of positive psychology’ hinges resilience on optimism; Diane Coutu, who has collated learnings that included Victor Frankl’s writing about Holocaust survival and seeking meaning as one of the key components for resilience, finds that realists are the ones who survive extreme circumstances best and longest. Accounts of resilience as well as my personal experience in losing all things material and my business lead me to believe that this duality is at the crux of resilience — an awareness of the potentially negative reality, and an ability to work towards a positive outcome at the same time. A realistic optimism. An awareness of transience. Perspective. That kind of resilient thinking can be practiced, as a discipline, much like the like the tool du jour, mindfulness, enabling us to better face the everyday ups and downs of start-up life.

Start up founders are not average. A personality built for extremes — and often of extremes — is required. “It’s about degrees,” says John D. Gartner, a psychologist and author of “The Hypomanic Edge” in the New York Times. “If you’re manic, you think you’re Jesus. If you’re hypomanic, you think you are God’s gift to technology investing.” Extreme drive, extreme determination, courage, passion, intuition. And, as with all traits, these can work both ways. What drives you and makes you a good and sometimes successful entrepreneur can also be your downfall — be it stubborn determination, or a reliance on intuition, or courage bordering on recklessness. The ego that drives you up can also drive you down. Sometimes it’s worth sticking to your guns, sometimes it’s necessary to pivot. Sometimes your gut is right, sometimes data should be driving your decisions. The kerfuffle is knowing when and which and it is for the founder to own these decisions. This is the very essence of #startupstress. Taking responsibility for uncertainty.

In work with entrepreneurs there is no template, and like much of psychological support, it relies on injecting the missing ingredient. Sometimes we need to counter a lack of confidence, for others the missing ingredient can be the humility to counter an arrogance that does not equal confidence.

There are however commonalities as well, and advice can be summed up in three points, each pertaining to two sides of one trait:

Use your ego positively:

to boost your confidence,

to believe you can achieve when the odds are against you,

to pick yourself up, every hour, every day, again and again;

and kick the downside of your ego out:

put your business first — you’re not out to prove a point, you’re out to run a profitable company,

a good idea doesn’t have to come from you — pivot if you need to,

it’s ok to be wrong, and you can survive failure — it’s only money and pride.

2. Balance your intuition and your data, your heart and your brain.

Your intuition is what will drive you to create and innovate and it can also deceive you into misinterpreting market needs and gaps;

Your intuition is what will help you hire the right people — the ones that will realize your vision — and it can also lead you to hire the wrong people: don’t mistake confidence and enthusiasm for competence.

3. Make your drive, persistence, passion work for you and not against you:

You’ll need to work more than you ever thought was possible, and you’ll need to learn to take breaks against all your instincts;

You will need to know when to keep going even if all is stacked against you, and you will need to know when it’s over and act against every grain of your being, with dignity;

You will need to give your all, and you won’t be able to expect the same of anyone else.

We’ve all gone through the same wringer. Sleepless nights: tick. Seeking reliable team members on limited funds: tick. Not making payroll: tick. Last minute deal delays: tick. Being the last go-to for morale, and drawing it from the last bedraggled cell when you didn’t know there was any left: tick. Making gut decisions and begging the gut to be right: tick.

The start-up experience is quite uniform and we each deal with it drawing on our particular strengths, whether that’s seeking victory over others, or over ourselves. It’s balancing our drivers right that’s the hard part, the success maker or breaker. And that comes down to the founder and how she is able to manage uncertainty.

I’ve been in mentoring start-up founders from my twenties onwards, but it wasn’t until my third venture failed (after two successful previous lives), that I was able to put my experience into context and add more value than the usual compulsively positive cheerleading we were able to offer each other as start-up founders under chronic stress. I’ve worked with dozens of start-up founders and a few recurring themes come up.

A. Attachment to the vision

Many successful start-ups feature products that are far off their original plan — those are the ones whose founders were able to suppress their belief in their original vision when proven wrong, and pivot. The tipping point for pivoting isn’t always easy to determine, as history also teaches us that some start-ups succeeded because they persisted long enough — but if we are at least able to consider another point of view, it becomes easier to gauge the right answer.

B. Cut-off

The same is true for knowing when the fat lady has sung — especially in the face of Thomas Edison’s quote: “Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up”. It’s useful to ask yourself how much you can take — psychologically and financially. (And to always know that at least psychologically you can take a little more than you think.)

C. Resilience

Survival isn’t about how long it takes you to break, it’s about how much you can come back from, and how frequently. For most entrepreneurs that means bouncing back from stress and rejection on a daily basis. Sometimes it’s better to break a little, more frequently, than break a lot much later.

Resilience and recovery can also be practiced and prepared for. If you are accustomed to seeing both sides of the coin, the positive and negative, while charging forth as the warrior every entrepreneur is, you won’t be afraid of the negative. You’ve already seen it.

D. Uncertainty and fear

Uncertainty breeds fear and very often, especially in young entrepreneurs, that fear is dealt with by ignoring it and pretending to be fearless. There is no such thing — or it’s called insanity, which is also one way of being an entrepreneur, though quite risky. The more courageous way is to acknowledge the fear, do your best to harness it positively in the greater scheme of things, and not let it get to you in the small things. Fear is the world’s greatest motivator, might as well make it work for you.

E. Mental toughness and mental illness

Mental toughness is not a vaccine against mental illness. I’ve seen some of the mentally toughest people suffer from depression — in fact some are that tough also because they’ve fought a mental illness in the course of their lives. Every businessperson who has spoken out about depression talks of developing a positive routine for themselves, one that can include talk therapy, medication, exercise, a loving environment, and positive challenges. What companies can do is create awareness, empathy and understanding, including highlighting the positive traits a mental illness can foster — and they are particularly applicable to start-ups.

F. Support network

Only people who’ve been through what you are going through will be able to understand. Fact.

G. Kindness

You’re an entrepreneur. That doesn’t make you Steve Jobs. And even he didn’t need to behave the way he did to do be the genius that he was. It just happened that the two coincided.

In a wider perspective, the [C-tactile afferents (CTs)] may be regarded as an afferent system that is basically concerned with the representation of self, rather than external events, as conjectured by Craig (2002).

A Fly In The Ointment: How Banking Red Tape Undermines Irish Startup Environment,"In the last few years Ireland has taken enormous efforts to make the country more attractive for startups. Low corporate tax, R&D tax credits, support offered by Enterprise Ireland, talent availability (given the presence of huge multinational companies like Google, IBM, Microsoft and many more) and the English language make the country very attractive for startups. Ireland even took the lead in the World Bank “Doing Business” 2012 ranking in the EU for “ease of doing business”, but now we have lost the leadership and I assume banking is one of the reasons behind this drop.

Our Adventure of Opening a Bank Account

In early 2015 together with a couple of friends I started working on a startup. At the end of February we decided to go forward with the launch and we needed to incorporate and open a bank account. It wasn’t my first company in Ireland and I expected the banking part to take a bit longer than the incorporation.

Incorporation went really smoothly — we received certificates in a couple of days, but then banking kicked in… There is not that much of a choice in Ireland: Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and AIB are pretty much the only 3 options available for SME. We decided to go with Ulster Bank as in my experience they have the best internet banking and handy connection to Xero accounting.

We probably don’t have the most typical ownership model for a startup: 2 co-founders and one minor shareholder with one of the co-founders residing in Russia. We filled in printed forms, signed them (our co-founder from Moscow posted me forms and document copies by DHL) and I went to the bank.

The first surprise was that Ulster bank just didn’t have any business customer service in their branches. You communicate with regular customer service employees, who forward your application to the business department. That’s it.

The second surprise was that in order to verify directors’ identities both directors have to show up to the branch in person with original ID. Basically that means that our second co-founder/director has to travel all the way from Russia just to open a bank account. Notary public verified ID apparently wasn’t enough.

We thought we found a workaround for that — to replace our company’s director based in Russia with the locally based one who joined the project. Brilliant! Not really…

We came with our new Irish director to the Ulster Bank branch to open an account and were told that our documentation wasn’t good enough. So they rejected:

Ulster bank private account statements as my proof of address. Any other bank’s statement would work but not their own.

Printed PDFs of private account bank statements from AIB for one of the directors (he opted out from receiving paper statements and had PDFs only). According to Ulster Bank, those are “not originals”.

So the Saga continues. For our next visit to the bank we brought another proof of address (which was fine for Ulster Bank now) and the same AIB bank statements but stamped with an AIB stamp as a verification that they were genuine. Again. Not good enough. We asked a consultant to send them anyway as AIB was unable to produce any other kind of statements in the case when a person has only opted into online statements (apparently, we’re not quite in a paperless world yet!).

In the end Ulster Bank accepted those printed versions of statements. But if you think that was the end of the story, you’re wrong. Ulster Bank replied to us saying that we had a major shareholder in Russia (our initial director) and we needed a set of documents from him anyway. Luckily for us shareholder’s certified copies of the documents did just fine. We were nearly there! Or not quite. Our Moscow-based director was on vacation in Sweden at that point and wanted to visit the public notary there but Ulster Bank urged us that only the public notary in Russia would be acceptable. Fair enough. By now we’ve been trying to open an account for about two months, so 10 extra days wouldn’t make any difference. We’re doing business here, what’s the rush?

When our co-founder/shareholder finally returned from vacation, he made a copy verified by public notary just next day, posted by DHL and … it took another 10 days for Ulster Bank to answer. They were quite surprised that notary public from Moscow had a seal in the Russian language. Indeed.. Why would that be the case? Suspicious Russians are suspicious in everything!

So we were told that the public notary seal must be in English, which is obviously impossible as per Russian legislation. We still haven’t opened a bank account up to date and it has been over 3 months now. You may think that we must go to another bank, but we tried and the application document set they require is even bigger.

Summary

It is really easy to register business in Ireland, but if you have a co-founder, director or major shareholder who lives abroad, you should expect meeting some obstacles. The only option we see now is to ensure everybody is physically based in Ireland, at least for the banking docs submission.

It might seem to you that we have quite a unique company set up with co-founders based in different countries etc. and hence — all the troubles. But in fact, it is not so uncommon these days. And should physical location really matter anyway? Aren’t we living in a global world, where people are connected across the borders and business operations can be done online? I guess, Ireland is just not that place quite yet. Well that’s too bad, because when we could be busy growing business, creating jobs and paying taxes, we’re being busy trying to fight the red tape.",https://medium.com/on-banking/a-fly-in-the-ointment-how-banking-red-tape-undermines-irish-startup-environment-1eb4f1cbded4,['Alexey Rashevskiy'],2015-06-05 12:41:42.740000+00:00,"['Startup', 'Ireland', 'Banking']"
5 Reasons Mobile Click-to-Call is #1 (Say It Like Nacho Libre),"When we talk about mobile marketing, the first thing that comes to mind is consumers constantly talking, texting, and app-ing via their anytime-anywhere devices.

But that is only a part of mobile’s story and portrays only half of mobile’s tremendous marketing potential.

Here’s the funny thing. In addition to all the new fangled uses of smartphones, these phones are actually being used to make phone calls. (Crazy huh?)

Busy moms, dads, professionals click-to-call so they can do things on the go. So what does that mean to you and your business?

It means these mobile users will be valuable when they call your business because you get them at the right time and right place to increase revenue.

Let’s take a moment and think how valuable these mobile callers and why. Mobile is an anytime-anywhere device that provides your business with new ways to create, develop, and sustain ROI-rich relationships. Here’s why Nacho Libre thinks mobile callers are number 1.

1) They Will Be Calling the Most

As of 2012, 70% of all mobile searches result in action within 1 hour. BIA Kelsey says mobile calls to businesses will grow from 20 billion to 70 billion calls. DudaMobile reported that mobile websites generate high call volumes. This is one of the primary ways that mobile users contact businesses for relatively obvious reasons and nearly 20 percent of visits to a mobile-optimized website result in an immediate call to the business.

2) Mobile Callers are Locally Relevant

Seventeen million mobile subscribers, including 76% of the smartphone owners, used location-based check-in. A report portrays that 94% of mobile users have searched locally on their smartphones. From pizza to plumbers, 70% of searches have connected with a business after searching it.

3) Mobile Callers Are Time Relevant

70% of mobile searches lead to action within one hour. It takes one month for the same percentage of desktop users to take action. Here we have some surprising facts. An average person takes 90 minutes to respond to an email but It takes only 90 seconds to respond to a text message, 90% of text messages are read within 3 minutes of being delivered and 91% of all U.S. citizens have their mobile device within reach 24/7.

4) Mobile Callers Are Ready to Buy

Mobile callers are more likely to buy than any other sources. Nearly 80% of smartphone users use their phone to help with shopping, with 74% ultimately making a purchase as a result. Also mobile coupons receive 10 times higher redemption rates than print coupons.

5) Re-marketing Opportunity is AWESOME

Reports indicates that mobile ads perform 4 to 5 times better than online ads in key metrics such as brand favorability, awareness, and purchase intent. Brands using SMS and MMS can reach nearly 95% of mobile phone subscribers on both smartphones and non-smartphones alike. Additional marketing-based activities are even more popular, including receiving special offers by text message (54%) or scanning a QR code (58%).

Mobile is not just for texting, calling and app-ing but its a powerful device for you to catch your customer at the right place and time.. Stats shows that more than a third of U.S. adults own a smartphone, 95% smartphone users search for local business and customer attention span is only 7 sec long. Be ready for the mobile caller.

The Not-So-Gentle Arts,"Gentileschi, Susanna and the Elders, 1610 | Rembrandt, Susanna and the Elders, 1647

In reviewing Susanna, it is crucial to review the status of the female model of the seventeenth century. Stigma was attached to any woman willing to submit herself to the prying scrutiny of an artist.

Even if she was representing a biblical, allegorical, or mythological feminine entity or female protagonist, she was still wilfully subjecting herself to the intense physical observation of the male gaze. If posing in clothes involved high risks to a woman’s reputation, one can only imagine what posing nude would do.

Susanna, as most female female biblical characters are described, was a “virtuous Jewish woman” whose story was used to teach that salvation comes to those who put their trust in God. However, Artemisia used the story to stress instead the dark and depraved nature of men, removing divine intervention, and developing political poles of attention. In the center, we have the defendant, Susanna horrified, disgusted, surprised, and above all, angry at the presence of the Elders — whose gaze projects dismissal and prejudice. Artemisia employs complex political pictorial vocabulary through the symbolic use of an art technique known as chiaroscuro, the juxtaposition of light and shade to create dramatic effect.

Rembrandt, who was also a follower of Caravaggio, painted the scene decades after Gentileschi.

His Susanna is cow-eyed and docile in terror. Her gaze is held by the one witnessing her molestation. She is looking at us.

In contrast, Gentileschi’s Susanna is frightened and repulsed by the menacing Elders. Her gaze does not seek out to another, or tilt up to God, but focuses on an object we cannot see — a weapon or escape of her own device.

Her Susanna would become Judith.

Through the absence of allegory and the allusion to Artemisia’s own rape trial, Artemesia’s representation undermines the traditional masculine identity of Divinity, unmasking the masculine identities as occupiers, not dispensers of Justice.

It is this unique viewpoint, a female gaze in the midst of male contemporaries, that gives Gentileschi’s work its full significance. By exploring notions of sexual politics and justice, Artemisia’s work proves its ongoing relevance, reaching far beyond the realm of the Baroque, with a stark reminder of the power of gender across the ages.",https://medium.com/endless/the-not-so-gentle-arts-5570441e847,[],2015-06-10 17:18:43.651000+00:00,"['History', 'Art', 'Feminism']"
The Hunt for Raleigh’s BEST Bakery,"Yellow Dog Bread Company

Yellow Dog Bread Company was founded by a young couple who simply loved to bake. It took a lot of trial and error for them to get to their final destination — their current storefront on the intersection of Person and Franklin Street in the Mordecai district. Before Yellow Dog had even been thought up, Matt and Tanya Andrews utilized space and equipment in a bakery where they had apprenticed. The couple had exhausted their savings account and they were forced to return to their professional occupations. They nearly sacrificed their dream, but risked it all again for a second try at what they had come to love. Thus, Yellow Dog was born.

Matt and Tanya recently celebrated their bakery’s two-year anniversary on September 9th, sharing their goodies with the public — free drip coffee and cookies for all! They have hearts that are deeply invested into their business, and it shows. They are truly grateful for the bread-lovers who have taken part in their success.

When we visited Yellow Dog, we chose to go in the morning when the freshest and biggest variety of items were available. We were so surprised at the ample parking provided by the shopping center. It’s so hard to get a spot in the city sometimes, but the free parking lot right outside makes it easy to visit whenever you like! When we walked in, we were in awe of the simple beauty it had to offer. From the wall decor to the mod light fixtures, Yellow Dog definitely has a welcoming atmosphere. And don’t forget the pastries! We explored a case full of sticky buns, muffins, scones, croissants, pizza-like focaccia bread, savory stuffed baguettes (yes, stuffed), and more. The back wall had about a dozen freshly-baked types of breads on display. We were in a carb-lover’s heaven.

Out of curiosity, we asked the barista what the most popular items were. Her response? “We run out of almost every item at the end of each day.” This may have made our decision harder, but after consulting each other, Tanya the owner, and the friendly server, we decided to order a fan-favorite: the classic chocolate chip scone. Needless to say, it did NOT let us down! The scone was warm and fluffy, with the perfect amount of chocolate chips. It was also a great size: just one filled both of us up! Overall, we were very pleased with Yellow Dog Bread Co. and are so excited to return and try more of their decadent breads and desserts!

We recommend going in the morning when products are fresh out of the oven, the most variety is available, coffee is hot, and natural lighting is at it’s peak. Bring your laptop so you can settle in and utilize their free wifi to get some work done. They’re open 7–7 Monday through Friday and 8–6 on Saturday.

Persist your data elegantly: U2020 way,"SharedPreferences are great and the easiest way to persist user data on Android. It lets you to store/access primitive preference data in key-value pairs. It supports storing/accessing primitive data: boolean, float, int, long, String, and StringSet (not Array unfortunately).

Almost all Android applications use it. Although usage of the API is straightforward, it has its own problems. When your codebase grows, it becomes really easy to make mistakes because it is initialized and used with String literals.

I will first talk about traditional ways to access SharedPreferences APIs and discuss the problems with all the common approaches. These problems are especially important when the codebase gets bigger.

I will then give another cleaner way to do it using dependency injection. I came across this approach in a great open-source sample app called U2020 from Jake Wharton. It uses Dagger to access SharedPreferences. We will use Dagger 2 in this post. It is the fastest dependency injection library made for Java and Android in mind.

If you already use Dagger, you will find a cleaner and safe way to access SharedPreferences. If you don’t, and want to learn Dagger 2, this is a great post for you because it shows the usefulness of Dagger by providing a real life use-case for it. I promise it doesn’t have Coffee, Heater and Pump example ☺

Traditional Ways

You first need to access an instance of a SharedPreferences class. It can be obtained in 2 different ways:

//Use a static helper method.

PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(Context context); //Or use a method in your Context

getSharedPreferences(String name, int mode)

The first method gives the default SharedPreferences which saves the data to a file named as the package name of the app. With the second method, you have the option to provide the file name of the preferences file and the mode to access it.

And finally, you can get your data like below:

String myValue = prefs.getString(""myKey"", ""deafultValue"");

The problem here is that you have to provide a String key and a default value every time you use it. Most of the developers don’t use a Constants file for these keys and type them over and over again which makes it prone to errors.

Thats why I was creating a separate PrefUtils class in the past with methods like below to prevent errors:

PrefUtils.getMyValue();

PrefUtils.getMyValue(defaultValue);

Having a Utility class for accessing SharedPreferences also has its own problems. First, it gets harder to maintain it when your project gets bigger. Second, since you are using Context, there is a risk to cause a memory leak if it is not implemented properly. And I’ve seen lots of different implementations of this PrefUtils class.

Finally, when you want to store something, you will do something like this:

prefs.edit().putString(""myKey"", ""newValue"").apply();

You may realize that we are making chains of calls here to store a data. For a store operation, you have to use edit() method first (which gives you SharedPreferences.Editor object) then make your changes and finally use apply() or commit() methods. SharedPreferences.Editor object makes sure that preference values remain in a consistent state.

Although there is a lint check for it, you may forget to append apply() method at the end. And you will spend hours to find out why your data is not saved.

The U2020 Way

I really like this method and started to use it on my new projects. It protects you from making errors and makes your code cleaner. It especially goes great when you use it with Dagger.

The advantages are:

Key and the default value are given in the constructor.

Don’t have to keep them in a separate Constants file because they are created only once.

Prevents accidental mistakes.

Beautiful and simple methods like set, get, isSet.

Store enums or more complex custom data.

Here is the code for a StringPreference:

public class StringPreference {

private final SharedPreferences preferences;

private final String key;

private final String defaultValue; ... public StringPreference(@NonNull SharedPreferences preferences,

@NonNull String key,

@Nullable String defaultValue) {

this.preferences = preferences;

this.key = key;

this.defaultValue = defaultValue;

} @Nullable

public String get() {

return preferences.getString(key, defaultValue);

} public boolean isSet() {

return preferences.contains(key);

} public void set(@Nullable String value) {

preferences.edit().putString(key, value).apply();

} public void delete() {

preferences.edit().remove(key).apply();

}

}

And then when you need to read/write your data, you may use it like this:

StringPreference myPref =

new StringPreference(prefs, ""myKey"", ""defaultValue""); String oldValue = mPref.get();

mPref.set(""newValue"");

One disadvantage of this is that you have to instantiate objects of this for every value you want to persist. Be patient! Dagger will come to rescue.

How to use these classes with Dagger 2?

In Dagger, you need to have Modules where you provide your objects to be injected. Almost all Android Dagger projects have ApplicationModule where you provide Application specific objects. (eg. Application, NotificationManager, GoogleApiClient) You can find an example here.

You will probably have a DataModule in your app too. So it is better to provide SharedPreferences in it.

@Module

public final class DataModule { @Provides @Singleton

SharedPreferences provideSharedPreferences(Application app) {

return PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(app);

}

...

}

Notice that we made it a Singleton. That way, provideSharedPreferences method will be called only once.

Application object will be injected here automagically by Dagger since it is provided in the AppModule. Also notice that we are using Application as a Context here to prevent memory leak problems.

Now let’s have a PrefsModule:

@Module(includes = DataModule.class)

public class PrefsModule {



... @Provides @Singleton

StringPreference provideMyValue(SharedPreferences prefs) {

return new StringPreference(prefs, ""myKey"", ""defaultValue"");

}

}

We can provide all our preferences here to be used throughout the application. Keys and default values are only provided at once in this module.

And finally, Inject annotation is used to access it. When you do that, only 1 Singleton instance will be used.

public class MainActivity extends Activity {



@Inject StringPreference myPreference; @Override

protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {

super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); String value = myPreference.get(); }

}

We’ve created separate classes for every data type you want to persist. And then we have 2 Dagger Modules. That may seem to be much, but in the overall I think it is an elegant and safe way to use SharedPreferences.

Welfare Reform Would Benefit Us All,"Several states in the United States are introducing legislation to limit what Welfare recipients can spend their tax-payer funded money on. Other States should follow these states example.

Maine

Governor LePage introduced a new bill to the Maine legislature to reform welfare. Maine Democrats voted down a similar proposal last year, but this year seem to be on the same page as Maine Republicans. This proposal would make it so that recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds could not spend that money on Alcohol, Tobacco, and Gambling (ex: Lottery Tickets). This comes into addition to them instating drug testing for welfare recipients that have prior drug convictions.

This is in conjunction with a measure Maine passed last year. This measure required recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to either work part time (20 hours a week), enter a vocational program or volunteer (20 hours a month) to qualify for SNAP. This brought the number of SNAP beneficiaries down from 12,000 to 2,500 in 12 months.

Kansas

Kansas lawmakers passed a bill this week that would put into law policies that Governor Sam Brownback had already imposed. This bill would make it so that welfare recipients could not use that money on Movies, Alcohol, Swimming Pools, Vacations, Getting their nails done, Tattoos, Piercings and would put a strict $25/day withdrawal limit. In fact every limitation placed within their law is meant to ensure that the funds only go for essentials, which is essentially want they’re intended for.

Missouri

A bill has been introduced to the Missouri legislature, House Bill 813. Many more progressive news sites are absolutely livid about this bill, that would limit SNAP purchases (to exclude soft drinks, energy drinks, steaks, seafood, cookies, and chips). However they fail to notice that the bill was merely only introduced to the legislature, is fairly poorly written and has had no action in just over 2 months.

Others

12 other states have considered instituting drug testing for welfare recipients. These states even include liberal bastions of thought such as New York, Connecticut, Hawaii and Minnesota.

These movements give a lot of credence to government (and individual) accountability. In times of economic downturn, those whom have tight finances should all be adult enough to limit our expenditures to what we truly need to survive. We should expect our Government and, by default, those on Government assistance to do exactly the same. Forcing the Government to “tighten their belts” and limit their expenditures as well as the expenditures of those on Government assistance is simply a logical move, should they not do it themselves.",https://medium.com/founder-s-keepers/welfare-reform-would-benefit-us-all-452aa2bb7d85,['Darren Hertenstein'],2015-04-12 20:28:40.374000+00:00,"['Welfare', 'Welfare Reform', 'Reform']"
Copy-Paste Inc.,"Open your Facebook or Twitter accounts. Stay for ten minutes watching the newsfeed as it goes by. What do you see? Aren’t you tired of reading the same things everywhere? Don’t you have the impulse of unfollowing most of the pages you like and half of your friends? I must confess that I’m tempted everyday.

A couple of weeks ago, we talked about inspiration and the need for fresh ideas. This need applies not only to bloggers but also to any online publication.

We all know journalism is in crisis. In fact, it has been in crisis for decades, but now, new models imposed by the internet have increased the divide. Few people keeps on reading print editions, and they are getting older. Soon enough, nobody will buy newspapers — the way we used to know them — anymore.

While some media have adopted the online formats (some, have even stopped publishing in print), some others still whine and seem to be out of their natural habitat when you see their posts online. In other cases, what we find is even worse, as copying others contents is in vogue.

This copy-pasting of news everywhere might be caused by globalization; There are less news agencies, so every newspaper around the world buys the same news written by the same journalists everywhere. More than that, some newspapers get inspiration on the internet; so they get news out of Twitter trends, memes or whatever, just to bring on more hits to their sites.

The old motto ‘who hits first, hits twice’ is no longer true, as the success of an article will depend on the abilities of your community managers and on the number of followers you have, not on the quality of the article itself. It seems, again, that they haven’t understood the “new” scenario, which it’s been a while since it’s not that new anymore.

As an example, we can find viral videos, like this one of a girl dancing to Aretha Franklin’s R.E.S.P.E.C.T. at a recital.

JP: Oh, well, it’s not a problem. It sort of works out, right? You wanted to ask about the lock in’s, and here we have one tonight.

OCI: Yes, very serendipitous. So it was October 2nd when… what would you call the people attending your church?

JP: Parishioners is a general term, but we call them Angels. Because of the name, you know?

OCI: How many… Angels… were originally scheduled to show up to the lock-in?

JP: We had 25, some adults, but mostly children. But 78 showed up on the 12th, and more came the next day. We had a packed basement, and some folks were staying in the chapel area, sleeping between pews.

OCI: When did you first realize people weren’t planning on leaving the building after the lock in was complete?

JP: Pretty quickly. Normally people bring sleeping bags, stuffed animals, games to play, some snacks. This time people brought much more. Suitcases packed with clothes and some belongings. A lot of people brought those fold up mattresses… I don’t remember what they’re called. They have them in Japan.

OCI: Futons?

JP: Yes, that’s it. A lot of those. Books, games, for the kids, I suppose. By the end of it, we had 113 people staying in the church when eventually we had just hit capacity.

OCI: What did you tell people that came seeking shelter?

JP: That we’d try to make room, and we did, somehow. Eventually people were sharing the areas they had sort of… staked out, I suppose. I’m quite lucky we have such good Angels among our congregation. People were more than willing to share their supplies, bedding, whatever, with people who were coming in with practically nothing.

Everyone was confused, scared, but very kind and generous. I wish I could say that was the norm across the city, but if it was, I don’t think so many people would have come to call.

OCI: You hit a supply shortage towards mid-October, is that correct?

JP: Yes. People were shook up at first. Rationing isn’t something most Americans have ever had to do, but we had some first generation immigrants within our congregation, and they were absolutely instrumental in explaining some of the finer points of survival.

We also had a few volunteers to do what we called “supply runs”. A woman named Maggie and her boyfriend Francisco took whatever bags they could and rummaged through any abandoned food shops nearby. We were surviving on snack cakes and granola bars and dry cereal for the last few days before the army came in.

OCI: Much of the city was out of power for a few days or weeks. How did the church fair in that regard?

JP: Luckily the church has a backup generator, and Quentin was able to set up a… weird pulley device thing. I’m not sure what he did, honestly, but we could crank it for energy. If there was one thing we had in large quantities, it was people with nothing to do.

OCI: What were some of the more difficult things you had to do during the outbreak?

JP: Keeping the children and older kids occupied was hard. Kids are so curious, you know? They’ll only sing and color in books for so long. Eventually we put them to work on little things like counting out rations, or helping Fran figure out menus.

The older kids were a godsend for the kitchen. They would mix soups, bake bread, break eggs, chop vegetables. It’s not easy feeding that many people. That was probably the other thing that was tough. Making sure everyone got fed.

I’d been apart of food drives and I’ve volunteered at the soup kitchen of course, but we knew going into those how many people we were looking at, you know? For this… we simply couldn’t tell how much to make. It took a few tries before we got it right. Mr. Shuyazuki was really helpful in that. He’d been in one of the Japanese camps when he was young.

Really, we just simply wouldn’t have survived without everyone pitching in, doing their part. It’s a great group of people, our Angels.

OCI: How did you make sure nobody infected came in?

JP: Oh, it sounds naive to say it, but we simply didn’t. If someone started to show symptoms, we put them in the office space upstairs- it’s one of the areas of the church with a locked door. We only had two people succumb to the infection, thankfully.

I thank Jesus and everyone else every day that we didn’t have more causalities.

OCI: You mentioned you’ve been spearheading improvements for the church since the outbreak, as well?

JP: Oh yes. Better back up systems, and some bunk beds down in the basement. We’re also building a larger kitchen area, just in case. It’s been really nice for the lock in’s, even if nothing else happens.

OCI: Do you think there might be another outbreak?

JP: I sure hope not, but… well, you can never really know what the Lord’s plan is for us all, right? Best to be prepared, any which way it all shakes out.

Cincinnati Reds and Opening Day; A Brief History,"Opening Day in Baseball is a time-honored tradition. For one town it is a special time of the year and was the start for the entire league.

Cincinnati is the birthplace of America’s favorite past time (baseball) as a professional sport. The Cincinnati Red Stockings, formed in 1867, were the first team to recruit and play nationally (in 1869). They went undefeated from the start of 1869 until June of 1870, holding the only Perfect Season in Professional baseball history by going 65–0 in 1869.

Later, in 1935, Cincinnati hosted the first Night game in MLB history. This happened on May 24th, 80 years ago (1935) at Crosley field against the Philadelphia Philles. The Cincinnati Reds went on to play a night game against all other National League teams that year. The night games increased attendance by 117%, despite a dismal season.

The Cincinnati Reds got the honor, starting consistently in 1970, of becoming the first team to play in MLB by starting a day earlier than all the other Home games. This was something that had happened intermittently since 1939, but had not been a consistent theme to the league until the Big Red Machine era. It is still kicked off by the Opening Day parade, which was a much smaller tradition until 1970, but stopped being the first game of MLB league play in 2007 (due in part to an 8 year agreement with ESPN signed in 2005, which was extended in 2012).

Opening day is still basically a holiday in Cincinnati, even if we no longer get things started for the entire league. If anyone from Major League Baseball reads this: Please consider working closely with the City of Cincinnati in restoring this tradition, generations of Baseball fans in Cincinnati will thank you for it. Moving the parade to Sunday (sometimes Easter Sunday) would be a sacrifice many of us would accept, just to have that coveted first game of league play.

Best of Luck this season, MLB.

What’s it really like to be 18 in America right now?,"This spring, Matter worked with a class of high school seniors in the San Francisco Bay Area to find the answer to that question. Through a series of projects — some written, others visual— the students told their own stories and captured a vibrant portrait of their lives. Here is the result: A raw, raucous and very real of depiction of what it’s like to be an American teen today.

Below, you’ll find a selection of essays, interviews, responses, and group projects. Read the rest in their publication, 18 in the Bay.

Can you use “J-cat” and “Fu Fu” in a sentence? Students teach us their language in their Urban Dictionary.

Seniors advise against overdosing in school, among other words of wisdom in their Survival Guide to High School.

Some wrote about their inspiration, others wrote about traumatic events or life-changing moments. A few chose to write a poem or rap.

We actually got seniors to talk to their parents — about being a single mother, about immigrating to America — and they learned that “it was rough being 18” back then too.

Students used Snapchat and Instagram to document a day in their lives. They illustrated what they think about, how they feel, and what they do in their free time. And everyone snapped a picture at the same time on a Tuesday afternoon.

Then we gave them a tumblr and let them go wild.

An interview with a Google Street View driver,"An interview with a Google Street View driver

“As long as the data gets collected, that’s all that matters.”

In 2007, Google Street View began mirroring our landscapes starting with several cities in the United States. It has since photographed most of Europe, North America, Latin America, and Australia and continues to add new territories to the map.

Checking out Google’s promotional material about this project, you might think the Street View cars were self-driving already, but there is always a worker steering every wheel and witnessing the image capture. Recently, I had the chance to interview a Street View driver over email, on the condition of his anonymity.

How did you get into working as a Street View Driver?

It was through a temp job agency. I was looking for a job after I moved to NYC and went through Craigslist. Found the offer for a driving position, nothing related to the actual job or Google or anything. Once I was approved by the agency, I was contacted by the Streetview team explaining what the job actually entailed. This way they didn’t have a ton of people applying knowing what the job was.

You mentioned you went to the New York International Auto Show with the Street View team. Do you hang out with the other drivers a lot? What’s the community like?

Yes and no. Most of the drivers treated it as an actual temp job and stayed for only a few months. My contract was renewed as I worked hard and knew the streets. I recently moved to NYC but I grew up there, so technically moved back I should say.

The auto show was more just for me to have fun, I love cars. Getting back to the drivers question, I found that most of them were there just to do a job or earn money and didn’t really associate themselves with others. Plus don’t forget, we are usually on our own most of the day driving, so we don’t really see each other too much. On occasion there will be meetings or events when we all meet up. But I haven’t really made any lasting friendships through the job.

How long have you been working for Google? Have there been significant changes in equipment since you started?

Lost track of the time, two years now about? And slight improvements, nothing major. Software updates are a regular thing, and sometime there might be a new medium of travel/photography. For example, when I first started, they were moving on to Streetview teams inside businesses, as well as non-road areas like hiking trails and underwater.

What do you think of Google’s fleet of driverless cars?

Don’t really have an opinion on them. I won’t see them being utilized in my lifetime or probably my kid’s lifetime (if I ever have kids). It’ll be a long time before they are fully legal and have laws set about them/insurance. I wouldn’t want one, I like driving.

How often are you followed by pedestrians?

The car is a moving billboard. Everyone wants to have themselves on an Internet-wide camera. They’re attention-whores. People flip the bird, they’ll moon the camera, sometimes if they know we are in town they’ll make a sign or something. They want to show friends they’ve become a lesser-known internet celebrity than a 10-year-old with a YouTube account primarily watched by their peers and family. It’s insignificant, but to them it’s the world. And it makes my job harder.

I was reading some of your Reddit comments and at one point you mentioned you shot the after pictures in a side-by-side comparison of Hurricane Sandy damage. How do you feel about your role archiving and representing cities this way?

It is fun capturing the city in what I believe will be represented for a long time. It’s a really interesting venture and with all of the emerging technology, it’ll be interesting to see how it progresses and will be utilized. It is really just a novelty, but can be helpful to see what the front of a house or business looks like before you get there.

Does it get boring? How much freedom do you have to take breaks or rest stops?

Anything you do every day eventually gets boring. Traffic sucks of course. And breaks and rest stops are whenever. As long as the data gets collected, that’s all that matters.

What kind of music are you listening to while you work?

Music every so often, it’s actually more audio-books and podcasts. If I’m stuck in one place and can only listen to things, it might as well be informative and interesting. I listen to a ton of NPR podcasts they record, Car Talk is great for example. Stuff You Should Know is really cool as well, love those guys. Rooster Teeth’s Podcast is great as I love video games.

As for music, it’s super random. I love creole jazz, modern rock, 80–90s rock, mushy acoustic songs. It’s basically whatever mood I’m in.

What are the company’s policies around recording activity in violent, illegal, or crisis situations? Are you allowed to intervene?

No different than if it was you driving a regular car. I don’t get involved in anything. I’m not a cop. If I record something that isn’t to the requirements, I go back and record it again. I’ve had some harassing people trying REALLY hard to get into shots and even followed me. I’ve called the cops on them after several warnings.

Could you tell me about the camera in use? It’s video, right? Do you see the footage that is captured? Is it higher-res than what we view on the web?

Erm, hard to explain in that sense. It does take single photos, but it’s doing so at a rapid and continuous pace. So it could technically be considered both. To better explain this, here’s this link: http://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/ I do see what is being captured but don’t usually look at the screen while driving. I usually review it every hour or so. And it is usually higher-res, but it looks different that what the final product looks like. Once it is stitched together, (again the technicality may be different), the actual resolution is higher but the quality is reduced so it doesn’t eat up bandwidth and can load faster.

Are there any images you could share from the car or of the car?

I don’t have any myself. They usually don’t allow you to keep your phone on you and provide their own, so you’re not distracted. I use my iPod for podcasts and music usually, so I don’t have a camera on me most of the time.

Any other unusual obstacles about the job?

Ever heard of what London cab drivers have to go through? They need to learn the streets and plan accordingly without any maps or GPS. I have the luxury of technology, but it’s still very easy to mess up and find yourself at the butt-end of a one-way and you have to go all the way around to get onto that street. It helps knowing the area even with a GPS. Plus in NYC and other big cities, skyscrapers can hurt the GPS reception and also affect its latency.

It’s just like driving a delivery van or pizza car, with the added difficulty of making sure the ball of cameras on top is getting what it needs. Sorry I couldn’t be more helpful with this. Although it’s not an easy job, more than people think, when it comes down to it, it isn’t too rough. When talking about the underwater view or Business View, well that changes everything. Unfortunately I’m not a part of those projects.",https://medium.com/message/an-interview-with-a-google-street-view-driver-240d067a7545,['Joanne Mcneil'],2015-05-28 17:58:17.657000+00:00,"['Cars', 'Google', 'Maps']"
When I Wished I Believed,"I remember the exact peak of my belief in God.

The one moment I felt truly connected to this supreme, invisible, silent being that — I had been taught — created me specifically and wanted only for my eternal happiness. I had just received Communion on the day of my Confirmation into the Catholic Church, and I remember crying as I looked towards the cross and felt the everlasting, unfailing and warm love of Jesus enter my heart.

Ten years later, my heart has gone dark and cold.

And I like it that way.

As most teenagers do, I experimented in college. Not with my sexuality, but with the idea of atheism. It began with one class in which I studied the Bible and other religious works as literature, and then with more classes on the philosophy of religion and eastern religions, until I found myself with a religion minor and without faith.

There wasn’t one moment where the clouds parted and I realized there was no heaven up there. It happened gradually. Logically. After reading historical accounts of the man Jesus of Nazareth — ones I had never come across in all my devout years — I thought, Maybe Jesus wasn’t God, but rather a misguided prophet. That would make more sense. So, I let go of Jesus.

For a while, I held on to the idea of God. A 20-year habit is hard to break. But I continued to study comparative religion and found undeniable similarities in creation stories and sacred myths. I battled against arguments for the existence of God with such solid logic and passion that my professors practically applauded. Finally, intellectual and cultural understanding of religion pushed the last shred of faith out of my mind. I felt free.

Though I feared sharing my lack of belief with my family and most of my friends, I knew I wasn’t alone. As I sat in my college’s library, reading books by Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins, I would receive knowing nods from passersby who also bore this hidden cross of non-belief. It was like a secret club we all belonged to, and the first rule was, of course, to not talk about it.

I like being a non-believer.

(That’s what you have to call it, by the way: a non-believer, or humanist. Somehow, the term “atheist” has become synonymous with “devil worshiper” in some circles, despite its obvious meaning as an a-theist, or one who lacks a belief in gods.)

I find it incredibly freeing to know there is no plan. Nothing is predetermined, there is no such thing as destiny, and I was not specifically created to accomplish one mission on this earth.

Unless there are other life forms out there in the incomprehensibly expansive universe, we’re alone out here. Which is simultaneously terrifying and exhilarating.

There are times, however, when I wished I still believed in God.

I wished I believed in God on the day I stood in my childhood church and put a ring on my new husband’s finger, so I wouldn’t have felt like a liar and a fraud on what was supposed to be the happiest day of my life.

I wished I believed in God as I watched my grandfather struggle to breathe in his hospice bed, my uncle by his side for days, quietly crying as he finally admitted to himself that it was time to let go. I wish I believed so that I could empathize with my grandmother, who wouldn’t stop asking my father why God would let this happen.

I wished I believed in God as I felt my marriage fall apart, despite my best efforts to love as hard as I could, to be the best wife I could. I wish I could have believed that prayer would have magically fixed things, and that someone had the power to reverse all the damage and make us whole again. When I walked into the dark basement of the courthouse and handed over my divorce papers to an indifferent government worker, I wished I could ask God for strength, and to show me the way back to happiness.

Now, as I begin to pick up the pieces and figure out if they should even be arranged in the same manner or if I’m someone completely new, I wish I believed in God so I could have someone to blame and be angry with besides myself — someone to place my trust in, so I wouldn’t have to face the hard work ahead alone.

But despite these wishes, I am comfortable with my atheism.

Instead of a god, I place my trust in humanity. Instead of a god, I ask my family for strength. And I live with the kind of internal peace that can only come from living out the truth you’ve found within yourself: that I am solely responsible for the losses and victories in my life.

And I get to decide what happens next.",https://medium.com/bigger-picture/when-i-wished-i-believed-ed6b8912c48,['Katy Widmer'],2015-10-08 12:37:14.124000+00:00,"['Atheism', 'Religion', 'Faith']"
How Facebook’s Algorithm Suppresses Content Diversity (Modestly) and How the Newsfeed Rules Your Clicks,"Today, three researchers at Facebook published an article in Science on how Facebook’s newsfeed algorithm suppresses the amount of “cross-cutting” (i.e. likely to cause disagreement) news articles a person sees. I read a lot of academic research, and usually, the researchers are at a pains to highlight their findings. This one buries them as deep as it could, using a mix of convoluted language and irrelevant comparisons. So, first order of business is spelling out what they found. Also, for another important evaluation — with some overlap to this one — go read this post by University of Michigan professor Christian Sandvig.

The most important finding, if you ask me, is buried in an appendix. Here’s the chart showing that the higher an item is in the newsfeed, the more likely it is clicked on.

Notice how steep the curve is. The higher the link, more (a lot more) likely it will be clicked on. You live and die by placement, determined by the newsfeed algorithm. (The effect, as Sean J. Taylor correctly notes, is a combination of placement, and the fact that the algorithm is guessing what you would like). This was already known, mostly, but it’s great to have it confirmed by Facebook researchers (the study was solely authored by Facebook employees).

The most important caveat that is buried is that this study is not about all of Facebook users, despite language at the end that’s quite misleading. The researchers end their paper with: “Finally, we conclusively establish that on average in the context of Facebook…” No. The research was conducted on a small, skewed subset of Facebook users who chose to self-identify their political affiliation on Facebook and regularly log on to Facebook, about ~4% of the population available for the study. This is super important because this sampling confounds the dependent variable.

The gold standard of sampling is random, where every unit has equal chance of selection, which allows us to do amazing things like predict elections with tiny samples of thousands. Sometimes, researchers use convenience samples — whomever they can find easily — and those can be okay, or not, depending on how typical the sample ends up being compared to the universe. Sometimes, in cases like this, the sampling affects behavior: people who self-identify their politics are almost certainly going to behave quite differently, on average, than people who do not, when it comes to the behavior in question which is sharing and clicking through ideologically challenging content. So, everything in this study applies only to that small subsample of unusual people. (Here’s a post by the always excellent Eszter Hargittai unpacking the sampling issue further.) The study is still interesting, and important, but it is not a study that can generalize to Facebook users. Hopefully that can be a future study.

What does the study actually say?

Here’s the key finding: Facebook researchers conclusively show that Facebook’s newsfeed algorithm decreases ideologically diverse, cross-cutting content people see from their social networks on Facebook by a measurable amount. The researchers report that exposure to diverse content is suppressed by Facebook’s algorithm by 8% for self-identified liberals and by 5% for self-identified conservatives. Or, as Christian Sandvig puts it, “the algorithm filters out 1 in 20 cross-cutting hard news stories that a self-identified conservative sees (or 5%) and 1 in 13 cross-cutting hard news stories that a self-identified liberal sees (8%).” You are seeing fewer news items that you’d disagree with which are shared by your friends because the algorithm is not showing them to you.

Facebook researchers conclusively show that Facebook’s newsfeed algorithm decreases ideologically diverse, cross-cutting content people see from their social networks on Facebook by a measurable amount. The researchers report that exposure to diverse content is suppressed by Facebook’s algorithm by 8% for self-identified liberals and by 5% for self-identified conservatives. Or, as Christian Sandvig puts it, “the algorithm that a self-identified conservative sees (or 5%) and cross-cutting hard news stories that a self-identified liberal sees (8%).” You are seeing fewer news items that you’d disagree with which are shared by your friends because the algorithm is not showing them to you. Now, here’s the part which will likely confuse everyone, but it should not. The researchers also report a separate finding that individual choice to limit exposure through clicking behavior results in exposure to 6% less diverse content for liberals and 17% less diverse content for conservatives.

Are you with me? One novel finding is that the newsfeed algorithm (modestly) suppresses diverse content, and another crucial and also novel finding is that placement in the feed is (strongly) influential of click-through rates.

Researchers then replicate and confirm a well-known, uncontested and long-established finding which is that people have a tendency to avoid content that challenges their beliefs. Then, confusingly, the researchers compare whether algorithm suppression effect size is stronger than people choosing what to click, and have a lot of language that leads Christian Sandvig to call this the “it’s not our fault” study. I cannot remember a worse apples to oranges comparison I’ve seen recently, especially since these two dynamics, algorithmic suppression and individual choice, have cumulative effects.

Comparing the individual choice to algorithmic suppression is like asking about the amount of trans fatty acids in french fries, a newly-added ingredient to the menu, and being told that hamburgers, which have long been on the menu, also have trans-fatty acids — an undisputed, scientifically uncontested and non-controversial fact. Individual self-selection in news sources long predates the Internet, and is a well-known, long-identified and well-studied phenomenon. Its scientific standing has never been in question. However, the role of Facebook’s algorithm in this process is a new — and important — issue. Just as the medical profession would be concerned about the amount of trans-fatty acids in the new item, french fries, as well as in the existing hamburgers, researchers should obviously be interested in algorithmic effects in suppressing diversity, in addition to long-standing research on individual choice, since the effects are cumulative. An addition, not a comparison, is warranted.

Imagine this (imperfect) analogy where many people were complaining, say, a washing machine has a faulty mechanism that sometimes destroys clothes. Now imagine washing machine company research paper which finds this claim is correct for a small subsample of these washing machines, and quantifies that effect, but also looks into how many people throw out their clothes before they are totally worn out, a well-established, undisputed fact in the scientific literature. The correct headline would not be “people throwing out used clothes damages more dresses than the the faulty washing machine mechanism.” And if this subsample was drawn from one small factory located everywhere else than all the other factories that manufacture the same brand, and produced only 4% of the devices, the headline would not refer to all washing machines, and the paper would not (should not) conclude with a claim about the average washing machine.

Also, in passing the paper’s conclusion appears misstated. Even though the comparison between personal choice and algorithmic effects is not very relevant, the result is mixed, rather than “conclusively establish[ing] that on average in the context of Facebook individual choices more than algorithms limit exposure to attitude-challenging content”. For self-identified liberals, the algorithm was a stronger suppressor of diversity (8% vs. 6%) while for self-identified conservatives, it was a weaker one (5% vs 17%).)

Also, as Christian Sandvig states in this post, and Nathan Jurgenson in this important post here, and David Lazer in the introduction to the piece in Science explore deeply, the Facebook researchers are not studying some neutral phenomenon that exists outside of Facebook’s control. The algorithm is designed by Facebook, and is occasionally re-arranged, sometimes to the devastation of groups who cannot pay-to-play for that all important positioning. I’m glad that Facebook is choosing to publish such findings, but I cannot but shake my head about how the real findings are buried, and irrelevant comparisons take up the conclusion. Overall, from all aspects, this study confirms that for this slice of politically-engaged sub-population, Facebook’s algorithm is a modest suppressor of diversity of content people see on Facebook, and that newsfeed placement is a profoundly powerful gatekeeper for click-through rates. This, not all the roundabout conversation about people’s choices, is the news.

Late Addition: Contrary to some people’s impressions, I am not arguing against all uses of algorithms in making choices in what we see online. The questions that concern me are how these algorithms work, what their effects are, who controls them, and what are the values that go into the design choices. At a personal level, I’d love to have the choice to set my newsfeed algorithm to “please show me more content I’d likely disagree with” — something the researchers prove that Facebook is able to do.",https://medium.com/message/how-facebook-s-algorithm-suppresses-content-diversity-modestly-how-the-newsfeed-rules-the-clicks-b5f8a4bb7bab,['Zeynep Tufekci'],2015-05-07 22:57:19.612000+00:00,"['Facebook', 'Science', 'Algorithms']"
"Day 13, #NaNoWriMo: Line by Line Listening, Sniffing, Licking, Touching","That title sounds progressively more sexual, but I think I’ll keep it, because good writing makes you want to do all of these things, no, it makes you feel like you are doing these things. When writing falls flat, sometimes it’s because, as readers, we’re not getting into the sensual experience of the character. So, on rough days, I just go through the senses and think, okay, do we have a visual picture here . . . how about smell, taste, touch, hearing?

The first, most basic question is: can my readers see through my character’s eyes? Sometimes they can’t. Sometimes the character is sharing a bunch of thoughts and the readers are hovering in the air, blind, waiting to see. Like right now. You can’t see through my eyes. But how about this. . .

I’m sitting in Starbucks on a beige plether bench. My phone is on one side of my laptop and my tall soy decaf latte is on the other side. I didn’t tell the barista my name was Merry Christmas. I said it was Kim. So that’s what he wrote. If I look up from my table, I see a ridiculous map of The Coffee Belt, all the world’s coffee growing regions. They don’t mark the areas where they are using slave labor for their coffee beans, and now that I think of this, I feel guilty about my coffee. I miss the local art they used to have on the walls. Two twenty-something guys sit next to me, both of them hunched over, with their phones on their laps, under the table, like they’re hiding their phones from one another. Maybe they’re texting the same girl. One of them gave me this creepy, stoned look when I sat down. He has shaggy brown hair and I almost didn’t sit here, but there were no other free tables. Okay, you have a visual? Go to the next sense.

What does your character hear? Dialogue is easy. But what about the ambient noise? Street noise? Irritating noise? In my case, I can hear the satisfying tapping of my fingers on the keyboard, and I’m trying to ignore the weird music, a little more interesting than muzak, but still slightly irritating. It’s muzak with drumming and chanting. Usually this Starbucks has good music. If you come at 5:30 in the morning, they blast R & B or heavy metal. Which I find inspiring. Now a girl just sat down next to me and she’s speaking loudly on her cell phone, while she squeezes a disgusting wadded-up piece of toilet paper in one hand. If I were writing fiction, not every one of these sounds might be relevant, but I’d choose one or two of them, based on my character’s perceptions.

Now ask yourself about smells. I’ve got an overwhelming coffee smell going on, of course, but someone just opened the door, and a blast of cold air hit my bare legs, and carried with it the smell of cigarette smoke outside. My husband just sat down opposite me. We’re going out for dinner now at a Korean restaurant. When I kissed him just now, I smelled his face. Is that weird? Maybe it’s weird. I always smell him. I smell my kids too. If I knew you well enough and I gave you a hug, I’d probably smell you too, maybe enjoy the smell of your freshly washed hair. (Though you wouldn’t know I smelled you. Because that would be creepy.)

Don’t forget to make your characters eat. I gulp down the last of my coffee, soy milk with what people say is burned coffee beans. I like the taste of it. I know that makes me very every-American, not cosmopolitan, but I like Starbucks. The people who work here are friendly. They don’t act like I’m lucky they’re making me a coffee and not throwing it in my face and I like nice people, or at least, I like people who are good at pretending to be nice. And now I’ll go eat some spicy bibimbop. Maybe your character isn’t eating anything. Maybe her mouth is sticky and filled with morning breath. You might not write it down, but you should know it.

Think about what your character is touching. Give textures. Hot or cold. Clothing. The feeling of the hard wood chair under the character’s butt or the cold sand under his feet. Get into your character’s body. Right now, my butt is super hot. This cushion is warm. The person who sits down here after me is in for a hot butt treat. It’s time for me to head to the restaurant. I’m about to stand up. A tall man with a beak nose is looking around for a seat. I guess I’ll tell him he can sit here and I warmed the seat up for him. Is that weird? Maybe it is. But that too is part of being a novelist. Allowing yourself to be weird, so that your characters, too, can break out of the ordinary.",https://medium.com/nanowrimo/day-13-nanowrimo-line-by-line-listening-sniffing-licking-touching-6f47dc2c1346,['Kim Purcell'],2015-11-17 04:07:44.237000+00:00,"['NaNoWriMo', 'Fiction', 'Short Story']"
Wisdom I Wish I’d Heard As A 1st Grader,"1. Think ahead

Listen kid, you may not know exactly what a 401k is yet — hell, I’m 36 and I’m still not quite sure. That doesn’t matter, if there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s to start contributing to your 401k early. Tell your neighbor who runs the lemonade stand that if he wants you to work 20 hours over the weekend when you could be coloring or picking up chicks, he better match a minimum of 4% every other week. Otherwise you need to stop, drop and open up shop with a better lemonade stand right next to his that also has Arnold Palmers. Capitalism 101. Related, you should buy life insurance now while it’s really cheap.

2. Go green

I may not still be on this earth in 30 years, but you will be. Why should I take care of the environment? The literal weight of the world is on your shoulders, not mine. You may want to give up the Ford F150 Powerwheels and switch to the Prius one or a toy car with pedals. The amount of electricity you use each ride to the playground is only making our energy crisis worse. Your boy George is curious why you’re contributing to ruining his natural habitat. No pressure — just something to think about during nap time.

3. Be nice to everyone

Be nice to your teacher. Be nice to your mother. Be nice to the lunch lady. You know the smelly kid who shows up every day with mac n’ cheese all over his face? The one who picks his nose and then wipes it on the bottom of his cubby to make a booger collection? The one who brings in caterpillars hoping they’ll turn into butterflies, but every single time they turn into a moth and he lets it out in the classroom so your teacher has to kill it? Be nice to him too. You don’t want to be the reason he comes in with a gun junior year of high school. Let that be the pretty girl who knows she’s pretty so she treats people horribly.

4. Learn to code

You’re in first grade. This isn’t preschool anymore. If you don’t know how to code, you should pretty much give up on making it to third grade. You know Adam Finch? He built his own app that can warn his mom up to five minutes before he throws a tantrum over missing Legos. What have you done? Every year, younger and younger people become billionaires. If you don’t know how to code, how are you going to get seed funding? Honestly, you should be ashamed of yourself. You’re already behind the curve.

5. Move to New York

Now. You have to do it while you’re young, then get out before you have a family. 1st grade is the perfect chance, especially if you can find an affordable sublet with a washer dryer included. Living in New York toughens you up — ask any middle schooler: the moment they grew up was when they witnessed their first 1am street fight between junkies in the East Village. Also, go gentrify a neighborhood. By the time you’re in college it’ll be full of hipsters and craft apple juice bars.

6. Get to know your neighbors

So you’re going to live in New York (see above). You better know who you’re living near. Sex offenders are all around us, and a lot of them would love nothing like some fresh 1st grade meat. You need to know which of your neighbors have criminal backgrounds. Then, you need to be nice to them (see #3). Hang out with them, cook them dinner but don’t let them convince you that they’re a doctor. You don’t want them to come for you because they thought you were pretentious and condescending.

7. Embrace your flaws

You can’t write in cursive, you don’t know the periodic table of elements, you don’t even know how to file your taxes, you dumbass. This is all fine. By knowing your weaknesses and flaws, you can truly understand yourself. Maybe you have commitment issues and can’t decide which Hotwheels car you want. Perfect. Tell that kindergarden girl that you can’t put a ring pop on it yet. Maybe you have a lisp. Avoid Chinatown when you move to New York, so they don’t think you’re mocking them. Only when you know your flaws can you find your strengths.

8. Find ways to save money

You’re young and naive. You’ll get spam emails telling you that for just $9 a month you can get unlimited access to the best of MILFs with eyepatches. Well, you can save that $9 from the Arnold Palmers and put it into your 401K, because what they don’t tell you in first grade is that there is free porn ALL OVER THE INTERNET. Seriously — 40% of the internet is porn. The fact that you ended up here instead of looking at porn is pretty much divine intervention.

9. Work can always wait

Teachers and bosses will try to say, “You need to know simple addition to live” or, “If you don’t learn how to read, nobody will respect you.” None of that is true — look at Floyd Mayweather. That can all wait until you’re 40. Live in the moment — not in yesterday or tomorrow. How did you even build a time machine that would let you do that? Can I see your code on that?",https://medium.com/endless/wisdom-i-wish-i-d-heard-as-a-1st-grader-e2d79b9288dd,['Brent Goldman'],2015-05-29 13:28:04.620000+00:00,"['Humor', 'Comedy', 'Advice']"
The Opening of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Is Amazzzziiinnngggg,"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert premiered on CBS this week. So far, I love it — along with Colbert’s boundless energy and optimism, which were often (understandably) lost amidst his conservative blowhard persona from The Colbert Report. But rather than consider the host or his performance or the show’s ratings, all of which social/new media have already analyzed to death, I want to pay tribute to the Late Show’s opening credits.

Most late-night openings present a series of quick shots of the hosts running through nighttime street scenes in New York or Los Angeles. Then, they rely on out-of-focus shots as background plates for guest names. See the NBC shows in particular here — Seth Meyers’ and Jimmy Fallon’s. They don’t tell much of a story. James Corden’s Late Late Show titles are an interesting twist on that trope, stressing the camaraderie between the host and the band leader. Still, they’re awfully short.

The opening credits for The Late Show, however, are on another level. Watch them here around min. 05:40.

Or you could watch them here.

Consider the visuals. Tilt-shift and stop-motion photography are not what viewers normally expect from a late-night opening credit sequence. Sure, they’ve become tropes in online photo blogs like 500px or Flickr, but on late-night TV, they’re new and refreshing — especially when compared to every other similar show out there.

Check out the details:

the focus pulling and zooming which draw attention to parts of the frame as they work in concert with stop-motion and CGI

little Stephen Colbert’s tossing a basketball to a waiting Jon Batiste who, then, dunks it on a neighboring rooftop

Stephen’s dancing while Batiste plays a rooftop piano

the transition from day to night as the camera works its way to the giant COLBERT marquee outside the Ed Sullivan Theater

While I’m not 100% sure, this all appears to be a combination of CGI, miniature work, and actual time-lapse and tilt-shift footage. And by not relying on the same trick for too long, everything blends in nicely.

For example, notice how the names of the guests are integrated. They’re not just GIANT LETTERS that appear onscreen. In fact, they look smaller than usual. But, they’re eye-catching in other ways.

The first guest’s name on the airport runway is highlighted by the planes taking off over it, leading the eye from left to right so it doesn’t have to fill the frame. The musical guest’s name is on a moving train. If you pause the credits and look closely, you can see the band members inside the gondolas labelled “Jon Batiste” and “Stay Human”. They’re small, but I paused to do a double take, so consider my attention grabbed.

Significantly, Colbert’s opening features DAYLIGHT: it’s bright and sunny and cheerful. This is vastly different from the opening credits of every other late-night show, which often feature dark scenes from outside local bars. No, Colbert’s sequence doesn’t just show people having fun; fun integrates itself into the nooks and crannies of every frame.

Finally, Colbert’s theme song is catchy and danceable in a way that Fallon’s isn’t (which is a shame because The Roots are still the best house band on late night…for now). But the new theme isn’t just an earworm; the rhythm and Batiste’s melodica line immediately evoke friendliness, warmth, and joy. The background music is cool, but cool isn’t the first descriptor you’d probably use. Coupled with the daytime setting and the stop-motion/tilt-shift visuals making New York look like a toy set, it puts the audience immediately at ease.",https://medium.com/the-outtake/the-new-late-show-opening-is-amazzzziiinnngggg-c5de0cfa84a8,['Hugo Wong'],2015-12-14 19:39:05.546000+00:00,"['Photography', 'Stephen Colbert', 'Television']"
Communicating the WHY,"I work in a communications role at my church. It’s kind of hard to pin down what I do exactly…I wear a lot of hats. But basically, I’m responsible for making sure the gospel message our pastors are preaching reaches its audience, using a variety of mediums to get there.

This “communications role” has evolved over time, but in the space of one night, the way I went about doing my job was completely revolutionised, and it started with this TED Talk (watch it below).

In this talk, the speaker presents his “Golden Circle” model of getting a message across. It’s a great talk, and with 24 million hits, there are clearly others who think so too, but it’s actually not a new idea.

The idea is this: start with the “why”.

A big part of my job had always been communicating to the church about our upcoming events, whether that be through email newsletters, making brochures, or promotional videos. My advertisements would go something like this:

[TITLE OF EVENT]

Come along to [EVENT] on the [DATE] at [LOCATION].

For [AUDIENCE/DEMOGRAPHIC]

[COST]

[ANY EXTRA INFO HERE]

And I thought people would just come along! I mean, it was going to be a great event! They’d love it! And they should want to come too, if they truly want to grow and mature as Christians! Plus, I’d clearly demonstrated the legitimacy and value of the event with all the effort I put into design, typography, color palette and layout.

But this talk was the start of me realising that, for the most part, people will only come along to something if they are persuaded, and are captured by the why of an event.

You will always get your hard-core faithful, who will turn up to any event, most likely early, and will always be the last to leave. But for your average Christian, still maturing on their journey, they probably need to be convinced.

Why is this event happening? What is its purpose? Why is it worth my time? Why could I not just attend a similar alternative? What’s so special about this? Why should I sacrifice my time to attend? These are the kinds of questions our audience need answered before they can get excited about attending an event.

I could sit here and explain the psychology behind it all, giving examples of successful companies who have been doing this for years, but you’re better off listening for yourself. Take 20 minutes to watch this video, and hopefully you’ll see why this is the way I now advertise all our events.

Predictable Kate

Kate writes for a newspaper where I sometimes pick up freelance work. She’s a business writer, with a calm and professional demeanor. In some ways, Kate tries a bit too hard to be taken seriously, but I understand why. She’s in her early twenties, trying to survive in a struggling field. She wears current, fashionably sedate, business attire: slacks, flats, and dress shirts that mimic menswear. With her short brown hair and piercing green eyes, the look works, but she seems oblivious to how attractive she is.

We run into each other once or twice a month and usually have a quick cup of coffee and chat in the empty break room.

It was a Thursday afternoon when I ran into Kate.

“How about going across the street?” she asked. “I’d rather not talk here.”

That was unusual for her, so I leapt to the conclusion that more cuts were coming to the newsroom. Kate led me across the street to the chain coffee shop, where we could talk.

“What’s wrong?” I asked, prepared to comfort her with reassurances that freelance work wasn’t so bad.

“Nothing. At least I don’t think so. Maybe something. I’m so confused.”

Coffee shops are apparently the modern confessionals. At least, they are where I hear a great many. We sat down with our mochas, as I wasn’t in a chai latte mood, and we sat in silence for a bit.

“I know you research relationship things. I have a question about if something is normal or okay or what.” Kate was uncharacteristically anxious.

I nodded and then placed a hand on hers.

“My boyfriend had phone sex with my roommate.”

“And you’re not sure if that’s a problem? I believe it is for most people.” I patted her hand. “But there’s something more to it, isn’t there?”

“Yes. It’s not like it was behind my back or anything. Let me explain.” She inhaled and exhaled slowly, twice. “Jill and I share a landline. It came with the cable bundle. It’s really practical choice — ”

“Kate, skip to what you need to share,” I interrupted. “Relax and just tell me the story and we’ll discuss it.”

And so, with my gentle nudging, Kate jumped ahead to the cause of her anxiety. Her voice wavered as she spoke. She took yet another deep breath and began….

Kate’s Story

Todd and I were finishing our weekly call. He’s still in school back home, working on a graduate degree in statistics. As you can probably guess, we both like our routines. Every Sunday night at 10 o’clock, I sit on my bed, call him up, and we talk about our respective weeks. Then, we say goodbye and trade emails and messages for the rest of the week.

“I’ll see you in a week,” Todd promised.

He visits the third weekend of every month. I really look forward to those few days together. Todd arrives late Friday, after the long drive, and we generally cuddle up and go to sleep. We wake up late the next morning, then go to the park, a museum, or just sit around and do nothing. He has to leave Sunday afternoon, sadly. Todd always calls the moment he gets home safely, though.

That night we were saying our goodbyes when suddenly there were the beeps of someone dialing the phone. The push-button tones stopped our conversation mid-sentence.

“What the hell?” I probably yelled, covering the receiver.

“Oh. Sorry, Katie.” My roommate Jill quickly apologized from the kitchen. “You two are usually done within 20 minutes or less. I mean, well, your calls are over quickly.”

Jill and I are the Odd Couple. She doesn’t remember to do her dishes, leaves clothes wherever she removes them, and walks around the apartment in next-to-nothing. A few times she’s forgotten that Todd is visiting and walked out of her room in nothing but panties. And it didn’t even faze her. She apologized and went back to put a top on, but her choice of tops aren’t that modest.

I uncovered the receiver. “Sorry, Todd.”

“She’s right. We do kept the calls short,” Todd acknowledged. “We are — ”

“Predictable,” Jill’s voice chimed in.

“Yes. Predictable.”

“Excuse me,” I interjected. “Jill, I was saying goodbye to Todd.”

“Seriously? That’s all you were going to say? That’s just pitiful, Katie. Do more than that.”

“Jill!”

“Don’t you two ever need to get a little wild? Damn, I sure do. Freddie and I know how to say goodbye.”

If there’s one thing Jill isn’t, it is restrained. I usually leave the apartment if she’s on the phone with Freddie, who travels a lot. Even with her door closed, and that means I close it for her, you can hear her. I know what she’s doing, and it makes me feel a bit awkward that she doesn’t care that I can hear. I’m glad that when Freddie isn’t on the road, she spends nights at his apartment. The few times they’ve come back to our place, it was… loud.

“Thanks, Jill, but we know how to say goodbye.”

“Oh, please. No you don’t. Katie, don’t you ever want to just tell him that you look forward to making love the next time Todd’s here? Don’t you want him all eager to see you again?”

“I am eager to see Kate,” Todd assured us, his voice meek and somewhat sad. That wasn’t the tone I had wanted to hear. At the very least, I wanted Todd to sound excited to spend time with me.

“I’ll see you soon,” I offered, without much enthusiasm. I told myself it was the result of Jill’s interruption. “Bye, Todd.”

“Goodnight, Kate.”

“Oh, hell no. No, no, and no. You two are not ending a phone call like that. Talk about dead fish.” Jill mocked us with a monotone, “‘Bye, Todd…. Goodnight, Kate’. What the fuck is that?”

“How we say goodbye isn’t really any of your business, Jill,” I responded tersely.

“Kate, don’t be offended. I’m sure Jill means well.”

“See? You guys need help. You might both be smart, but you’re pretty stupid about how to have a good phone call. You want to know how to really say goodbye, Katie? I’ll tell you.”

I could feel my neck muscles tense. My patience was wearing thin. I started to disconnect the call.

“How should we say goodbye?” Todd asked.

“Don’t encourage her!” I growled. “We don’t — .”

“I’d tell you, ‘Todd, I really can’t wait to kiss you all over. I can’t wait to feel your arms around me while we kiss. I count the hours until I get to see you again.’ Something like that.”

Come on, I thought, that is the most fake, most absurd thing to say imaginable.

“That’s… nice,” Todd said.

How could Todd not notice how stupid Jill’s little flirtation sounded? Maybe I should have ended the call. Or maybe not. I clenched a fist, but didn’t say anything.

“What else would you say?” Todd asked.

“Hey! Todd, don’t let her tell us how our relationship should be.”

“I’m just curious,” he pleaded.

And, of course, Jill kept on talking.

“I’d get you all worked up, telling you that when you arrive I’m going to slam the door behind you, push you against the wall, and kiss you like you’ve never been kissed before. My tongue is going — .”

“Okay, that’s enough. Your tongue isn’t doing a thing to my boyfriend!” I protested. Well, I probably screamed. I can’t remember being so pissed off as I was at that moment.

“I’m sorry,” Jill answered. “Not my tongue, of course. Your tongue, Katie. Right, Todd?”

Todd actually laughed. “I knew what she meant, Kate.”

“Still, she shouldn’t say things like that.”

“You’re right, Katie. I shouldn’t be saying them. You should be!” Jill said with a giggle. “You really need to learn to tease your man.”

I sighed, loud enough I’m sure Todd and Jill heard me. “That’s not me.” It wasn’t really a claim, so much as an admission that I didn’t know how to be any other way. I’m not seductive or playful. I’m serious, all-business, me. That’s the me Todd first met, so why try to change?

“Katie, the first trick is to get yourself in the right mood. Are you laying down on your bed?”

“Yeah,” I said with some hesitation. “And it is lying down. Not laying.”

“Whatever. You’re not doing it. If I open your bedroom door, I’ll find you sitting on the edge, ready to put the phone back in its stand. Recline. Put your head on a pillow and enjoy the sound of Todd’s voice. Imagine a bit.”

For some inexplicable reason, I did as Jill suggested.

“Now, I’m going to my room and I’m going to teach you how to do this right!”

Our rooms are on the same side of our small living, dining, everything room. The two-room apartment is pretty small, with one shared bathroom off the short hallway. I heard Jill’s bed creak as she flopped onto it. Part of me was still seething, part of me was stunned, and a whole lot of me was too damn curious.

“Is she really going to — ?” Todd asked.

“Yes, I am,” Jill gleefully responded. “You’re going to have phone sex, Todd. Real, wild, phone sex!”

“No, he isn’t,” I said.

“Bullshit, Katie. We’re going to have phone sex,” Jill proclaimed. “Todd, are you still thinking about getting kissed when you arrive?” Jill asked.

“Uh, well — ”

“Of course you are,” Jill continued. “You’re a guy and you love the idea of a tongue teasing yours. Good phone sex is all about great ideas, even if you’d rarely be so wild in real life. Well, in your cases, maybe never that wild.”

“This is sort of weird. We shouldn’t do this,” I said, trying half-heatedly to stop what seemed so likely to happen by now.

“Katie, you need this. And I’m sure Todd does.”

“Need what?” Todd asked.

“Okay,” Jill continued, ignoring both Todd and me, “I’m Katie. Just listen and don’t try to analyze everything. Let yourselves fantasize about each other.”

I leaned back on the bed and momentarily thought about Jill in the other room. Was she shaking her head at us? Was she laughing at us? Or was she thinking about Todd?

“Todd, you enter the apartment and I, Katie, close the door. I push you against the wall and kiss you. I push my pelvis against you, so I can rub my body against yours. My tongue teases yours while we kiss. And you kiss me back, passionately, with your arms tightly around me.”

“Sure. Yeah.” Todd sounded distant. He wasn’t having any trouble with his imagination.

“I’d slowly move to kissing your neck, while my hands undid your belt and unzipped your pants. I’d kiss you so passionately that the electricity would make you cock beg to be set free.”

I could hear Todd’s breathing change. We had never had phone sex, but it was clearly something he was enjoying. I noticed my hand was no longer clenched and my neck wasn’t quite so tight, but I wasn’t relaxed or okay with things, either.

“I’d drop to my knees and reach into your tighty-whities, pulling out your cock so I could tease it with a kiss.” Jill paused to listen to Todd. And then, without Todd realizing it, or me for brief moment, she shifted the perspective of her narrative. Damn, she is good at talking to men. “And another kiss. And your lover licks the head of your cock with the tip of her tongue. She’s teasing you.”

There was something about her voice. Jill was speaking in a soothing rhythmic manner. It was seductive. I want to be able to talk like that.

“She lifts your cock and licks that nice little spot where the seam is. You know the spot.” Jill paused. “Are you alone, Todd?” she asked.

“Yeah,” he answered. I knew he was alone, and so did Jill. Todd has a little studio apartment near the university. Then it dawned on me where she was going. I thought about speaking up yet again, protesting, but I really, really wanted to hear him.

“So take out your cock for Katie,” Jill instructed him. “Take it out so you can stroke it.”

“I… uh… it… ,” Todd stuttered.

“What?” I exclaimed?

“I didn’t mean to — ”

“It’s okay, Todd. Tell Katie what you’re doing.” Jill knew how to use pauses to tease Todd. It was an art form, the way she coaxed him. “It’s okay. Are you playing with it?”

“Yes. I’m holding my penis and can feel the blood pulsing through it.”

“It’s a cock, Todd. Or a dick. Or whatever you want to call it, but not a penis. Tell Katie what you’re thinking and doing describe it to us.”

“My hand is around my dick and I can feel it throbbing. It almost hurts, it’s so hard. The idea of… well, you know, someone doing that….”

“Now, think about Katie. You’re in the doorway and your lover is kissing it and licking it. A little sucking, too. But not too much. You don’t get to cum that quickly,” Jill continued. “She stands up and kisses you again. You finally realize, she’s wearing a nightshirt and nothing else.”

Me? Wearing nothing but a nightshirt? I couldn’t imagine doing that. Not even in my own apartment. And Jill knew that. I’m not her.

“You’ve done that,” Todd vacantly said.

“Yes, I have. Nice of you to notice,” Jill giggled. “Think of Katie wearing no bra, no panties, nothing. Just a nightshirt,” Jill cooed. “Katie, lose those sweat shorts you wear around the house.” Jill tapped on the wall between our rooms. “Right now. I’m taking my shorts off so I can enjoy this more. I’m going to be rubbing my clit while Todd gets off.”

Todd was breathing deeper, more intensely, but not faster. He was masturbating as he thought about both of us at the other end of the conversation. I was so shocked by Jill’s bluntness that I couldn’t think clearly.

“Katie? Those shorts off?”

“Yes,” I answered, and they were. And so were my panties.

“Todd, think about Katie, leading you to her room, your cock still hard and exposed. She’s going to push you down onto her bed and climb on top of you. Would you like that?”

“Oh, yes. Yes, I would.”

“Katie, imagine Todd, lying there on the bed. You pull down his pants and his underwear. Still in your nightshirt, you climb onto him. You position his cock and slide down, guiding it deep inside of your wet, tingling pussy.”

Todd and Jill were both breathing in synch. My roommate and my boyfriend, about to cum together over the phone.

“Can you hear Katie’s gasping, deep breaths, Todd?”

“Uh-huh.”

“She’s touching herself. She’s imagining that big, throbbing cock of yours inside her while she plays with her pussy. Don’t you wish you could see what she’s doing? She’s enjoying this!”

I was enjoying it. It was exciting and disturbing at the same time. Jill was talking to us about having sex. I shouldn’t have been enjoying it so much.

“So tell her what you’d be doing for Katie.”

Todd was doing quite a bit, from the sounds of it. He had to slow down and focus to tell us his version of the fantasy.

“I’d lift that nightshirt over her head, toss it aside, and kiss her breasts.”

“Kiss her breasts? That’s the best you can do?”

“No, Todd, don’t kiss my breasts and gently like you do. It’s not that great,” I blurted out. “I want you to suck my tits. Passionately go after my nipples, taking them into your mouth and really, really suck them,” I told him.

“Hell, yeah!” Jill concurred. “Go after Katie. Devour her. Consume her.”

“You’d be okay with that?” Todd asked. “I try to be gentle and romantic.”

“Sometimes, I want you to just rip my clothes off and fuck me. Suck my tits. Ram your dick into me. Have some passion.”

“God, that’s fantastic,” Jill said between moans. “Please, Todd, please fuck Katie this weekend. I want to hear that bed bounce and shake. Shove that throbbing cock of yours into her pussy.”

“Oh, no, I’m getting on top of him and I’m riding that dick. If he finally wants to show some passion, he’ll have to earn that chance.”

I was running my hand through my soft pubic hair, teasing my clit, and sometimes inserting a finger into myself. My pussy was dripping, begging for Todd’s dick. I tensed, tightening my pussy while fingering myself. And then I thought of being on my back, Todd pumping hard. I hoped he would really take me this weekend, really fuck me like Jill had said.

“Todd?” Jill softly whispered. “Keep stroking that cock of yours. Tell me about her tits.”

“I’ve always loved Kate’s breasts. So soft. Her beautiful light skin makes her nipples seem so brilliantly pink.”

“And you’re going to suck them for her.”

“Yes. I am. While she’s sitting on my lap, facing me, I’m going to suck her tits.”

“And I’m going to slide up and down that dick of yours, while you suck my tits,” I reminded Todd.

“Oh, crap! Oh, man. Oh…” Todd lost control. He gasped and groaned. He was cumming like I’ve never seen or heard him cum before.

“Katie, tell him what you’re doing,” Jill begged.

As I teased my clit, using the wonderfully slick juices from my own pussy, I told Todd I was touching myself. I didn’t know what else to say, but that was enough.

“I love you, Kate!” Todd managed to say.

I came instantly, with a wave of passion, my body convulsing. “I love you, too.”

There was silence as we all enjoyed the moment. Of course, Jill broke the silence.

“That’s how you say goodbye, kids. Damn that was fun.”

“I’ll see you Friday night,” Todd whispered.

“I’ll be wearing a nightshirt,” I promised.

We ended the phone call, but I kept thinking about the call for another ten minutes or so. Without so much as a knock on my bedroom door, Jill entered. She was wearing only a t-shirt, her pussy was completely visible. She walked over to my bed and sat on the corner. I realized my pussy was exposed, too. I sat up and tried to be nonchalant, but I felt quite vulnerable.

“I’m pretty sure Freddie’s home this weekend. You’ll have the apartment to yourself. Use it.” She then flopped down next to me, giggling. “Damn, that was fun.”

Jill pulled me down next to her. We were there on the bed, side by side, staring at the ceiling. She started to play with herself, right there next to me, without the slightest inhibition.

I wasn’t angry anymore, but I wasn’t sure how to feel, either. I nudged Jill. “What are you doing?”

“Masturbating. Again.”

“You can do that?” I asked.

“You can’t?”

“I don’t think so. I’ve never been able to have two orgasms in a night. I’m just not wired that way, I guess.”

Jill turned her head towards me. I could feel her breath against my ear. She whispered as she spoke.

“On Friday, you’re going to fuck Todd. You’re going to throw him down on this bed, climb on his cock, and fuck him until you have two, maybe three, wild orgasms. You’re going to be so turned on that you cum with a burst. I bet it’s the first time you squirt!”

I reached down, and did what Jill was doing. She wasn’t just touching herself, she was thrusting a finger deep within herself. And more. I sat up to watch, to study. Jill smiled at me and kept on pleasing herself. She was using her palm as her middle finger explored her body.

“What are you doing?” I asked again, but this time my meaning was curiosity. “Tell me.”

“I’m feeling the ridges inside and pushing my palm against my clitoris. Right at those ridges, that’s the beloved g-spot. Put your head back on the pillow, look up, and find the g-spot.”

I did as she suggested. There were the ridges and an intensity I hadn’t felt before that moment. Something weird was going on.

“I think I need to pee!”

“No, no. Go with it. Think about Todd, think about whatever you love. Keep touching yourself. Enjoy the feeling.”

“But what if — ?”

“Enjoy it, Katie. Keep touching exploring yourself.” Her voice was soothing, but I was worried I might pee all over myself. But I didn’t.

Yes, I came again. It was messy and thrilling. With Jill right there beside me, coaching me on how to lose total control.

When Friday arrived, I came home from work to find a thin white cotton nightshirt on my bed, with the words “Wild Thing” emblazoned across the chest.

Learning to Trust Others

Kate looked at me, searching for approval or something.

“Sounds like you have a great roommate.”

“You don’t think we did anything wrong?”

I shook my head.

“What if Todd was thinking about her while he… took care of things?”

“He probably did. That would be normal, Kate.”

“Didn’t she cross a line?” Kate wanted some sort of recrimination, on the surface, but I sensed she really needed to be told what she had enjoyed was okay.

Why do we look for reasons to feel guilty? Do we think men do the same? Not in my experience. I’m sure Todd wasn’t wondering anything other than when he might get laid again.

I explained to her that Todd hadn’t cheated and Jill seemed to be a good friend. Todd clearly didn’t lie or go behind Kate’s back. Sure, Todd might think about Jill from time to time, but Jill had guided him to think about Kate. That was the right thing to do, and done pretty damn well.

Kate needed to accept that our friends and lovers all think about other people. Fantasy is part of most healthy relationships. Learning to use that fantasy and lose the guilt isn’t easy for some women, but we need to embrace human nature.

You have to learn to trust yourself, your partner, and your friends.

I Can Dance!,"I don’t make music.

I can write and take pictures (I can bitch slap shade throwers) … I can mix sounds and voices and instruments live. I find comfort and meaning and rhythm in words, and can lyricize random poetix with ease.

Oh, I can compose things …

And musically speaking, I can even plink and tinkle a little.

Plink and Tinkle

I know what sounds right, I’m not tone deaf and I know what’s ‘in key’ (though I’ll never be there!). I’m not an aggregator of esoteric crap on an i-pod … There is nothing more curious, or annoying, to me, than knowing that for some reason, you’ve collected more than 5,000 songs (are there even 5,000 songs??), with a healthy dose of Inuit, bagpipe or “chakra music” in your song library.

Now I can appreciate some sexy throat singing every now and then … Get down to a little Achy Breaky Mani Padme Hum on a Friday before last call. But to walk around with that shit in my earbuds for any stretch of time is beyond my capacity … and yours too, if you’re going to be honest! You don’t need to be streaming it — and I certainly don’t need you showing me that you’re hip enough to ‘get’ or “like” it.

Anyway … I’m not a musician.

I’m musical, and music has informed my life … but a creator of music (or a designer of sound), is something I’m not. I also can’t draw, but that’s a whole other post.

So whenever I find time to hang out on SoundCloud, I’m generally wondering why I’m there. Why would I, not being a musician or creator of “sounds”, sign up there?

Why would most people? then, becomes the question.

Whenever I bang around on SoundCloud, I’m praying it won’t algorithmically single me out … like, “Jeff Glovsky plays Barry Manilow on SoundCloud” … That would be mortifying.

Because that’s all I do there — that’s all I CAN do — is listen to (“play”) music, and then repost (“share”) it. I suppose I could put a couple playlists together … and those would be, like, my “sounds”, right? Isn’t that how it works?

Or maybe I’ll record myself reading my writing — the ultimate self-absorption … a maximum masturbation session!

“Amsterdam Avenue, holy midnight”, I’ll intone enigmatically … my deep yet keening voice, preening dramatically.

“…on my knees…like Romeo! Verona, in my pantaloons! Elizabethan trappings, Al Pacino in delivery…Like, “Attica, oh Attica! Oh, wherefore art thou…ATTICA!?

“I’m screaming. No one hears me.

“But now give it out how I’m a writer…Writing! No more shitty gigs…No odd job mental patient lot, no theater, theayter…NOT! I’m never gonna work again!”

Yeah, I could read that. My overwrought and written words pouring out inconceivably: me reading and recording them! See, reading a prose piece or poetry live, at an open mic. — or better, by invitation — is one thing. But taking the time to record and promote something … that’s not what I do.

… Yet. Like working up the nerve to dance … ‘cause that’s also something I don’t really do. I might bop to the beat like a tactile transducer, or stamp my foot up and down like a farmer … or maybe even twerk a little.

But I don’t dance, and I don’t write or play music.

I can only share my own sounds.",https://medium.com/mix-tape/i-can-dance-2e6200bccc8,['Jeff Glovsky'],2015-02-25 02:22:21.751000+00:00,"['Music', 'Jeff Glovsky', 'SoundCloud']"
Drone Photography,"If you have ever watched those heart-in-your-stomach action movie sequences featuring a guy leaping off a steep cliff and into a moving airplane, you would have experienced the wonderful cinematography that can be achieved by using aerial drone photography.

Follow @dronesdaily on Instagram for the best aerial footage — featuring a drone video or picture every day.

After just over a year of posting daily aerial pictures and videos, we celebrated hitting the 10K follower mark on our Drones Daily Instagram page last week. We wanted to take a moment to reflect on the last year, which has been a fun experiment in learning what types of aerial photography work best on Instagram (we’ll write a bit more about this in detail in a future post), as well as exploring all the creative methods people are using drones to capture content from very unique perspectives.

Recently, technological developments have made drones available to the mainstream and many drones are used in everyday activities such as spraying crops, covering the news, navigating neighborhoods and recording criminal activities, saving lives by delivering medical supplies in emergency situations and of course, aerial photography.

Drone photography is becoming increasingly popular due to the ability of drones to capture great quality, high resolution images in areas that are inaccessible or difficult to reach such as cliff tops, the middle of the ocean or even deep, dark caves.

Some low flying by @tommyiff

Aerial photography is not for the fainthearted but if you are willing to invest the time to learn the best practices, you will reap the rewards in terms of amazing photographs and videos that you will enjoy for years to come.

Here’s our essential tips to help you get started on making great aerial photographs with your drone:

Invest in essential props: Props like the gimbal allow you to mount the camera and set it in any direction you wish thus allowing you to capture shots in multiple angles. Location, location, location! Heavily wooded areas with many birds and low buildings mean that you will not be able to capture good quality images due to interference and blockage. As much as possible, try and select areas that are free from these elements in order to get the best pictures. Pay attention to the weather: Clear, sunny days without too much wind and light are essential for capturing good images. It goes without saying that you should avoid taking photographs in cloudy, rainy and snowy weather unless it is your intention to capture these extreme conditions. Mild weather protects your drone from water and snow damage.

Aerial photography is a great way to capture the wonders of nature, the beauty of human settlements and myriad other interesting subjects from different vantage points. After you’ve got the best out of your drone and camera the next wonderful element is sharing your images with friends and fellow enthusiasts. If you’re an aerial photographer and want to join our ambassador network, we want to hear from you! Just click here to get in touch.

How To Benefit From Google’s Mobilegeddon,"Back in April, Google announced “Mobilegeddon,” a new ranking algorithm that boosts mobile-friendly pages in Google’s mobile search results. Naturally, there were some sites that benefited from the update, while others failed to adjust quickly enough.

Here are a few things that we’ve learned from this update and what improvements you can make to be on the winning side of Mobilegeddon:

Only Mobile Is Affected

This new algorithm did not affect Google search results for desktop or tablet users, that doesn’t mean that mobile-friendliness isn’t important. While computers and tablets are widely used across the globe, more than half of all Google searches are made through mobile. SEO in 2015 has been increasingly focused on mobile — and local SEO — and will likely continue that way for the forseeable future. After all, it’s all about relevance and being in the front of those ready to take an action!

Lightning Load Time Is A Must

Your audience expects instant gratification, especially millennials. Google wants to serve their users with the most user-friendly pages at the top of search results. Whether it’s an image, video or text on your site, do what you can to reduce page load time.

Touch Navigation Position is Key

When it comes to your website’s navigation icons, it is important to position them in an upper corner of your site. This makes the mobile user’s life easier when they are searching for a specific item, or page, on your site.

Google will never stop updating its algorithm; The best thing a business can do is ensure that it’s site is a well constructed with a responsive web design, so it can please the fast-growing segment of mobile media consumers.",https://medium.com/liqui-site-tech-news/how-to-benefit-from-google-s-mobilegeddon-7e69327d09e8,[],2015-10-26 15:55:36.713000+00:00,"['SEO', 'Google', 'Mobile Friendly']"
A Story Each Day,"May 10th, 2014

A Story Each Day

“Fireworks?” My roommate asked, headed for the window that led to the fire escape, and up onto the roof.

“Either that or an alien invasion.” I answered, annoyed to be further distracted from my work, and hoping for the latter. I’d wondered where the loud thundering noise was coming from — I’d never heard fireworks in Brooklyn or New York City, but my curiosity wasn’t strong enough to pull me away from my computer.

“I’ll bite.” My roommate said. His almost naïve enthusiasm was hardly ever diminished, despite the fact that it was growing late and he’d been busy all day. He pushed open the window and leaned out onto the fire escape, and into the drizzling weather.

I sat at my laptop, wondering what the hell to type next. I bounced back to facebook, which only led me to feel more distant, like the sound of those fireworks, or the alien invasion.

It’d been a while since I’d seen fireworks — The fourth of July was the last time I’d seen them, I guessed, since I had a rather reclusive New Year’s Eve. And I’d never seen an alien invasion. So if I did decide to step out onto the fire escape, climb onto the roof, and see whatever was making that booming noise, it’d probably be worth it.

I stepped out of the window and saw my roommate climbing back down the fire escape from the roof.

“Fireworks over the Statue of Liberty.” he announced, with his never-fading enthusiasm. “A great view of them from the roof.”

“You can see them?” I asked, just to make sure my time was going to be well spent, since it wasn’t an alien invasion, after all.

“Yes. It’s a great view.”

“Hm. I’ll take a look.”

“Just be careful. The stairs are quite wet. And technically, we’re not supposed to be up there.”

“Great,” I thought. “I’ll be sure to try to avoid the rooftop patrol.” I would have let my sarcasm bleed out loud, but it was a little too late in the evening for such sour words, and the air was a little too fresh to poison it with such a sardonic response. I took his advice and carefully climbed up the thin metal steps to the roof.

The rainy mist amplified the glow of Manhattan and cast a beautiful tint over the skyline. My eyes warped and tried to adjust from an afternoon of staring at the computer. I waddled across the roof, thinking of all the apartment dwellers below me who were probably wondering what in the world somebody was doing on the roof at this time of night.

I walked to the west side of the building, wondering if the low thundering sounds had drawn anyone else up to the roof. They had. A couple stood at the edge of the roof, arms around each other, hoodies shielding their hair from the light rain, smoking a cigarette.

I wandered past them, to the furthest westward overlook. Behind me I heard them muttering.

“…scared the hell out of me!”

I turned back, a little sheepish for ruining their nice moment in the drizzling rain watching fireworks, but not ashamed in the least.

“Sorry.” I smiled.

“It’s okay.” They said.

I wandered further away, so as not to bother them, but it gave me a little bit of comfort to know that I wasn’t alone in my appreciation of the golden sparks that dotted the sky over Lady Liberty.

“I should contemplate my life up here.” I thought. “This seems like a good place to reflect on what in the world I’m doing with myself.” It did seem like a good place to do that, but instead, I just blinked several times and tried to get my eyes to adjust fully to the glowing skyline. No reflective thoughts visited to my mind. No glowing revelations about purpose or meaning or my direction in life.

Just the drizzle of rain, and fireworks and the Statue of Liberty.

The fireworks stopped, and I started to realize that it was getting cold and I was barefoot. I turned back, glancing over at the couple, still finishing their cigarette. As I walked away, one of those reflective thoughts I’d expected decided to drop by, though I didn’t give it much attention.

“How many people get to do this?” I thought to myself. “You’re on the roof, watching fireworks over the Statue of Liberty. This feels special. It can’t be though, it’s so simple and it’s not even for you. You’re miles from it, and anyone can see this. Anyone can go out onto their roof and watch this and think it’s for them.”

But most people don’t. It’s not special. It wasn’t made for me.

But somehow, it was.

It’s not the kind of thing you can share. You just stand there, in the rain, and watch the fireworks until they’re done. And then you leave.

I stepped back in to the apartment, my wet feet splotching on the kitchen tile.

“How was it?” my roommate asked, cheerily, as if I’d just been to a world premiere Broadway show.

“Mmm” I lied, “Just fireworks.”",https://medium.com/a-story-each-day/fireworks-ecdc714d76d1,['A Story Each Day'],2015-05-10 15:27:46.964000+00:00,"['Fiction', 'A Story Each Day', 'Short Story']"
Honey Daiquiri,"Oh Dear Sweet Honey, how I love thee. I think to myself as I text away with TJ.

Ah TJ. My anime watching, basketball loving, Marvel following guy I’m texting. That’s it. I realise that I’m being impatient but come on. TJ and I have been texting almost every day the past week — which please appreciate, is a miracle for me, as I genuinely despise being on my phone unless of course I’m messaging Honey — if she ever looks at her phone, or Bugsy — if you count forced computerised one worded responses you see under ‘T-Mobile — Saved Texts’ — but still! A week, and every day…almost, and aside from the odd flirtatious comment in the form of a competitive jest every once and a while, TJ has made no further advancement in the progression of our relationship in order to find out who I actually am. Like e.g. asking me on a date.

‘So just ask him.’

‘Que?’ Honey asks from the kitchen as Bugsy plays his new karate ninja app game thing on his phone and I sit on the carpet by the T.V looking down at mine and TJ’s entire relationship in all its emoticon glory.

‘If it’s a problem, she should just ask him.’ Bugsy says with a semi-uninterested shrug.

‘Bugs, there is no way in hell I’m asking TJ out on a date.’

‘I never said that.’

‘You literally just did.’

‘No, I said ‘just ask him’ and stopped talking, I never said ask him on a date.’ I roll my eyes. Unbelievable.

‘You should just say to him you guys haven’t gone out yet or spoken in person since you spoke for three seconds at basketball.’ Honey says moving things around in the kitchen as there’s a crash. ‘Sunnova! Whit.’ She growls.

‘Everything ok in there sis?’

‘Uh-huh. Just Whit trying to test my reflexes by piling up every dish we own in a giant unstable mound by the sink, no biggie.’ Bugsy and I share a smirk as Frap, Honey’s cat, stalks out of the darkness nervously and I pull her onto my lap, stroking her. She’s always so loving. I think to myself as she throws her head into me purring loudly while I scratch behind her cute little kitty ears.

‘So what should I say Honey?’

‘That as much as you enjoy communicating via electronic waves and phone couriers it would be nice to, ya know, not.’ I type out the message, then instantly stop.

‘Wait. Instant dilemma.’

‘What?’

‘Well what if he suggests going out? I hate going out?’

‘See? Impossible to please.’ Bugsy says I assume to Honey and I suddenly feel like I’m out of the loop and have missed something.

‘Do not use Daiquiri as an example, she’s barely female.’

‘Hey!’

‘As for not wanting to go out, just invite him to the house then hermit, that way at least he gets to hang out and talk to dad as something other than just Coach.’ I pause.

‘You’re a genius.’ I finish typing out the message and press send. ‘Thank you Honey!’

‘You’re welcome Daks, be sure to text me as soon as you realise…’

‘Huh?’

‘Nada.’

‘You’ll be there right Bugs?’

‘Well, I haven’t intimidated anyone in a while…?’ I turn to my non-biological brother — but brother nonetheless in disbelief.

‘I don’t know how they do it, I mean you look so human, so lifelike and yet are such a robot.’ He looks up from his phone for the first time to glare at me the way only a cyborg with the urge to kill can…

As I flutter my eyes cutely and his eyes darken.

‘If I were a Grimm I would cut your head off.’

‘Oh Grimm, oh Nick — stop brain hacking me!’ He sticks out his tongue as Honey pokes her head around the corner confused.

‘What are you guys talking about?’

‘That new show Grimm, Daiquiri’s added David Giuntoli to her ‘white guy elevator list’ — I tried to tell her that was racist.’

‘Oh Grimm, is that any good?’

‘So far it’s aiite — but Nick.’

‘Nick?’

‘Nick, aka main guy in Grimm that I wish I wasn’t so attracted to ’cause he sorta reminds me a lot of Whit — he is so fine — Grimm guy! Not Whit — I mean yes Whit but also…sigh. You get it right? Yeah you get it.-’

‘You have two lists?’

‘You don’t understand, he’s so friggin hot — again, sorry he looks like your husband.’ She shakes her head stepping out of the kitchen, with a light coat of flour covering her arms while she wipes her hands on her apron, noticing Frap.

‘Hey! Do not show my cat love!’ Frap darts off my lap, scurrying into the shadows as I turn to Honey in shock.

‘Do I need to call RSPCA?’

‘Do not show her love — she knows why — I thought I could trust you.’ I laugh. ‘And more importantly? What did you say most awkward person ever?’ I pat off Frap’s remaining fur, opening up the message on my phone.

‘I said, ‘so hey, as much as I enjoy yours, mine and T-Mobile’s relationship, I was wondering if you wanted to come over mine sometime? Maybe. If you can. If you want?’…See that was smooth…right?’ Bugsy and Honey turn to each other slowly shaking their heads as I look between them both, lacking in praise.

‘There’s just…’

‘There’s no hope.’ They say as I instantly and nervously deflate.",https://medium.com/honey-daiquiri/honey-daiquiri-ee1cbdcda3fb,['Miniq Brown'],2015-10-17 13:21:13.485000+00:00,"['Short Story', 'Comedy', 'Life']"

How to Complete the Qur’ān in 7 Days,"How to Complete the Qur’ān in 7 Days

Ahmad and Abu Dawud narrated from Aws b. Hudhayfa, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: ‘We came to the Messenger of Allah, prayers and peace be upon him, as part of the delegation of Thaqif.’

He said: ‘The Messenger of Allah, prayers and peace be upon him, would come to us every night after ‘isha and speak to us.’

He said: ‘One night he was late from (coming to see us at) the time he would come to us.’

We said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, you have come to us late tonight.’

He said: ‘I had my portion of the Qur’an to read and I did not want to come until I had finished it.’

Aws said: ‘I asked the companions of the Messsenger of Allah, prayers and peace be upon him, about how he divided up his reading of the Qur’an.’

They said: ‘Three, five, seven, nine, eleven, thirteen and the Mufassal.’

Thus, the Prophet, prayers and peace be upon him, would complete the Qur’an weekly. His reading would be as follows:

Day 1: Fatiha to Al-‘Imran (three suras)

Day 2: Al-Nisa to Al-Anfal (five suras)

Day 3: Al-Tawba to Al-Hijr (seven suras)

Day 4: Al-Nahl to Al-Nur (nine suras)

Day 5: Al-Furqan to Al-Fatir (eleven suras)

Day 6: Ya Sin to Al-Fath (thirteen suras)

Day 7: Al-Hujurat to Al-Nas (Mufassal)

So, here’s a suggestion for those able to read the Qur’an fluently. With one week (or two) left to Ramadan, who is up for following a Prophetic sunnah. Who is up for the challenge of finishing the Qur’an in a week as the Messenger of Allah, prayers and peace be upon him, would do regularly and then who will continue that and do four readings of the Qur’an in Ramadan? Who is up for it?

"Medium for nonprofits, explained","By now you’ve heard of Medium. Maybe you read how Melinda Gates stays impatiently optimistic, met the bad-ass scientists who also happen to be women, or couldn’t resist a click on “7 things I did to reboot my life.”

You may have even created an account after seeing another nonprofit’s story on Twitter. And when dipping in from an email digest, maybe you noticed the big-format, window-like photos and surprisingly high-quality writing that seems to be the norm. Me, I’ll never forget how a practical and compelling story convinced me to write my representatives about gun control for the first time.

I’ve been using Medium personally and I’m blown away by the inspiring ideas that are shared each day — in stark contrast to the no-brain share-drivel that occupies our feeds. I’ve also helped my nonprofit clients use Medium effectively over the last couple years, so I wanted to share some guidance if you’re thinking about jumping in. Because I believe that now, more than ever, is the right moment to get started.

[Note: If you’re very new to Medium, this explainer from the team at Buffer is a must-read.]

Let’s get this out of the way first: Why should my nonprofit join *another* social network?

I get it. Google+ still hurts. And, it takes precious staff capacity and internal political capital to convince an organization to expand its online footprint. You should never launch into a new presence without careful consideration.

So, let me ask a few questions about the way you currently create and post content for your nonprofit:

Is your nonprofit’s blog easy to find on your website? Are the posts you work so hard to create getting the level of attention you want? What’s the reading experience like? Is the text the right size? Does it look great on mobile? Are the photographs you’ve collected from your programs given space they deserve? Do you have in-depth analytics for your content, like what percentage of visitors actually read the full piece? Will your biggest supporters get a mobile push notification when you add a post?

Money,"Please be aware that this story contains harsh language.

A consistent ray of light poured into his bedroom, and he slowly rolled awake. He liked the idea of waking to sunlight pouring through his windows, like a responsible millionaire entrepreneur. But he hated being awakened by light. There was nothing responsible, or even healthy, he felt, about waking up that way. And besides: the sun only started to shine into his room at 11am, which was far too late to claim that he was disciplined.

True, he could have easily moved his bedroom to another room in his house. There were dozens and dozens of rooms in his house. He didn’t like to think about that, though. When he’d bought the house, it had seemed like a good idea. What else was he going to do with all of his money? Buying this monstrosity of a mansion seemed like a good way to start to spend his infinitely bloated bank account. But when he moved into the house, he had absolutely no earthly idea of what the hell to do with all of those rooms.

So, of course, he did the obvious thing: He bought an absurd amount of exorbitantly priced furniture and filled his rooms to the brim with gaudy décor and stylish design trends that he got out of the latest overpriced design magazines. He bought and bought, until his rooms were almost as full as his bank account.

The sun had already started to creep across his bedroom, and he pulled himself out of the silk sheets. He stood and walked to the spacious, satin-tile bathroom. He looked in the mirror. He shrugged.

He walked down the long, elaborate hallway, and passed each room, one by one. He glanced inside, and tried to imagine each of them full of people. Excited, social people. Not those boring fucks who nod and smile.

His gold-plated iPhone rang, and he hurried to pick it up, wondering who the hell it might be.

“Hello?” he muffled, out of breath, but excited to receive the call.

“Hello, is this Mr. Davenport?” an almost robotic voice recited.

“Uh. Who is this?”

“I’m calling from the National Secure Investment Foundation, and we’re — ”

Davenport stopped paying attention. He should have known. Why didn’t he know by now? Telemarketers swamp toward money, like flies to raw meat.

He put the phone down and let the telemarketer keep talking.

He thought about how the hell he could actually fill all of those rooms with people. Social people. People excited about life. People excited to be there.

He knew a few ways.

He shaved, dressed, and then called one of his friends.

“I’m having an event,” he said. “Invite everyone. Yes, everyone.”

The Southern California heat drifted and approached willfully, meandering, as if it had nowhere else to be. The day of the party approached, and Davenport hired an army of decorators and caterers, craftsmen and entertainers. They bustled and swarmed in and out of his mansion. Davenport stayed in his room, and tried to figure out what in the world to wear. Finally, as the guests started to arrive, he put on the exact same thing he’d worn the day before and walked downstairs into the foyer of his looming mansion.

Movie stars, pop stars, politicians, rappers. Celebrities who were famous for being famous, celebrities who were famous for being infamous, and celebrities whom nobody actually knew why the hell they were famous in the first place. His mansion dripped and flooded with fame, almost as intensely as the money in his bank account.

His rooms finally filled with people. He looked around, and a feeling of warm fulfillment grew in his chest. He wandered into one of the rooms and smiled at a woman. She had subtle, Cleopatra eyes — nearly venomous, but enticing nevertheless.

“Great party, huh?” he said, trying to sound cheerful.

“Yeah,” she muttered.

“What do you think of the place?” he asked.

Maybe that was too forward. Hm.

Maybe he shouldn’t have asked her what she thought. Maybe —

“Crazy. Fucking insane,” she said. He smiled. “Whoever owns this place is a psycho.”

His smiled fled so fast that his face forgot that he’d ever even had one.

“Uh. Yeah. Ha. Fucking crazy, right?”

She smiled at him uncomfortably, with the hint of a cringe at the corners of her expression. His eyes glanced around.

Everyone was excited and social and energized, except for him. So he reached into his subconscious, grabbed a scoop of social enthusiasm and force-fed it to his brain.

“Ha. Yeah! Whoever owns this place is a psycho! Like Norman Bates psycho. Or Patrick Bateman. Man. Absolutely F-ing crazy.”

The Cleopatra girl just looked at him and gave him another almost-smile.

“I gotta — I’m gonna get another drink.”

And she left.

The party ended, as most do. Davenport sat down in the middle of the expansive atrium. Confetti and crumbs dotted the vast, marble floor. He lay on the cold floor, and fell asleep.

He awoke — not to the sunlight, but to the violent ring of his gold plated iPhone. He answered, groggily.

“Hello, is this Mr. Davenport?” the familiar recitation began.

Davenport shut his eyes. He grimaced.

“I’m calling from the National Secure Investment Foundation, and we’re interested in talking with you about a valuable investment opportunity that — ”

Davenport let his mind wander and the poor telemarketer’s words blurred into the bright, Southern California sunshine. His thoughts waded through the night. Past Cleopatra, past his grossly over-designed furniture and the army of caterers. The telemarketer’s voice rambled on and on until —

“What’s the name of your company?” Davenport asked.

“I’m with the National Secure Investment Found — ”

“No, no. The telemarketing company. What’s the name of it?”

“I’m with the National Secure — ”

“Stop lying. What’s the name of it?”

The telemarketer finally relented, and revealed the name of the tacky telecommunications company: Call Tone Telecommunications, Inc. Davenport cringed.

“What’s your name?” Davenport asked.

“I… I’m with — ”

“No, I don’t want to know who you’re with. I want to know your name.”

There was a long silence.

“Michael.”

“Michael what?”

“Michael… um… Sanders.”

“Well, Michael. When I buy the company that you work for, would you like to work for me instead?”

Davenport bought Call Tone Telecommunications, Inc., and changed the name of the company immediately. He hired a score of new marketers, and fired a score more. He wrote a new, comprehensive guidebook for every employee on the phone. New discussion tactics, new conversation strategies, new call schedules and operating methods. On the first day of the company, he arranged the entire workforce to meet in the main office room. All two hundred and eleven employees gathered around. Michael stepped to Davenport’s side and tried to snag him before Davenport addressed the crowd.

“Uh, excuse me, Mr. Davenport, sir. I — ”

“Not now, Sanders, we’ve got to get things rolling, right?”

“Uh, yes sir. But I…well, I had a question about the call manual.”

“Why?”

“Well, the question that you want us to ask… it doesn’t — ”

Davenport turned to the crowd and pressed the microphone to his chin.

“Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you all for being here this morning. We’re about to start something amazing, and I can’t wait to begin that journey with you.”

Michael recoiled as Davenport’s voice echoed across the cubicles.

“Telemarketing is about asking the right question. And there’s only one question we’ll be asking anyone.”

Davenport picked up a phone on a desk and opened an operating manual. He dialed one of the numbers. The crowd of employees waited and watched, anxiously. The phone rang over the speakers, so everyone could hear. Finally, someone picked up.

“Hello?”

“Hello, is this Mrs. Hutchins?” Davenport asked.

“Yes, who is this?”

“I’m with a new organization, called the Davenport Foundation, that is focused on your local needs and community enhancement. Would you be able to answer one question for me?”

“Well, okay.”

Davenport smiled.

Accessible Interface Design,"The Frustrating Cycle…

Inspiration can be difficult in a pass / fail world

As a designer working on products that need to meet WCAG Accessibility standards, I’ve found myself stuck in a somewhat frustrating cycle. It goes like this…

Once I’ve gotten a clear understanding of the problem that I’m solving for, and after I’ve validated the design goals and use cases with the appropriate stakeholders, I start to turn bullet points and lists into visuals and interfaces that people can connect and interact with. In this process, I apply color and detail to my work. I’m not just aiming to simplify; I’m also trying to inject beauty into the given screens to try and bring fun and delight to the people who will use the product. In this process, I start with rough grayscale wireframes and then slowly ratchet up the fidelity of each component and screen.

In fleshing out the visuals for these components and screens, I try lots of different background colors, typefaces, font sizes, and weights and ultimately, I pick colors that look good to me.

I then socialize my higher fidelity designs with other designers, product managers, researchers, customers, etc. and something bad happens. I start to fall in love with the chosen colors. I know I’m not supposed to, but it happens. I’m human.

Then as development begins on the given product and we start to hammer out the finer details, the topic of accessibility and color contrast ratios comes up. D’oh!

If only I had checked all the colors at the beginning of my explorations, before my color crush turned to love.

So now I go to one of the many color contrast ratio calculators available and check if the colors chosen will work with the given background colors / font sizes / font weights.

Invariably something fails. And this is where the frustrating cycle begins.",https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/accessible-interface-design-d80e95cbb2c1,['Adrian Rapp'],2015-12-18 18:26:34.736000+00:00,"['Design Thinking', 'Design', 'Accessibility']"

Managing the legal risks of UGC: Key issues to consider,"A new report outlines some of the key legal issues faced by publishers of user-generated content. Damian Radcliffe dives in and identifies some high-profile risks that no digital journalist can afford to ignore.

BBC online appeal for UGC

User-generated content (UGC) is an established part of 21st Century journalism, with contributions ranging from the submission of photographs and comments through to the hosting of regular columnists and guest bloggers.

As research by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism has recently shown, many established news organisations struggle to understand how to credit these types of contributions. Publishers like Forbes and the Huffington Post have come under heavy fire in some quarters for building their digital brands off the back of high-volume and frequently unpaid user submissions.

Nonetheless, UGC is clearly here to stay. New technologies make it ever easy for citizens to contribute content in the form of pictures, videos or full articles to mainstream media outlets.

In May, CNN announced that citizen journalists can now interact with its newsroom direct via a Google Glass app. Meanwhile smartphones such as Nokia’s Lumia 1020 — which offers a 41MP camera sensor, full HD video and stereo audio recording — increasingly blur the lines between material shot by a member of the public and professional production.

With both established players and smaller local publishers embracing UGC as part of their content mix, a new white paper written by the journalist David Banks, and published by n0tice in an effort to leverage wider usage of their UGC platform, offers a useful recap of the laws that UK publishers need to consider.

The Banks report is easy to read and, although I would like to have seen more examples of these legal principles and challenges in action, the 19-page paper is a handy primer for anyone with an interest in UK media law.

I’d recommend reading the full guide, but if you don’t have time here are some lessons worth highlighting and remembering, whether you’re new to UGC or an old hand:

1. Defamation

In the social media age, this is probably the element of media law with the highest profile. It’s a complex area, but a couple of aspects are particularly worth noting.

The first is the ‘repetition rule’ whereby “anyone who repeats a libel has a liability for it”.

As the report notes: “A claimant can theoretically sue the entire chain of people who spread libellous material,” and, as the author states, “they have been known to do so.”

One of the best known examples of this in recent years relates to the retweeting of false allegations against Lord McAlpine. This resulted in high-profile damages being paid to the Tory peer by Sally Bercow and comedian Alan Davies — following tweets on the subject (the BBC has a handy guide to Twitter and the law).

Alongside this, there was an Ofcom investigation into the broadcasting of the allegations. It saw both the BBC and ITV being censured by the regulator, with the two organisations also paying damages to the peer.

The lesson here is that publishers cannot simply share online (whether on their website or over a social channel) material which others are distributing.

For users, the same checks and balances need to apply to this content as if you had originated it in the first place.

2. Third-party comments

Most websites now feature space for reader comments. The sheer volume of contributions across these sites means that pre-moderating (reviewing them before publication) is unviable. However, this means that publishers may be inadvertently hosting user comments which are potentially untrue and libellous.

Fortunately, in this space the “online publishers defence” means that you are not liable for these comments unless the contribution was pre-moderated prior to publication. This defence — coupled with the volume of user contributions most sites now receive — is probably a key reason why most news sites are now post-moderated.

In the event of any defamatory material being placed on a website, the guide notes that, provided “you take down the defamatory material once you are notified of its presence, you avoid liability for it”.

These kinds of issues can affect publishers large and small. Judith Townend’s Meeja Law website has highlighted challenges faced by the Isle of Wight-based website OnTheWight. Non-news sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor have had to contend with issues arising from bad reviews.

But it’s worth noting that you cannot be sued for defamatory material which has been on your site for more than a year, as complainants cannot sue after a period of 12 months from the original online publication date.

Read more about these topics by downloading the white paper by completing this form.

In a second post, I’ll look at another big issue that requires careful handling in relation to UGC: the question of copyright.

On Creativity And Why I love Typeform,"I fully believe every person has some creative talent. Some people never really pay attention to it, which is kind of sad. Some people acknowledge it but rarely use it to create something. And then there are people who are doers: they know where their talents lie and know what other skills they might need to get the most out of their skills and interests, in order to create something awesome. This is why I love following sites like Product Hunt and Betalist, where I can find new products, apps and services every single day. Some of them will never leave the beta stage, dying as they started: an experiment. Does it matter, though? In my eyes, no. Whatever you do, you learn something while doing it. Showing it to the world makes you very vulnerable because then other people are able to see it, criticise it and say their opinion without knowing what you went through while creating the product. But there is the other side, too. The side that makes all worth it: some products become loved. They are used by dozens, hundreds, thousands or maybe millions of people, who love it and find it helpful. What you created helped someone. Someone, somewhere, saw what you did and found an answer to a problem they had. Creating this kind of connection with someone is one of my biggest goals in life.

It’s fitting that I mentioned Product Hunt as I was introduced to Typeform by them. I answered one of their user surveys that were created with Typeform. Even though I had answered a lot of surveys over the years (I kind of like them), I had never seen an approach like they had: there were no endless rows and columns of small checkboxes or radio buttons you had to scroll back and forth when using mobile or a small screen. No plain white background, no clumsy interfaces. The form was super fast, very beautiful and answering felt like a conversation. Allowing me to truly focus on one question at a time made me more engaged with the survey. (A feeling which, I would assume, provides better responses from people.)

Typeform did something differently. It had a totally different approach to forms. Answering them would be an awesome experience and creating them an inspiring process, with only imagination as a limitation. I still smile a little when I open a survey which is created via Typeform because a) more and more people seem to find it and b) I hope more people can use it to channel their creativity to all interaction with their customers/users/readers/friends/students, etc. If you just look at the examples and demos of different kinds of Typeforms, I’m sure you’ll find a few that make you think “that’s awesome”.

I always love it when people take advantage of their imagination and use technology to unleash it. Typeform does this, for example, by allowing you to create “choose your own adventure” forms. But not everyone knows that much about technology or coding (and not everyone cares to learn, either). Which is why I love how accessible Typeform is to both the responders of the surveys and the creators of the forms. You don’t need any coding skills to create an awesome form that makes you stand out from the crowd. This being said, if you want to play with their API, you totally can.

Nothing makes me more sad than seeing people or products that have a lot of potential (or were big once) but, at some point, stop going forward. Do you know the type? One day they decide to stay put. Not going forward, not following the world around them, not adapting to the changes. This, despite their obvious ability to do so, should they decide to. Constant development and drive to go forward, provide new solutions and will to learn new things are what drive me forward and is the thing I want to see around me. Typeform is a good example of a product that does exactly that: the core features stay the same but there is always the will to do better. (Fortunately, this is no way an unique feature! For example, my other all-time-favorite product, Trello, does the same.)

There are many ways of doing things. Creating a survey with a platform like Typeform, showing people who fill out the form that things can indeed be done totally differently from what they usually see, is very refreshing, empowering and inspiring. I believe this is the case with all creative work. Your creation is unique from everything else. It shows your way of doing, feeling and thinking about things. It might offer someone a new point of view: something they have not thought about — or maybe they did, but abandoned it, thinking it’s not possible. Every creative piece of work, no matter how small, can make a difference if it’s shown in the world. As John F. Kennedy said:",https://medium.com/endless-forms-most-beautiful/on-creativity-and-why-i-love-typeform-b07ef7cca883,[],2015-12-16 17:20:35.991000+00:00,"['Typeform', 'Startup', 'Creativity']"
"O — (#2) I tried, didn’t I?. The masked man then turned a dreadful…","Out of nowhere, a helicopter is heading to our place. It flied recklessly before it finally made a smooth landing on a far spot of the building. It is, tho, causes a raging wind that worsen the cold.

The helicopter had no passenger, only the pilot. It was a skinny guy in a thick dark coat walking in no rush to them. His movement was very light as if he was dancing along with the wind. As he got closer, I realized he was wearing a fox mask.

“Well, look at you, Blanco. The operation broke down and here you are handling the least important work there were.” Said the masked man when he got to us. His voice was surprisingly cheerful. “You should’ve let this loyal servant of yours handle this.” he then give a lil disrespecting nod to the gigantic man.

Blanco didn’t reply, he looked back to the masked man without any intention of saying anything.

“Well, Apparently a young man was planning a suicide bomb on the same day and the same place as our operation, ha! How convenient! We lost a lot of man today. My master was not at all happy. You know how important that operation was” the masked man said the last sentence slowly with enhancement as to show how important it was.

“I heard. Do you think it was Ghost’s?”

“I dunno, what I know, tho, the young man pulled a fucking badass suicide!” the mask man then throw one of his hand to the air, “He was holding a samurai and held it up in the air with one hand, and a trigger on the other. He screamed a japanese swears, God knows what he was saying, then sliced the samurai straight into his heart right after he pushed the bomb trigger! Then, BOOM!” He then jumped glorified right after re-acting the young man suicied act. “I guess he prefered death by a sword than a bomb.”

“How would you know that?”

“Oh yea, well, I was there. I manage to, you know, slip away.”

“I heard there weren’t any survivor?”

He didn’t answer. It was silence after that question.

The masked man then walk straight into me. He then lean forward, watching like a fox ready to snatch a chicken. Well, he is wearing a fox mask and I do feel like a helpless little chicken. He was so close to me that I could feel his warm breath on my chest skin. His presence was cold and intimidative. I could’ve sworn that I could sense a smile behind that mask.

“Now, you… are you just a distraction from the real show? or are you not. Who are you to… ghost?” the masked man said slowly. I was not sure was it a statement or a question. Either way, I had no answer for him anyway. “Ghost, the man who knows everything.” he continue with whisper as if he was talking to himself.

The man who knows everything? that got to be him. Ghost.

“I don’t know anything about him. I swear” I had to make it clear. I have to make sure they understand that I only saw him, once, at the cafe.

For a moment there, nobody move or say anything. The only sound was the whistling sound of the wind.

“Such a poor soul. Trapped on this unearthly affair between the evils. What does an ordinary young soul like you had to do with all this.”

“Let me go, then.” I said, hopelessly.

I then tried to stabilize my breath to lessen the trembling of my body. Yes, my body was trembling, big time.

“Uhh, look at you. Cold? I admire how you are holding up so well. No screaming like any other victims usually do. It got me thinking, Are you really just an ordinary boy?” said the mask man before executing a long laugh.

Of course I am! I got a gigabytes folder of porns if that what you mean by ordinary boy! I thought, but, of course I have no guts to say that out loud. Especially when my life was on threat.

After a moment, we were back in silence again.

In a split of second, out of nowhere, the masked man stab a small knife into my left thigh. It was so quick that no one realized the masked man had moved until it happened, including me. The masked man didn’t stop, he pushed the knife deeper straight into my bone. Strangely, There’s an electrical buzz once the knife touched my bone. I screamed like a howling wolf in pain. My screams echos to the night air then disappears like it never existed. Finally, even my mind shut the hell up.

“Tell him, I’m coming.” the masked man then said this with a whisper on my ear. He didn’t want both Blanco or the gigantic man heard.",https://medium.com/o-the-shadow-puppets/o-2-i-tried-didn-t-i-1ecdde11e484,['Habibie Arief'],2015-05-03 11:03:48.875000+00:00,"['Fantasy', 'Novel', 'Fiction']"
Takeaways from the Enterprise UX 2015 Conference,"Let’s face it: enterprise software historically has not successfully integrated meaning, emotion, and identity into UX designs. As an industry, we have a lot of work to catch up to the best of our consumer counterparts. At Salesforce, we complement traditional user testing with rapid ethnography to increase our understanding of our users’ worlds. However, it’s easy to get caught up in the what when sharing our designs with stakeholders. As a response to these presentations, Mary and our research team have focused more on the emotional side of our users when preparing for trips, debriefing stakeholders, and sharing data with other team members.

Crafting design systems

Enterprise UX was a fantastic opportunity to see how other teams are tackling the challenges of creating and scaling design systems.

David Cronin, Executive Design Director at GE, discussed the evolution and craft behind GE’s Industrial Internet Design System, a comprehensive tool for aligning visual language, interactions patterns, and technology across numerous products, teams, and users. GE, maker of everything from aircraft engines to microwaves, has in many ways become a software company as complex as any in the world.

Likewise, Phil Gilbert, General Manager at IBM Design, described the massive design effort underway at IBM. They are building a team of 1,500 designers — including many college recruits — in studios across the globe, with an IBM Design Language to support them. This gorgeous resource is the shared vocabulary for a design organization at unprecedented scale.

Here at Salesforce, we have a growing Design Systems team that is busy crafting a design system not just for our own products and teams, but for the vibrant ecosystem of partners and customers that build on our platform. Through our Salesforce1 Style Guide, we’ve found that many external developers, administrators, and users are looking to our UX team for design guidance and direction. We’re working hard on tools like the style guide to support consistency and quality across our services.

Fostering cross-functional collaboration

Another common theme was the importance of cross-functional collaboration to success in enterprise software development. We heard this constantly from presenters at companies like Citrix, Paypal, GE, and IBM, as well as from fellow attendees on the floor and in the official conference Slack.

The so-called “Three-in-a-Box” model, describing the required partnership across Design, Product Management, and Engineering in particular, certainly reflects our experience here at Salesforce. We’ve found that bringing product teams into our process early on is extremely rewarding in the long run. We include product owners and engineers in brainstorming and sketching sessions. We invite them to watch (and ask questions) during user research. Early cross-functional involvement means that everyone, not just UX, has a hand in our designs.

After the conference, we’re inspired to take this collaboration further. We want our designers and researchers to work closely with product managers to learn about the business side of our products. We should work even more with engineers to better understand Lightning and our overall development architecture. We’ll keep bringing PMs, developers, and quality engineers to our customer site visits. We’ll also continue to encourage our design team to gain Salesforce certification and get a true look at the experience of our administrators.

Designing for experimentation

How might enterprises embrace the fail fast, fail often mantra? Lean methodology needs an organization willing to adapt and learn. Bill Scott, VP of Business Engineering at Paypal, emphasized the value of designing for “throwaway-ability” and being open to constant change. In large organizations, it is easy to fall into the trap of building for delivery versus innovation.

To reinvent their checkout experience, Paypal formed lean UX/engineering teams to rapidly prototype and test new ideas. These teams stressed the importance of constant learning. Scott also presented Netflix as an example of a company that embraces experimentation by focusing on the customer and strategically carving a path to build-measure-learn, from the structure of their teams to their choice in programming languages. Netflix uses its UI as an experimentation layer. Scott ended his presentation with an open question:",https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/takeaways-from-the-enterprise-ux-2015-conference-c7d70dbd03f4,['Arthur Che'],2015-12-18 18:23:58.084000+00:00,"['Events', 'Enterprise', 'Conference']"
Chaplain Bruce Fowlkes,"I remember the excitement I had when I was first hired. I received a phone call from President Arnold about the job. I remember coming on campus for the first time, in the dead of winter, and driving on the campus and then all of a sudden being on the end of Burgess at the T there and saying, “That’s it.” I remember just being utterly charmed by the place. I had been wanting to get back into campus ministry, and this seemed to be the perfect kind of job for me. I could be a chaplain all the time, and in a small town much like the town my parents live in in Sheridan, Arkansas. So it felt like home and my people.

Some of my richest memories, the most vivid memories since I have been here have been trips with students. One of the first ones we went to was to the Good Samaritan Ministries in South Texas, and taking a group of students down there. We flew from Houston and drove a rented a van from here. We spent a week working for both Good Samaritan and also across the border in Mexico. So the students were doing their work and in that area for the first time in their lives. We’re talking about Colonias and communities that are right along the border and the kind of realities they were in. The students experienced shopping in a really nice mall in Mexico and then driving into the kind of poverty that I’ve never experienced before and then talking with the students about it. That was a rich experience and also the joy of being with them and living with them for a week and watching their eyes and their awareness that comes from getting out of your comfort zone and being in a new place.

So we went there and also to Yakima, Washington, to the Yakima Nation, and spent a week there at the log church for the Yakima Mission. I remember vividly the end of that week. We had purchased food for the week and had made our own meals and such, and we had all this left over food.

And Kathy Whitson — Doc Whitson — wanted to talk to me about something so we went outside. All the students were cleaning up the kitchen and trying to figure out what to do. We started to have a conversation about how we live in a world of so much — so much plenty — and we were working in a community with so much need, not just members of the Yakima Nation but others in that area. It’s a farming community, so you have a lot of migrant workers and so they are living hand to mouth. And just as we started that conversation, a man was walking down the road on the other side of the fence, down by the driveway, and he raised his hand and yelled “Hello!” It was out in the country and seeing someone walking along the road gets your attention. And he asked over the fence, “Do you have any food?”

And I paused because it was kind of amazing that it happened at that very moment when we were discussing that topic. And I said, “Yes, Come on in.” So I went and opened the gate. He went downstairs and was telling us a little about himself. He was walking from his home to town to catch the bus, and he just needed a little food. So we just made some sandwiches for him and stuffed his pockets with apples and bananas so he would have enough to take with him. Then he asked us if we wanted to pray. So we all stood around in a circle, Doc Whitson, the students, and I. Since I am a chaplain, I am expected to say the prayer, but I didn’t even get the words out of my mouth before he started praying. And so he prayed for us and not himself. He actually prayed for us. That was the end of the week. It was a wonderful way of wrapping up, making all the stories come together, like pulling all the loose ends together. So we talked about a lot of different ways people live and survive, how they live through the difficult times of poverty, culture clashes, colonialism, and the local concepts of mission.

So those kinds of moments were remarkable.

We went to Costa Rica for spring break. It was a similar thing in that we experienced a different culture, and it was one culture sitting right next to the other. — the well-off culture sitting right next to the impoverished neighborhoods. We could easily see that contrast. You can see that kind of contrast in America, too. But many of our students do not come from that stark reality. So while we were in Costa Rica we worked for a congregation that built a handicapped accessible bathroom. The government had mandated that all churches had to have a handicapped accessible bathroom. So this was a poor congregation that didn’t have the money to build such a bathroom. We built a stand-alone accessible bathroom. That was an eye-opening experience because that country has different construction methods. We had to understand how that worked. We did manual labor and mixed cement using big piles of sand that were dumped on the front porch of the church. We mixed cement by hand. We dug the hole for the sceptic system, which is what it basically was — a hole in the ground. We covered it over. Ernie Potter was with us, and he was the hardest working person the whole week. He was just an amazing man. He saw by the end of the week that we couldn’t finish the project. He wanted it done, so he talked to the leadership of the church to find out what was needed to get the project completed. They told him all of the stuff that needed to be secured, and he started writing it down. And he said, “Let’s go ahead.” He went to some of the leaders of the church and they purchased everything that was needed to finish the project because as a congregation they were living on the edge and didn’t know where their next bit of money would come from. It was important to finish the job. Ernie saved the day for those people.

The mission trips, I believe, were started by Terry Ewing. He would take groups of students on mission trips during spring break. Since then the trips have become a tradition. Students have expectations and get excited about where are we going to go and questions of that nature. Students get involved in the planning of the trip because it is their project. I am the advisor of the event, but I get students who research the location, make the budget, write the grants, and appeal to funders.

Students volunteer for these projects. They have to raise their own money. We try to make it very affordable for them. We receive support from a lot of local churches — Eureka Christian Church and a church in Litchfield have been very generous. Other churches in the area have been generous. Week of Compassion, the Disciples relief organization, has also given us grants. We have several different pieces of funding that come from various places.",https://medium.com/studs-terkel-project/chaplain-bruce-fowlkes-572c0fed3578,['Eureka College Alumni'],2015-09-24 15:24:10.348000+00:00,"['Christianity', 'Travel']"

Where the. How Glenn Beck Could Help Europe But…,"Since May 2014 there is a downfall trend in support for Russia. As Putin’s aggression escalates, things become clear. Sooner or later the only people to support Russia in Germany will be either Russians or ideological fascists and communists with no interest in the facts. It is likely that pro-Russian politicians won’t be taken seriously and will be forced to hide their real views.

So why are alternative media and PEGIDA leadership so detached from the people on the Russian issue? Actually it makes sense if we assume that the influence over the center-right constituency in Germany was seized by a pro-Russian fascist movement called the New Right (not to be confused with American New Right).

For instance, Jürgen Elsässer from Leipzig, who believes that CIA is behind ISIS − the editor in chief of a conspiracy news magazine “Compact” and a frequent guest on “Russia Today”. Or Götz Kubitschek, one of the leaders of Leipzig PEGIDA (the second-largest branch), is also the founder of a New Right think-tank “Institut für Staatspolitik” and a New Right magazine Sezession.

Götz Kubitschek accuses the left of believing in something he believes himself. PEGIDA Dresden, February. 9, 2015

Notice, that when Elsässer and Kubitschek speak at PEGIDA rallies, they hide their real views as much as they can and instead convey quite a liberal rhetoric, to which they unconditionally oppose. The only explanation is that they consider PEGIDA protestors in East Germany unready for their ideas. Political scientist W. Gessenharter notes that “political mimicry” is a common practice for German New Right. By posing as moderates they want to convert the population softly and gradually. That feature actually parallels an integral part of the whole New Right movement, an equivalent of Frankfurt School for fascism:

“[Their] doctrine is based on the concept that a revolution can only be successful if based on the cultural domination over a given society by implanting certain ideological messages through newspapers, conferences, and higher education”. (Shekhovtsov)

What are the New Right ideas? Actually, it’s a disaster that nobody talks about them. These are not your typical “Golden Dawn” thugs with flare torches. Simply put, New Right stands for intellectual fascist traditionalism. The movement was started by French philosopher Alain de Benois in 1968. It has spread through Europe with minor peculiarities: for instance, while the broad New Right movement is neo-pagan and anti-Christian, in Germany it’s not always the case. The New Right rejects economic science and largely rejects politics itself. Like all fascists, they oppose modernity (progress, individualism, equality, capitalism, pluralism), they expect the ongoing “age of decadence” to end with a rebirth: a “new man” will arise and build a new totalitarian Europe, return to the hierarchical, elitist, homogenous, “rooted” and “traditional” values of ethnic communities of the premodern past.

The New Right want to end the Peace of Westphalia, abolish the nation states and replace them with “Europe of a hundred flags” − a federation of tribes, “where the political units [..] should be established in accordance with cultural, historical, and ethnic identifications rather than simple administrative division”. That’s their key concept called “ethnopluralism” − basically, Germany is for Germans, Catalonia − for Catalans. New Right followers can say that they only oppose “unbridled” immigration as much as they want, but that’s a lie. They inherently oppose the very idea of cosmopolitanism because it represents modernity and blood-mixing, of which they want none. Not because of racism, to which they oppose, but because all ethnic groups are equal and each of them should exist separately and according to its own medieval traditions. That’s some real flat-earth society for you.

According to Alexander Dugin, who represents the Russian branch, the New Right is “unambiguously” pro-Russian and anti-American, its members stand in solidarity with anti-American Islam, primarily with Iran. The main ideologists of “National Front”, “Austrian Freedom Party” and “Northern League” also adhere to the New Right camp. Dugin adds, that the New Right account for about half of all European “far-right”. The other half are Nazis with flare torches.

Some PEGIDA leaders are reportedly tied with “Generation Identitaire”, an influential New Right youth movement, that has recently spread across Europe using a good branding and marketing strategy.

Again, this is not something people know about. Mainstream media just makes things worse when they label the New Right as Nazis. When people don’t hear typical Nazi rhetoric from the podium at PEGIDA rallies, they disregard the media’s claims and lose vigilance. It’s very unlikely that even PEGIDA founder Lutz Bachmann knows what New Right ideas are about: he’s a just a useful idiot. There are several conclusions to be made here.

The goals declared by PEGIDA are not extremist and an overwhelming majority of PEGIDA supporters associate with liberal values. There is a great ideological divide between the majority of PEGIDA supporters and the majority of PEGIDA leaders. PEGIDA leadership in large part consists of people from well-established intellectual neo-fascist circles − they saw the opportunity and seized the momentum to advance the New Right agenda and stealthily promote ideas of collectivism, anti-liberalism, anti-capitalism, anti-Americanism, racial hygiene and conspiracism. To appeal to the public these leaders are forced to use liberal arguments to such extent that some left-wing commentators accuse PEGIDA of neoliberalism (leftist term for unbridled capitalism, the rule of 1%).

A classical liberal view of PEGIDA must combine opposition to its leadership with support for demonstrators and the original position paper that brought them into the streets. Even if we don’t agree with PEGIDA on everything, we should remember that anti-communist “Solidarity” was a trade union and its members were hardly Ayn Rand fans, yet they’ve made Poland freer. Similar thing with Ukraine last year. What matters is this: are the protestors for more freedom or less freedom? Are they fighting for the right thing?

In today’s Germany there is no politics in the normal sense, there is no dialog about ideas, principles or vision. Politicians pose as pragmatists, nobody believes in anything. PEGIDA started a discussion on a seditious issue that concerns 73% of population − half the country supports the movement, yet the government slanders them all as Nazis. That can wake many people up, get them involved and curious. The discussion that started in the streets and online can trigger a much broader debate and bring about changes that lie far outside immigration issue and sharia courts issue. Thus begins the battle for the minds, for shaping the narrative.

Today the New Right are in a better position since they got hold of a great platform. Yet for protesters it isn’t about who’s preaching from the stage: the preachers will only say as much as the people will allow them to. Rather it’s about the cause, ideas, values and vision, which is a good thing because ideas can compete and evolve. In six months PEGIDA may not even exist, but the people who supported the movement will remain involved to some extent, political life will be more active than it was a year ago.

If the New Right’s strategy proves effective, we’ll have fascism in Europe, Glenn Beck will be proven right. Though, as stated in the previous chapter, until people have the prophetic power, the best strategy is still just to do what’s right and moral. On the contrary, if the New Right’s strategy proves ineffective, it’s possible classical liberals will have on their hands the biggest opportunity since 1870's to turn the politics in Europe upside down and push towards individual liberty and laissez-faire capitalism.

The failure of European socialism is imminent, the whole fiat money bubble may burst within this decade; many believe the Old Media is doomed; arguably the whole higher education system will shrink significantly; the technology will repeatedly prove state-provided services ineffective and unnecessary; the proliferation of 3D-printed handguns may raise the question of self-defense rights.

There can be a Tea Party in Europe because the people are good, all they need is a good alternative, a good proposal, a good vision − they don’t want New Right’s medieval fascism. In Britain the issue of the EU and open borders led to an exploding rise of classical liberal UKIP. In the Netherlands the issue of islamization brought noticeable success for classical liberal “Party For Freedom” (PVV).

In order to make sure that the above-mentioned changes work in favor of constructive forces and not some deranged fascists, Germany (and Europe for that matter) needs more political competition in the opposition today: more voices, more media outlets, more groups that will investigate and expose each other, making the political scene more transparent, providing the public with better choices − or just any choice.

The most feasible danger of the New Right is that they can hamper the discussion from taking the proper direction, that’s why they must be exposed for who they really are. But until it is done from a credible right-wing (meaning classical liberal) perspective, until it’s done in a fact-based way − it is impossible to do. The left-wing media can’t do it because they are imbecile, nobody trusts them, and they can only yell “racism” − which exposes nonе of the real contents and dangers of New Right ideology.

There already seems to be some alternative to the New Right, it just doesn’t have a strong voice yet. The Munich branch of PEGIDA is now led by Michael Stürzenberger from largely unknown “Die Freiheit”, the only political party in Germany that looks like it’s consistent and truly rooted in individual liberty. With 500 members “Die Freiheit” is a copycat from Geert Wilders’ PVV, and Stürzenberger has confronted New Right intellectuals over their destructive views.

More people like this should follow, but actually the future of Europe depends not just on Europeans, but on all people over the world who know the right answers and the right ways to deliver them. That’s us − conservatives, classical liberals, libertarians, economists, artists, bloggers, commentators.

In the Soviet Union with total censorship there was only one way to get more or less consistent and intellectually sterling explanation of things − foreign shortwave radio. It was called “listening to the voices”. “Radio Liberty”, “Voice of America” and BBC broadcasted real news and commentary and played western Rock music. Listening was sometimes dangerous and the signal was bad because from 1948 to 1988 the Soviets jammed these broadcasts with 1700 specially built noise generators, but the broadcasts gathered weekly audience of tens of millions anyway.

Today it is vital for Europeans to hear legitimate “voices”, especially American voices, that understand freedom and can share it − otherwise those who seek answers will fall into the trap of “Infowars”, “Russia Today” and other trashy sources and ideologies.

Unfortunately, most American conservatives today are largely detached from what goes on in Europe and such voices sound too quiet. The notable exceptions are American activists like Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller, who became very influential in Europe for addressing Europe’s problems and explaining them in rational liberal terms. They make things clear: it’s not about race, it’s not about “natives vs. foreigners”, it’s about freedom. Because of the American influence over counter-jihad movement many people in Europe become interested in learning things that are never discussed in Europe: the dichotomy of collectivism vs. individualism, the roots of “repressive tolerance” and leftist-Islamic alliance (Frankfurt School), the benefits of small government (if you’re really lucky). This is the basis for individualistic worldview, which makes one immune to fascism.

Even Glenn Beck could influence PEGIDA in a positive way because of his large following. However, in order to do that, he would have to become less obsessed with proving his past predictions and more focused on doing research and being consistent with his “strange bedfellows” strategy. Beck could support PEGIDA’s strive for more freedom, he could address the actual issues in the right way and warn Europeans about dangerous propaganda directed at them. Make a call to Spencer or Wilders, shoot a video − there are many ways to spread the message, that Beck and his team surely know of. By telling only a half of the story, by maligning the freedom movement in Europe as he did with Wilders and PEGIDA, Beck deprives Europeans of any solidarity and support from a big fraction of American conservatives. The solidarity that is necessary to bring people together, to establish mutual support and help both sides change the world for the better.

Still we can believe in the best: maybe Europeans will have a moment of revelation on their own, wake up and embrace a new vision based on liberty. Maybe they’ll save us all in the end.",https://medium.com/modern-magazine/where-the-wilders-things-are-ea847d2b9d8b,[],2015-03-04 17:05:38.405000+00:00,['Politics']
When Desperation Meets Opportunity Chapter 6 — A #NaNoWriMo 2015 Story,"Chapter 6 — Maggie

I kiss Brayden on the forehead and begin to read him “Green Eggs and Ham” to bring upon sleepiness. I’m not sure if he likes the book or not, but my mom doesn’t have a huge selection and I didn’t think ahead of time to bring any that I had. It doesn’t take long for Brayden to pass into his dreams. That’s always been something he’s been good at — falling asleep quickly! Just in case, I finish reading the book, quietly put it back on the bookshelf near his bed, and tiptoe out of the guest room. We haven’t had many sleepovers at my mom’s, but typically Brayden gets the guest room and I simply take the couch.

As I head into the living area just after 9pm, I notice my mom is still awake, reading a Food Network magazine. Not really my cup of tea. I’m more of a Cosmo person. The pure frivolousness of that publication helps me escape the reality of day to day life.

“How’d he go down?” she asks.

“Perfect, like usual. I have no idea how I got so lucky.”

“You certainly did. But, it must be genetics. Never had any issues putting you to bed.” She cracks a smile as that positive thought crosses her mind. I smile as I look out the picture window into the night. It doesn’t hold long, as I begin to think about what I need to do tonight. Why did Mr. Man pick this particular task for me? I’ll find out soon enough.

My mom sets down her magazine, and stands up. “I’m headed to bed Maggie. Whatever you are up to tonight, be safe. I’ll cover for you if Brayden wakes up and asks any questions. But you have to promise me something. Sometime soon, you have to tell me everything. I want to be there for you, but if you are going to just shut me out, then maybe we don’t have anything keeping us together.”

I stare at her, biting my lip, trying to determine the best response while subsequently attempting to quell my frustration with her. “First of all, we’ll always have Brayden. Regardless of how you feel about me, that is your grandson and you should be a part of his life. Secondly, I’m not shutting you out. I simply don’t know that much about what is going on yet. Mom — I promise you that if I can, I will tell you everything. You don’t think I know how hard it is going through life alone?”

Emotion overcomes me as tears flow down my face. The stress of everything occassionally overtakes me, and this is one of those times. I put my head into my arms and try to pull myself together. Unexpectedly, I feel the embrace of two arms wrapped around me. A hug, the first I’ve received in longer than I can remember. This moment could last forever and I wouldn’t hate it. Nothing compares to a hug from mom.

However, as soon as this spontaneous display of apparent affection appears, it is gone, and mom heads down the hallway to her bedroom.

Since I still have just under three hours until I need to be at the jail, I decided to take the risk of setting my phone alarm and getting some sleep. In the midst of the craziness of today, I somehow forgot that I am exhausted. Some sleep will do me good. Oversleeping would be bad, so I set three alarms just in case. You can never be too careful. Besides, I have no idea what I am dealing with or what would happen if I went back on our agreement. It probably isn’t too late to back out, after all, this is a test of whether or not I can be trusted. Then again, Mr. Man made it clear it would be very worth my while to do this. It has to be — I’m using pretty much everything I’ve got in savings to do this. To bail out someone who I’ve been assured is innocent.

— — -

My nerves prevented me from getting much sleep, but I must have dozed off at some point because my alarm startled me. I quickly shut it down, and rock myself back and forth to try and shake loss the grogginess. The jail is only about five minutes from here, so I’ve got some time. Even though I ate plenty for dinner, I decide to go make myself some toast and coffee to settle my queasy stomach.

Once I’m finished, I drop my dishes in the sink. Even though I’m literally going to the jail, I still manage to walk myself to the bathroom and apply some makeup and fuss with my hair. To an outside observer, this would seem pretty odd, I’m sure. But, in my defense, I feel a lady should always represent herself well, no matter where she is going.

The time has come. I put on my shoes, double check to make sure I have everything I need, and head out the door. Bail has not been something I’ve ever had to pay for before, but in doing some quick research, it looks like they won’t accept checks. Somewhere I’ll need to factor in some time to stop by an ATM and withdraw the $300 I need.

It is so quiet out. Not a single car on the streets. No wind to speak of. Stars shining brightly. Almost like the calm before the storm. I take my time driving, going as slow as I possibly can to delay the inevitable. Am I really doing this? Bailing out a stranger? Stranger things have happened, right?

Just a few blocks from the jail is a bank, so I pull in and drive up to the ATM. My brain freezes for a moment as I try and remember my PIN, but it comes to me and I get the money without issue. I probably shouldn’t have, but I can’t help looking at the receipt. Balance remaining: $200. That’s it. It hit me just how important doing these tasks has become. I’m barely afloat. More accurately, I’m drowning with nothing but a straw to get air. This money is important, and I sure hope the Man comes through for me.

After pulling back onto the main road, and driving a few hundred yards, I have finally reached my destination. The time is just about midnight, so driving at the speed of an 80 year old didn’t make me late. I park, and make the slow walk into the front office. This is a first for me — I’ve never once stepped foot in a police station or jail. My mom would probably be surprised to hear that. She must have assumed all sorts of things about me. Maybe one day she’ll get to hear how things really went down.

As I enter the station, the lights are almost blinding. My eyes, barely adjusted to the darkness, now scorched by the scintillating brightness of this place. Are they trying to fight the darkness of crime with their energy bill? Makes me wonder where more of our tax dollars go to…

A young man is at the front desk, of the jail. He is behind some glass with only a speaker to talk through. “Hello, what can I do for you tonight?”

I don’t know the person I am making bail for, so I sure hope he doesn’t ask any detailed questions. “I’m here to place bail for a man named Rodger.”

“Ahh Rodger. Thought nobody would come for him. He’s been here almost a week. His bail is only $300 — you’d think most family would cover that. Are you related to Rodger?”

I reply as quickly as possible — “Something like that.”

“Hmm. Alright then. I’ll need $300 cash. If he shows up for his court date next week, then you’ll get it back. We’ll send a check in the mail — it usually takes 4–6 weeks to arrive. My apologies — but I don’t get to write em. Just the way the system works.”

Well, if Mr. Man is true to his word, I shouldn’t have to wait that long for reimbursement. Regardless of the money, it still hasn’t made sense as to why this is the mission he sent me on to prove I’m willing to follow through with this tasks. Is it because it is something that most people wouldn’t do? Is it the simply act of spending a ton of money (for me, anyway) without any reasonable expectation of getting that back, for someone I don’t know? In any case, I’m here now. I open up my purse and dig for the money I withdrew from the ATM. $300 in just three bills. Seems like nothing. Could go up in flames easily, or simply blow away in the wind. Yet, to me, $300 is a month of food. My stomach lurches towards me throat as I hand the money to the officer. For an awkward few seconds, I hold on tightly, before loosening my grip and letting him have it.

“Now what?” I ask, visibly trembling. My focus was on paying the bail, but I hadn’t really thought about what happens after the fact. Does he leave with me? I can’t hardly just leave a man here if no one has even tried to see him in almost a week.

He answers, letting out a small yawn before forcibly swallowing it back down. “I imagine he’ll need a ride. Most people who post bail usually give them a ride, but you can take off, and we’ll help him get a cab where he needs to go.” Look at that — a way out. I could leave now, and ignore whatever else this night could’ve thrown at me. I could be back at my mom’s place, $300 lighter, but safe and within feet of my son. However, the stupid part of my in the back of my head is telling me that I have to stay. I have to see this through. It is part of the deal. Mr. Man didn’t say as much, but I can’t afford the chance that there isn’t something else I’m supposed to do to get what he is willing to pay me.

The officer has now disappeared into the bowels of the jail, so I find a metal chair to sit in. It certainly feels sturdy, so they must feel that chairs that won’t break easily are more important than comfortable ones in this particular waiting room. Maybe they should call it the empathy room instead.

After a few minutes, I hear the loud clanging of locks being undone, and the door to the right of the desk opens loudly. Out walks the officer, and beside him, nothing of what I expected. Here is a man who might break six feet on his tip toes. He is wearing a simple polo — nothing extravagant but certainly not shabby. His jeans are probably Old Navy, or something at the mall. They fit nicely. He looks a little dirty, but that is probably on account of the week in this concrete bunker. The girl in me can’t help but judge his facial features — he is a bit rounded, and probably has a few more pounds than he should, but he isn’t ugly, that is for sure.

The officer walks him over to me, and takes off Rodger’s hand-cuffs. “Alright. Here he is. His court date is next week Thursday. Rodger — make sure you are back here. This girl just paid your bail.” I’m nervous, but bring myself to look at Rodger during the exchange. He is looking back at me, but I can tell he is a bit nervous as his eyes dart back and forth around me, and to the ground. When the officer mentions I paid his bail, I notice a hint of surprise on Rodger’s face. What on earth was he in here for? Now I’m more curious than anything.

The officer turns his attention back to me. “If you need anything else, just let me know. If you stop by or call, just ask for Officer Dale.” We’ll find out soon Dale if I need to call you on that. He tips his cap, and walks back to his post. Now, it is just me, sitting, with Rodger, standing, just a few feet away. After waiting for at least a minute, I suppress a yawn of my own and decide that is my opportunity to speak.

“Hello Rodger. My name is Maggie. This is going to sound weird, but someone asked me to pay for your bail on his behalf. I don’t know him, and I’m sure I don’t know his real name. So, that is why I’m here, and not anybody else. I can drive you somewhere you need to go…” as I say those words, chills run down my spine. This guy was just in jail, and I want to take him in my car? Am I crazy? “…but I want to know more about you first. Why were you here?”

He walks over to a seat and sits down, with a chair between us. He looks at the floor and holds his hands together. He puts his head down on his hands, and for a moment I don’t think he is going to say anything. It almost looks like he is about to fall asleep. But, he picks his head up and, staring across the room, begins to speak.

His voice sounds tired, and a little higher than I’d have expected. “It wasn’t my fault. Just the wrong place at the wrong time. I was downtown last Saturday night with some friends, and we were enjoying some drinks at The Fat Cow. You know the place?” I nod. I’ve never been there. Brayden isn’t old enough to drink yet so I’ve decided to stay away from those types of places for the next 17 years. Yes, my life revolves around my son. So sue me.

“Well, it was closing time, and the owner was trying to get people out. My friend, Kevin, had way too much, like usual, and he was getting punchy. He yells at the owner ‘Hey Mikey, come on, we’re your best customers. Let us stay another hour!’ Mike, the owner, doesn’t really appreciate being told how to run his business, especially at closing time. After all, it is almost 2 in the morning. He just shakes his head and tries to stay cool. Then, Kevin jumps the bar and gets in Mike’s face, puts his arm around his shoulder, and pleads with him in the way only a severely drunk man can. Mike, pretty angry at this point, forcibly removes his arm and loudly tells Kevin he’ll call the cops if he doesn’t back down. Guess what happens next? Kevin starts to walk away, then rushes over to the draft spouts. He puts his head under the Miller, and flips the top and just starts drinking right from there. Mike rushes over, and pushes him away, then shuts off the spout. Kevin goes sprawling to the ground. Mike then calls the cops. Then, umm hey? Are you still there?” \

He notices that my eyes had shut, and I just about dozed off. It is an interesting story, but it has been a long day. “Oh, I’m sorry. I’m interested, really. Just been up a long time. Continue, please.”

“Okay, uhh, where was I? Oh yeah, so Kevin is trying to stumbling to his feet, and he keeps slipping on the beer that he got all over the floor. Mike has since called the cops and they would be arriving any minute. We ask Mike if we can help Kevin to his feet and take him outside. He nods, clearly beyond done with us. We pull ourselves over the bar, lift Kevin up and pull him over. Kevin lays on the bar a while and makes it difficult for us to pull him to the other side. I didn’t think much of this at the time. Finally we get him outside, and the cops arrive. I’m wearing a jacket, because it was pretty cold last weekend. The police ask MIke what happened so he told them. He also said he thinks Kevin stole so bottles, so the police search him. He doesn’t have anything on him. Mike mentions outloud that maybe we helped him, as Mike was clearly upset we didn’t do more to stop this from happened. The cops search my other friend, and he turns up with nothing. Just then, I check my coat pockets, and sure enough, Kevin had slipped two bottles of Spotted Cow in there. I swore up and down I didn’t take it, but Mike wasn’t having any of it, and we were all too drunk to really plead our cases well. Because my other two friends didn’t have any clear evidence of wrongdoing, they let Joe go, wrote up Kevin, and then took me to the precinct. I thought for sure the others would be back for me, but clearly I underestimated our friendship. I know they don’t make much. but you’d think they could afford $300 to bail me out between the two of them.”

Poor guy. He seems genuinely wronged here. I find it hard to believe he’s get put in jail over this, but consider the situation and how drunk everyone was, it is possible words got twisted. In any case, I do feel more relaxed about helping this guy out. I offer my support.

“I’m so sorry to hear that. What are you going to do about the court date next week?”

He looks up, and then back at me for the first time in a while. “They’ll get me a public defender, and we’ll do our best to settle this to a misdemeanor, so eventually it’ll be off my record. The only really chance I have of true innocence is Kevin and Mike both coming in here to say what really happened. Thankfully, this will be off my record after two years. I’m barely making ends meet working as a bank teller. After missing the last week of work, and for the reasons, I’m sure I won’t have a job to come back to.”

I understand the feeling. I understand what it is like to have your life turned upside down by one rough night. Yeah, maybe I shouldn’t have stayed over at my boyfriend’s house. But, I never said yes. I wish I could have fought back more. I wish I would have screamed. But I loved him, and thought maybe if I just let him, he’d calm down. Well, all I can say these years later is at least I have Brayden.

What should I say to Rodger? “Well, Rodger, how can I help? Do you need a place to stay? Some food? Is there somewhere I can drop you?

“Well, I have an apartment on the north side of town, probably 10 minutes from here. I’m really glad you came here tonight, so you don’t have to do that if you don’t want to. I’d understand.”

I reassure him. “You’ve been through a lot. I have so many more questions. Wait, hold on a second…” I get up and walk over to Officer Dale. “Can I have a pen and a piece of paper?”

“Sure” he says, handing me a post it note and a black sharpie. I scribble down my cell phone number, and hand Dale his pen back. I walk back over to where Rodger is sitting. “If you ever need anything, please call me. I’m not looking for anything, but it sounds like you could use a friend, and we could all use more of those.” I hand him the post it, and he takes it, smiling at me. I then motion towards the door, and he gets up and walks with me.

We don’t talk the rest of the way to his apartment. He does say a few words, but they are mostly “turn here” and “turn there” and “stop, this is my place”.

As he opens the door to get out, I decide to ask one more question. “Rodger, as I mentioned earlier, some random person asked me to bail you out tonight. Do you have any idea who would have known you were in jail and would have wanted you out?”

He sits, half out the door, then exits the car and leans back in hanging on to the side of the car. “Maggie, I really don’t know. I haven’t seen my parents in years, and the best friends I had completely screwed me over. Whoever it is, it’d be great if they could hep me on Thursday. Good night.” And with that, he shuts the door.

Just then my cell phone buzzes, and I get goosebumps. I look at my phone, and of course, it is Mr. Man. Weirdly, I was hoping something was wrong with Brayden. After an unexpectedly pleasant exchange with Rodger, now I’m facing the reality that this crazy guy is somehow watching me. How? Where is he? I look at the message:

Well done Maggie. That wasn’t easy what you did, but you handled it like a pro. Enjoy my thanks when you get back to your house. I’ll be in touch soon about your first task.

It is already past 1am. I should go back to my mom’s and sleep, but I’m curious to see what Mr. Man’s idea of thanks is. Driving 15 minutes out of my way when I’m already dead tired is a dangerous proposition, but curiosity keeps me awake.

I arrive and park the car. Then, I run inside the apartment building. Where would he have left something, and how could he get it to me that quickly? How many people are involved in this? My tired brain is struggling to grasp these really important questions, so I focus on my number one mission — what did he give me. I check the mail box first — empty. It must be upstairs. I walk up, stumbling slight. Upon unlocking my door I hear the sound of wood scraping on paper. There it is, an envelope.

I reach over, and open it up. Anticipation is welling up inside of me, but I”m careful to open the envelope along the top flap. I can hardly believe my eyes as I pull out the items inside. There is more money here than I’ve ever seen in my life. I stumble over to a table and begin counting. One hundred, two hundred, three hundred. All hundred dollar bills. I keep counting.

When I finish, I can hardly believe it. Am I just tired, or did I really just make ten thousand dollars for a couple of hours of inconvenience? How will I explain this to to Brayden? It is probably best for now that I hide this somewhere, and deposit it into the bank when I need to.

As badly as I want to curl up in my bed, I really must get back to my mother’s house. For a moment tonight, Brayden wasn’t my single focus. I don’t like that feeling, but I suspect this isn’t the last time that Mr. Man will get in the way of my son and I.",https://medium.com/when-desperation-meets-opportunity-a-nanowrimo/when-desperation-meets-opportunity-chapter-6-a-nanowrimo-2015-story-7cd2e4229334,['Josh Gauthier'],2015-11-07 05:22:44.669000+00:00,"['Traveling', 'Fiction', 'NaNoWriMo']"
"January, 2015","Journaling has been a habit since my one-digit years; a release through my adolescent years, and an expression through my maturing years. It is now a personal art form as well as a necessity. I knew I needed to write everyday when I chose to move across seas to Oxford. So much change would happen. So much uncertainty, and so many feels. I am naturally an analytical, observant, ponderous processor, I fascinate myself with my own reflections. These are some journal excerpts as I move to Oxford, England to work with Abilene Christian University as an assistant director for their study abroad program- the same program I did during my sophomore year of college. All I knew about my job was that I would be in charge of a weekly devotional and living with students. As I was song writing in Nashville before, I would continue to write in Oxford. This post simply shares experiences and reactions to my first month abroad: scene begins on my last day in America.

January 5, 2015, 5:47 PM Leather chair, Starbucks, Terminal A, Lambert Airport, St Louis, Missouri ‘Blowin’ in the Wind,’ Bob Dylan Sip. I have a hazelnut soy latte in hand, and I’m moving to Oxford. It’s a tradition to get Starbucks as I wait for my adventures. This joe seems extra good tonight. Sip. Last time I was here, it was upon my return from TX. It was my last goodbye to Abilene. It was my last goodbye to ACU and the people in it. It was my first professional piano gig. It was the first time I met Condoleezza Rice. Returning from Summit in TX. Sip. Before that, let’s not forget Tanzania. Before that, let’s not forget Zimbabwe. Sip. I’ve had a fist full of trips start and finish here. This airport sets the mood for my experience. For my feelings about going. For my thoughts about staying. For my dreams about living. For my hopes about flying. For my fears about returning. This airport. Change, change, change. Sip. But always the same terminal. The same Starbucks, on the left hand side. The same routine of waiting. The same routine of boarding. The same routine of landing in a new adventure. Landing on a new adventure. Sip. I finish my latte. Here we go.

January 7 [Oxford]

I’ve got many lists running about things I need, what to rearrange, what to do. Trying to take in the quiet empty house before it won’t be quiet for a long, long time. Trying to take in being here. Trying to take in that this is my job. Trying to take in being alone and on my own. Trying to take in what I will do for devotion.

I’m trying. What will 6 months do to me, Lord?

January 8

WENT OUT INTO THE WORLD OF OXFORD.

1) I was definitely alone. It was strange to remember all of this as I passed it, but not be with anyone. I had no one to share the simple act of walking with, new or old. I definitely enjoy this time of aloneness, of exploration in the city and in my mind. But it is an odd feeling, all the same. Yesteryears gone by.

2) I actually expected Oxfordians to be more sociable than they are. I had apparently forgotten. But people don’t make eye contact- which I constantly do to every single person I pass- and they don’t say hi or even smile. I miss that! I realized after living in Texas and Tennessee, it became natural and welcome. Not so welcome here. But I’ll do it anyway, as it suits my fancy.

I guess I bring it up because in general, it makes me feel less connected to the people, the city, the culture. I always plant myself in a culture and play out in my head if I could belong here or not. This more formal attitude is something I’m not really fond of.

January 9

I go from loving this empty house to hating it to loving it. I already think, “Hey I don’t have friends, I need friends.” But then I realize I’ve been here two days and I can’t just pop them out of nowhere.

January 14 [day before everyone arrives]

Taking in the house and environment before all the students arrive and it changes for good. It is about to come quickly and go quickly. I don’t think I’m prepared, but I don’t think there is a way to prepare for it.

January 16

Spent the rest of the night reading Daily Info, Oxford and planning my life away. Where has music been in my life these past couple of days!? No good.

January 19

David was the YWAM elder when I was here before. I went up to the altar to receive prayer four years ago. I found out I would be spending the summer in Zimbabwe, and I felt a pull on my heart for it, and for my future involving foreign missions. He prayed over me and spoke words into me. I remember that night, and writing down his words in my journal (“Get God’s word and write it on your heart.”). I needed that encouragement to have hope and find courage. It really did make a difference.

Anyway, here I was, four years later, standing in front of this same man and telling him what he did for me. He immediately remembered and said, “Well! You’re here and not in Africa,” asking what happened. I said in a whirlwind I went to Zim, to Tanzania the next summer, moved to Nashville, then for some reason came here. I didn’t know what was happening. Or why I wasn’t permanently in Africa. I said it was strange to be back and relive that. To wonder why I was indeed here, and if maybe I had done something wrong by not staying in Africa. I told him all I could do was be open. He told me he saw me as a door, an open door, and I let people pass through me. He said that as if it was a good thing, though I don’t know exactly what it means. “Being an open door for people to pass through.”

But here I was again, receiving words and images from him. This man who has played a seemingly miniscule, but in fact very influential, part in my life.

January 23

Today was literally filled with walking. Group walk through Port Meadow to The Church by The Perch, The Godstow Abbey, and The Trout Inn. Frost was everywhere in the most magical way.

I hear the students from outside my kitchen door, Jealous, by Nick Jonas is playing… everyone went to sleep, I started writing a song, “Hurry now…” before bed.

January 24 [market day]

…Through North Parade Farmer’s Market first, trying lavender chocolate, asking about gluten free bread, talking with Johan and getting a free piece of Turkish delight, pictures of fresh crab and meat pies. It was a cute setting and cheery day. Then walked on through Jericho…went around a corner to a Jericho mini market. Spent a while at a secondhand bookstore off Walton Street, loving over the old covers, wanting to buy every one. Continued on, pass University Press, getting colder, getting to Gloucester Green Giant Market. Never been to a Saturday one, but it would be a nice habit to start. No produce this time (only cheese and meats) but artisan craft tables. Pottery and clothes and china, etc. LOVE LOVE LOVE markets. The atmosphere of a local market. I don’t know why I love pedestrian areas so much, when people are all together, markets, downtowns… head to Covered Market to find a slight reprieve from the cold, and continue wondering past the produce, past the cafes, the thai shops, Ben’s Cookies, Moo Moo Milkshakes (with outrageous ques), looking through windows at The Cake Shop, going inside to admire the art and the artist, fondant featurettes.

Again, the hustle bustle, the getting to know a city, the discovering deeper into details of the city, the specific shops, the streets, the eats.

January 25

Wow, I left America twenty days ago. I can’t decide if that seems like forever or like a quick snap…the first activity of the day was attending a poetry reading at The Ashmolean on William Blake, for there is a festival going on in his honor these two weeks. That seemed like a very Oxford-esque thing, so I walked happily down there, chatted with the front desk, then snuck down the stairs to sit on a bench outside the circle of readers/literary fanatics, led by an older woman who spoke with a passionate voice. Someone gave me a grain of sand, as we all held the grain in our palm to think about Blake’s words “ To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower, Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hour.”

Oral History,"I interviewed my grandmother the night before Thanksgiving. My cousins were coming the next day, so we were both busy cooking the entire day. Finally, at eight o’clock in the evening, I sat down with my grandmother in the living room and began my interview.

Me: How did you learn about St. Thomas converting our forefathers?

My Grandmother: I heard this from my father’s family.

Me: Did you ever get into an argument about religion with your parents?

My Grandmother: No, never. There was nothing to argue about.

Me: Did you ever have any friends who were strongly against Christianity?

My Grandmother: I had Hindu friends, but they don’t tell me anything against Christianity, but they are very deeply devoted in their religion, the Hindus.

Me: Did British occupation around the time you were a child influence people’s feelings about Christians?

My Grandmother: In 1947 they left. I was 9, or rather 10 years old. So, at that time, I had just learned from history about it, but I can’t remember having seen the life of these British people in India.

Me: Where did you go to church?

My Grandmother: Puthenkavu Church in Chengannur Village. The village had a Marthoma church. It’s a very big church; the people were very rich. The private secretary of Puthennkavu came to our church, but my grandfather went to the Jacobite church, so we would go there sometimes. I’ve seen the priests; there were so many priests. They used to have their processions on the road. I’ve seen all that. They would sing by the front of our house. We would keep a lamp lit at the front of our house. It was the kind with oil and something burning that I can’t remember. It is lighted with a piece of cloth dipped in coconut oil that we put in a tray. In Malayalam, it’s called nelavalak. They changed the fashion now; it’s prettier. Everything the church people carry that walk to all the houses is decorated, like beautiful sheets. The achen (priests) comes; they have worship songs, and then they pray. We would then put our offerings onto a plate. We would use coins. Then, they would go to another house. They would come by with decorated umbrellas. They had four sticks that held a beautiful sheet that they would put over these achens to protect them from the sunlight and rain. My appachan (grandfather) was in the Orthodox Church; they had a thiramani (bishop) from Kerala.

Me: Hold on. I thought your grandfather was a part of the Jacobite Church.

My Grandmother: Jacobite and Orthodox are the same. They have the same bishops. They combined churches a while back. The greatest bishop has a residence in Kottayam. My grandfather’s eldest son’s house was bought by that bishop. It’s called Devalogam. It was very beautiful. It was so big and rich. Ordinary people cannot buy it, so the Jacobite people bought it for their thiramani.

Me: When you were a kid were you allowed to celebrate Onam?

My grandmother with her mother

My Grandmother: My mother would make chips for us, and if someone came, they would eat it too. But my appachan would get angry. He would not even eat the Onam curries or chips. You know for Onam, the Hindus only eat vegetarian curries that day, but my appachan won’t eat rice without meat except when it’s lent. The servants would want the Onam curries, so my ammachi (grandmother) would make it for them. That’s it.

Me: I know you went to college. At that time, did many girls go to college in Kerala?

My Grandmother: Yeah. Where I lived, the people were rich. If you did well in school, you would go to college.

Me: Did you choose what you wanted to major in college, or did your parents choose for you?

My Grandmother: I choose my subjects. In school also, in my time, everybody had to take all different kinds of languages. When my older cousins went to school, their school was in English because the British were there, but my school was given in Malayalam. We used to read and learn Shakespeare and other English poetry and prose. We also had to learn Hindi, but only one book of it. My parents would help me choose classes, but I made the choice to major in biology.

Me: Even though they got rid of the caste system, did you still see discrimination?

My Grandmother: Some people don’t like to see low caste. With us, we didn’t have many really low caste people in our school. In Alleppey Girl’s School, I remember this one child who was lower caste but had good color. The girls in the school one day helped give her a bath because she never took one. I think some people don’t keep their children clean, maybe because they didn’t have soap. The upper-class girls brought a dress for her and washed her old clothes. She was a small child. She looked very pretty. Some girls in my class were brave, they did whatever they like. If they think they are in the right path, they do it without asking the teachers. That I’m telling you because of the small child. I didn’t see much discrimination though because the school I went to had many rich people, people richer than me. The girls there used eyeliner and would put different flowers in their hair. From the top to bottom of their hair would be flowers. Sometimes jasmine, sometimes chrysanthemum. I think they would spray scents on their hair too. The hair is decorated in Kerala. Most kids used nail polish.

Me: Were you allowed to use nail polish?

My Grandmother: One day my friend put nail polish on me, but when my grandmother saw, she said that my grandfather would blame her for me wearing the nail polish, so I took it off. You know, I think I may have seen some discrimination actually. I remember my mother told me that people that worked for our house could not come near our house. They remained in our backyard. They couldn’t come near the door. My grandmother would give them food on a plantain leaf in our yard. You never give them food in a plate. In school, I never saw such a thing though. We would all sit together on the same bench. But, the Sudras would never come to school anyway. The alphabet was taught at home, so if you didn’t know that, you didn’t come to school. But Kerala is a great state; the caste issue wasn’t as big here I think.

Me: What are your favorite Kerala folktales that you read at school?

My Grandmother: We would read many stories in our books. We used to read Ballamithram. It was about a monkey and a crocodile. They crocodile became friends with the monkey, and when the crocodile’s wife wanted to eat the monkey, the crocodile then tries to kill the monkey. That’s the only story I remember. If you ask my brother, he can tell you a lot more stories. I had too much work to do in the kitchen to read for fun when I got older.

Me: When you were growing up, the communist revolution in Kerala began. Did you ever experience or see their protests?

My Grandmother: At that time, they weren’t allowed to protest. They were put in jail. Where I lived, they had protesters and those were put in jail. When I got up in the morning one day, I saw people marching when I looked out the window. They had on white clothes. There were also soldiers with guns walking with them. When I asked, my cousin said that those people with white shirts were put to jail since they were communists and were protesting. They were being taken from one police station to another. That I saw through the window. I was so scared. There were a lot of people.

Me: Why do you think communism became popular in Kerala?

My Grandmother: It is because the rich people had plenty of land. The farms with rubber and tea plantations were owned by rich people. The wages were small for the laborers. Every day they get wages, but not enough for them to have good food and clothing. So they started protesting. They saw other places were the laborers were paid more, so the increased their protesting. The kier (coconut husk soaked in water) was used to make the carpets in India. The ones you put in front of your door to clean your shoes. The owners of those factories were very rich, and the laborers were upset.

Me: At your college, did you have communist groups there?

My Grandmother: At my college, there was no such thing. Indira Gandhi came to our school though. She gave us a speech at our college for I think one hour. We were told to bring all our old shoes for the poor people.

Me: You were told to bring the shoes to the assembly?

My Grandmother: No, not the assembly. Right before she came. The office bearers in our school sent the shoes to the address Indira Gandhi gave. The assembly was later.

Me: What did she talk about?

My Grandmother: She talked about the poor. The flood that happened. That was who the shoes were for. The people affected by the flood. She talked about India, and the problems in it. She also gave us good advice for us students. I think she appreciated the neatness of the college too. The nuns there were very eager in keeping the place very beautiful and clean. No one was allowed to keep random paper in the room or outside the compound.

Me: How important is beef in Kerala?

My Grandmother: Every week people eat beef and cook beef. For Christmas, Easter, and any celebration, we eat plenty of beef curry and beef fried and beef cutlets. Different types of beef food.

Me: Do the Hindus in Kerala eat the beef?

My Grandmother: Some of them eat it. Back in the day the higher caste Hindus wouldn’t eat it. But when your dad was a kid, some of his Hindu Nair friends would eat it. I would give it to them when they came to our house. Some of my classmates wouldn’t eat beef, they would only eat chicken. And others are vegetarian.",https://medium.com/alappuzha-a-hidden-fortress-made-of-water/oral-history-1b7f094b8ce9,[],2015-12-10 07:25:40.812000+00:00,"['Travel', 'Food', 'Short Story']"
NOT ABORTING MY PLAN,"I was walking on campus today, backpack tight against my shoulders, one headphone in my ear, phone in my back pocket, when I saw a poster calling me a baby killer.

“Calling all Conservatives,” it read, and the first line said “do you enjoy hugging babies versus killing them?” The rest went on to spew more ultra-conservative propaganda, none of which bothered me nearly as much as that first line.

The truth is, whoever took the time to write those hateful words and then spread them all around campus didn’t have to say the word abortion for me to know what they meant. Abortions kill babies. Women who undergo abortions are baby killers.

I’m a baby killer.

Except, I know in my heart I am not a baby killer. Like the poster asks, I do enjoy hugging babies. I spent a week this summer with my 10-month old cousin; a beautiful, smiling, crying mess of a baby boy who my cousin chased around all day and night. I laughed when he smiled, walked with him on the beach, and pinched his cheeks because he was so darn cute. I also watched as my 35-year old cousin exhaustedly handed him over to my aunt every few hours, desperate for a nap or a glass of wine or just a few minutes alone. Sometimes, he’d bite her, hard, when he was teething. He crawled everywhere, and she had to watch him every second.

Choosing to have an abortion this summer was a hard decision, one I did not take lightly. Who would? But I know it was the right one. I am nineteen years old. When I found out I was pregnant I was not yet a sophomore in college. I still can’t legally drink. My only job experience is working in retail for a few years. I have never been in a serious relationship, and certainly never been in love. My life is still beginning.

The truth is, I met a boy this summer, and we really liked each other. It was fun being with him; I felt appreciated and desired. I think he felt the same. He was twenty years old, had a job but not a college degree. He had a young son, too, from a previous relationship where the girl did go through with her pregnancy. We didn’t know each other particularly well. He didn’t know some of the secrets I carry in my heart, because I was not ready to tell him; and I’m sure there were things he never told me. But, we enjoyed each other’s company. I loved playing with his dogs; I had dinner with his family once or twice. We stayed in his room fooling around on those hot summer nights after we’d both worked long days. And yes, we had sex. And one time we didn’t use protection.

It wasn’t until after we’d “broken up,” for lack of a better term, that I found out I was pregnant. I was packed up ready to return to Gettysburg and leave the summer behind when I realized my period was late. It was a fleeting thought, but one that stuck. I drove to the CVS and bought a pregnancy test. I peed and waited about two minutes, but I had trouble reading the results. It seemed positive, but I couldn’t tell. The panic began.

It wasn’t until a few days later, when my period still hadn’t come, and I had arrived in Gettysburg, that I really began to freak out. I looked down at my body, felt my arms and stomach with shaking hands, brushed the tears from my cheeks. The boy was far away from Gettysburg, but I was here, carrying this burden. I texted him to tell him my fears, and he couldn’t understand my alarm. When I told him that I would likely get an abortion if it turned out that I was pregnant, he didn’t seem to understand the weight of that decision. He relayed the earth shattering information that I was “not the first person to get pregnant” (was he sure about that one?) and told me to just call and make an appointment. In my bed, alone, I cried hot, angry tears that made my face swell and my heart beat fast. I could imagine my parents’ shame if they found out what had happened. I’d done dumb things in the past, and the thought of disappointing them again broke my heart.

I ended up going to the health center here on campus where the nurse practitioner took a pregnancy test and confirmed what I already knew: I was pregnant. In her office, I broke down again. She gave me a pamphlet to a clinic in Maryland, about an hour away, that administered abortions.

I was surprised to learn there was nowhere closer for me to go to, and a friend later told me that healthcare services for women, like Planned Parenthood, were being cut in Pennsylvania, like many other states around the country. I felt incredibly lucky to be close enough to Maryland that it wouldn’t be a problem to travel there. I had transportation to get there, as well. The procedure was about $400, and split between the boy and me, I could afford it. But, even if I couldn’t, if it came down to it, I could have asked my parents and they would have had the means to pay for the procedure. Even during all this internal chaos, I counted myself lucky for all these reasons. I wondered what girls who didn’t have my choices do in these situations. I wonder if the men and women advocating for the defunding of Planned Parenthood wonder the same things.

I scheduled my appointment as soon as I could, right after the first week of classes. It felt like a daze. One moment I was starting a new job, figuring out my major, looking to what the future would bring, and the next, here I was, the image of a positive pregnancy test stamped in my mind. The boy who helped make the pregnancy happen drove down to be with me, and although he didn’t understand what I was going through, it helped to have his presence there, if for nothing else than acknowledgment of his part in this pregnancy. It’s easy for men to walk away; even if it’s not easy, it’s possible. I didn’t have that choice and neither does any woman who ends up in the same place. The privileged men in Congress don’t seem to understand that distinction.

The clinic we went to was fine, just a normal, unassuming building. When we initially approached the place, I noticed some older people sitting in lawn chairs outside. I looked over and nodded at them, assuming they must live nearby. Two or three of them jumped up immediately.

“Are you guys going into the clinic?” A man asked, sticking out a pamphlet for me to take. I shrunk away. They gave one to the boy I was with, which listed “facts” about fetuses who can feel pain and baby-killers like myself. Luckily, there were workers from the clinic wearing bright “pro-choice” vests who grabbed us and ushered us inside, away from the protesters.

Once inside, the whole thing didn’t last more than an hour. I filled out paperwork, handed crumpled bills to the receptionist, (my insurance would have covered my abortion, but I didn’t know I had to get it approved in advance. The receptionist told me I could wait to get it approved and come back, but that didn’t feel like much of an option to me, not after all the waiting I had already done.) The boy stayed in the waiting room the whole time because “guests” weren’t allowed; which I suppose was his privilege. He missed the shots they gave me, the intake they took, and the abortion itself. And that was the worst part of all.

I don’t want to act as if the abortion was the worst pain I’ve ever gone through. Certainly not as painful as breaking a leg or falling off a tree. But, it felt like a different kind of pain. I felt alone, there in the white-painted doctor’s room with no one familiar around me. A nurse came in and held my hand, which I was grateful for. The doctor was a middle-aged man, and he was polite and quick but not particularly comforting. I suppose that wasn’t his job. I laid back on the table and let the tears spill down my cheeks as I felt the pressure go deep inside of me; I squeezed the nurse’s hand tight as she told me over and over how well I was doing. I felt like someone was reaching inside of me, squeezing my insides and pulling. I gripped the nurse’s hand harder.

Afterwards, I waited in the recovery room. Maybe I could have asked if the boy could join me, but I didn’t. I knew he wouldn’t understand. The nurses gave me pads to help the bleeding; my stomach hurt from the cramps, but mostly my heart hurt. I had always been pro-choice, and always will be. I believe no matter what the circumstances that a woman has the right to choose what happens to her body. And I didn’t feel guilty exactly, but I felt like a screw up. In some ways, I felt deserving of the physical and emotional pain I was in. I didn’t kill anyone; the thing inside of me was just a cell, but I did feel responsible for getting pregnant in the first place. Society tells us girls who get pregnant young, as teenagers, without a husband or serious boyfriend, are bad. Slutty. I had only been sexually active for about a year, with a few partners, and not many times. I didn’t feel slutty. I had enjoyed my time with the boy, had enjoyed the sex, but we’d made a mistake. Maybe it’s because we were young. Maybe we got lost in the heat of the moment. Maybe we weren’t thinking.

All I know is that I was not ready to be a parent. I’m happy to be a young woman in a country where I can explore who I want to be, have a career, and focus on family later in life (if ever). I’d never wanted to get married young or have children anytime in the foreseeable future. I’d never been in a long-term relationship. I didn’t know what love was. I wasn’t sure I even loved myself, so how could I care for a baby?

So yes, the decision I made to have an abortion was completely selfish. It was about me. Not about the boy who I’d had sex with (who, granted, definitely did not want a child either), or about the cell inside of me who might’ve grown into a fetus and then a baby if I’d let it. It was about me. Because I’d toiled on this earth for nineteen years, I’d developed inside of my mother’s womb when she was ready to have me, and I grew up in a home where I was wanted and loved, and was able to have all the opportunities I have now due in part to these things. And if I ever have a child they deserve the same things. And no anti-choice person, no man in Congress, no poster on a residential building, and no protester on the street, can tell me the choice I made was wrong.

For me, the choice was just right.

Journalism’s Theory of Change: From Community Engagement to Civic Action,"(This post was orriginally published on LocalNewsLab.org in 2014. I’ve updated the date references accordingly)

When the local news site Billy Penn launched in Philly last year USA Today’s Rem Rieder described the project as having a “strong civic impulse.”

For Jim Brady, the site’s founder, community is the starting place. At the Innovate Local conference at Montclair State University in 2014 Brady said that increasingly he wants to effect “our communities through action not just providing information” and he describes Billy Penn not as a news site but as “a platform for a better Philly.”

At one time, this overt emphasis on civic action would have raised red flags for many journalists. But increasingly we are seeing some newsrooms frame their work as a springboard for action. There is evidence of this shift in both nonprofit and commercial newsrooms, as well as a growing number of journalism schools which are explicitly training more community driven and action oriented students.

Last year the Christian Science Monitor redesigned their site with a major focus on helping people take action. The site features a “Take Action” section and on some stories the Christian Science Monitor offers “paths to action for readers who’ve been inspired by a story or something happening in the world.” My colleague Molly de Aguiar recently profiled Christian Science Monitor and two other publications that are using site design to invite more user engagement.

Also last year the Knight Foundation awarded a Prototype Fund grant to Chicago’s Public Good Software for the development of a “Do Public Good” button and an outreach campaign designed to “work with bloggers and media organizations to include a capability to take action (‘Do Public Good’) in the context of news articles.”

What is Journalism’s Theory of Change?

A few years ago, Jonathan Stray argued that “journalism has no theory of change.” He wrote, “I’ve taken to asking editors, ‘what do you want your work to change in society?’ The answer is generally along the lines of, ‘we aren’t here to change things. We are only here to publish information.’” But Stray doesn’t accept that answer, arguing, “Journalism without effect does not deserve the special place in democracy that it tries to claim.”

Today, I’d argue that journalism is still grappling to identify its theory of change, but we are beginning to see more experimentation around setting goals and measuring impact. And, just as there is no one business model for news, there is likely no one answer to this question of journalism’s role in making change. Newsrooms and communities have to navigate these questions about engagement together, and define the right focus for their goals.

“Journalism without effect does not deserve the special place in democracy that it tries to claim.” — Jonathan Stray

We are seeing a range of different theories expressed in new practices, new publications and new participants. Jan Schaffer, director of the J-Lab, has suggested a taxonomy of Authoritative, Activist and Advocacy journalism to describe various engaged models of reporting. She wrote in a Knight News Challenge application, “The Internet has done more than foster innovative platforms for distributing news and information. It is also leading to fundamental re-definitions of journalism itself… as more than just a commodity, but also as a catalyst to advance engagement and outcomes.”

Action Embedded in Our Mission

We see this renewed focus on outcomes at big newsrooms like ProPublica, whose mission is to “expose abuses of power and betrayals of the public trust by government, business, and other institutions, using the moral force of investigative journalism to spur reform through the sustained spotlighting of wrongdoing,” to small community media outlets like San Francisco’s People. Power. Media. which “amplifies voices from America’s marginalized communities to empower their efforts to impact public policy on housing, immigration and poverty issues.”

Non-profit newsrooms need to develop clearer theories of change and metrics for measuring impact in part to justify foundation funding. But, the drive to help communities use journalism in improving their neighborhoods is also coming from users themselves. As a recent study shows, readers liked stories more when they offered pathways to solutions, not just descriptions of problems.

“We want better communities. Journalism is one tool to get there.” — Chris Wink

On the commercial side, Street Fight just profiled Howard Owens of the Batavian and talked about civic organizations and political fights that were catalyzed by his reporting. And another Philly journalist, Chris Wink, the founder of Technical.ly Philly wrote recently, “We want better communities. Journalism is one tool to get there.” Wink argues that there is a lot involved with building stronger communities that falls outside the parameters of traditional journalism organizations. Indeed, a few years ago a study of news in Chicago found that non-traditional news and information sources, like community groups and advocacy organizations, are increasingly playing a critical role in covering local communities.

Educating Action Oriented Journalists

We are beginning to see seeds of that idea taking root in journalism schools as well. Last fall CUNY is launched a new master’s degree in social journalism, what Jeff Jarvis calls “a degree in outcomes-based journalism.” In a post announcing the new program, Jarvis writes that “journalism must shift from seeing itself primarily as a producer of content for masses to become more explicitly a service to individuals and communities. Content fills things; service accomplishes things” (original emphasis). The Annenberg School at the University of Southern California runs an initiative helping local news sites research their civic engagement and civic impact. The University of Texas at Austin has created the Engaging News project at the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life and in Chicago, the Medill School has launched what they call “a social justice news collective.”

For the past year, the Online News Association and a collection of funders, have been offering grants as part of a one million dollar Challenge Fund for Innovation in Journalism Education to “seed collaborative news experiments in living labs — their communities.” The Online News Association is not the only profession association working on these issues. The American Society of News Editors has partnered with Journalism That Matters to launch the Engagement Hub, with a focus on media diversity.

There are still big questions regarding how much this shift will actually reshape journalism. How many of these projects simply add a civic action layer over traditional journalism, versus fundamentally rethinking how journalism is done through the lens of civic engagement? In response to articles on Billy Penn, journalism professor Jay Rosen tweeted: “Things we argued for 20 years ago in the civic journalism movement now get built into news companies like brother.ly” (Billy Penn was orriginally named Brother.ly). That’s a good reminder that the changes we trace above have been in motion for a long time. All of these are indicators of a cultural shift within parts of the media, one that is very much still in process.",https://medium.com/the-engaged-journalism-lab/journalism-s-theory-of-change-from-community-engagement-to-civic-action-71f4786777c3,['Josh Stearns'],2015-12-23 14:37:59.877000+00:00,"['Journalism', 'Community Engagement']"

How You Can Make One Million Dollars,"First of all I am terribly sorry but I can not actually help you achieve that impressive sum that one million dollars is.

After I have defrauded your expectations, please do not think less of me and carry on a little further.

Why do you want one million dollars?

What a stupid question it is, you may wonder, who wouldn’t want to have all that money just to spent on whatever you fancy. But no, let’s really answer this question. So, let me reformulate it:

What would you do with one million dollars?

Well that is a bit more concrete. So let be honest with you, I personally would buy a house, a posh car, some good looking clothes, and take a long vacation. It seems pretty straight forward. Your answer may vary but I suppose it wonder differ much. But I wonder, how much do I need to do those exact things? Well after checking some prices online I come to the conclusion that with two hundred thousand dollars I would be able to do all that I mentioned above. Now my point here is:

How much is one million dollars?

Well, that is quite an hard question to answer because when we try to match it of the common world (number of pounds of vegetables, packs of cigarettes, etc) it soon loses all meaning. So, let me put it other way:

You (mostly likely) will never make you one million dollars

Sorry for ruining your dream when you first began to read this text, but if have an average salary and you saved it to the last penny, assuming that you save it whole, you will never even came close to one million dollars at the of your work life.

So why did you went out of your way to write something with a title that is a lie? What is wrong with you?

You may be thinking this by this point.

When you opened this text you had an expectation of some sort of how you can change your life by having more money, and that is ok. It means you care about your future. However, maybe you should start by rethinking your goals.

This is What I Think,"I’m not religious at all. I’ve had a history of questioning, doubts, and “that can’t be right” thoughts about some of the things I was taught/told. I didn’t like going to Sunday school and never really learned much from it. I claimed to be a Muslim for the longest time because that’s what I was born into, it was what my parents told me, and I didn’t want to make them feel bad or make them look bad in front of their peers if I was to say anything other than that publicly, when in all honesty, I don’t care what anyone else thinks about how I conduct myself.

I’m sure most of my family knows that I lead a pretty un-Islamic lifestyle. I don’t act like a heathen, I just live secularly. I’m still up in the air about God. If one exists, I don’t think this all-knowing entity really needs my reassurance that it’s the best. He knows what He’s done.

My parents did a fine job of raising me. I’m a responsible adult with bills that get paid every month, a fancy tree-hugger car and a great job. I am in a loving relationship, and have two cats that actually like my attention.

Religion did nothing more than instill good morals in me on how to treat other people and behave in society. This is essentially what all religions do.

Because of all this, I don’t like to get into religion or politics at all, because I will either end up with people with the same POV as me, which ends up with us patting each other on the back, or with someone that has an opposing view and will think whatever they say is right. Period.

So why have I been so caught up in the shooting at Oak Creek and the various hate crimes against Muslims/Mosques around the country lately? Because I believe the religions (and possibly race) involved don’t matter as much to mass media loving Americans. If a slew of churches were burned to the ground or shot at, it would be all over the place, and we can all guess who the bad guys would probably be.

Why aren’t the people who have committed these crimes called terrorists? Why are only local news stations telling these stories, and even for a couple of days? Why in the hell am I seeing people talking about Randy Travis’ DWI?

Fine, so most of America didn’t grow up Muslim or Sikh. Who cares? It’s a LOSS OF HUMAN LIVES and LOSS OF SAFETY AND PEACE in places that should be considered sanctuaries.

We are all humans. We live and work with each other every day and contribute to society together. Religion does not matter in the slightest. Why do some of us get the privilege of an outpouring of grief, and flags at half mast, and presidential visits and the others do not? How does one determine who deserves love and who does not? How can people be so oblivious to what is going on in their backyards? The regression of our country into Us vs Them?

I love my friends that have shown support, or have made an effort to understand what is happening and are sharing the articles I’ve been posting. I’d love if more of you took a little bit of time to see what’s happening in your country and how it might effect the people you know, or your fellow Americans, no matter their race or religion.

Every Father’s Day I Remember…,"It’s getting on seven o’clock Saturday night. I’m sitting in the kitchen, by myself, a pot of ribs in the oven, a pair of dinner settings on the table, thumbing through an out of date newspaper. There’s no sign of Andy anywhere. We had planned dinner at six so we could be finished before an eight o’clock football game he wants to watch with his friends, but he called around 5:30 to tell me he was running late. I am feeling squeezed; not an uncommon feeling when it comes to Andy.

Andy is my nineteen year old son, back in Cambridge after a rocky freshman year at Cornell where he learned what he doesn’t want from life — Ivy League pressure, fraternities, Engineering. He’s taking a year off, living with his mother, working part time as a lifeguard, taking two courses at a local college, and planning to hike the Appalachian Trail with some high school buddies come spring. Since being home he and I have dinner together once a week, a schedule I pronounced the day he returned, in a parental voice that disallowed negotiation. For me, it seems a paltry amount of time after spending three afternoons a week plus alternating weekends together for eighteen years. But to an adolescent fresh from a year of independence, I suspect I’ve created a burden.

The oven clock dings seven and my temper stirs. Maybe when he finally arrives I’ll remind him how important it is to keep appointments. But he did call, which was polite. Maybe I’ll demand a bigger time slot in the future so I’m boxed in between other plans. Maybe I’ll… The basement door opens, shuts. I catch a deep breath. Maybe I’ll just put my temper on hold, skip the disciplinary tone and let the evening evolve. After all, how many times did my father expect to have dinner with me when I was nineteen? Exactly never. Which is why I think it’s important.

“Hey Dad, sorry I’m late.” Andy bounds up the stairs, flushed from hurry. The kitchen throbs with youthful energy that smothers my anger. Andy stands taller than me, leaner too. He drapes a casual arm around my shoulder and smiles with an easy confidence I’ve seen him throw in a thousand directions. Still, when he tosses it my way, it makes me glow. Perhaps someday I will look at this young man, so different from me, without being dazzled. But the mystery of genetic fate made him my son, and my wonder has yet to wear off. Where I am rock, he is wheel; where I am Woody Allen, he is Brad Pitt; where I am the infield fly, he is the long ball; and although the world tolerates solid chumps, nebbish comics and spiked parabolas like me, it idolizes Andy’s fluid beauty and grace.

My son has a huge but simple appetite — long on protein, tolerant towards vegetables and salad, short on dessert. Dinner is ribs, ribs and more ribs plus a few raw carrots, rice and a mix of romaine, parmesan and Caesar. He is full of talk; he’s on to a new venture. Seems he did the math and realized that part-time lifeguarding was not going to generate the money he’ll need to spend four months hiking the AT. Although an extended walk in the woods is a valiant undertaking, his mother and I agree it’s not the same as sitting in a college classroom, so we’re not underwriting his adventure. His entrepreneurial response has been to post notices around the neighborhood seeking out odd jobs. I smile at the naiveté of telephone pole posters in an Internet world, but sure enough, Andy’s phone has been ringing. He spent the afternoon putting together furniture for a local business, will be painting a porch tomorrow and cleaning out an old woman’s basement on Monday. “I already have jobs lined up for next week; if I didn’t have classes on Tuesday and Thursday I could make a killing.”

After Andy reports his business news, our talk falls into a predictable pattern. I ask about his classes, he responds: They’re a breeze. I ask about lifeguarding, he responds: It’s the easiest job in the world. I ask about college transfer plans, he responds: I saw my old guidance counselor, I’m on track with paperwork. I ask about his sister, his high school buddies. There’s an interview quality to our exchange that reflects our father/son status. We’re close by the measures applied to that relationship, but far from friends. Some evenings, towards the end of the second helping, some thread of interest will take hold and our conversation will linger beyond the meal. We might latch on to politics, where Andy is well informed but uninterested; or science, on which he is keen; or even religion, which he finds incomprehensible. On those magic nights we transcend our litany of logistics and single-sentence responses. We explore ideas unbound from our prescribed roles.

But Andy eyes the clock. It’s almost eight, and I accept this will not be one of those nights. “Do you want any dessert?” I ask in the dim hope of delaying his departure.

“You know, some ice cream would be good after the ribs.” Ice cream is a staple in my house, on hand with greater predictability than milk or bread. I scoop us each a dish and ask if he’s seen any movies. “No time, but I’m reading this cool book at the pool, a Harlan Corbin mystery.” Lifeguards have long breaks, which Andy finds good for reading. Andy introduced me to Harlan Corbin.

I am deep in Les Miserables, the annual novel selected for my Great Books group. I explain how contemporary I find the style, the participatory narrator, and the tangential detours Victor Hugo takes to immerse the reader in 1830’s Paris. Andy relates my comments to his freshman seminar at Cornell. The clock slips past eight. Although he may consider his Ivy League year a waste; his critical thinking skills are keen and sharp.

Our spoons scrape the bottom of the ice cream bowls. Andy stands up, grabs mine, heads to the sink and starts to wash them out. I don’t even have to ask. I grab a towel and begin to dry. We stand side-by-side, silent in our simple tasks. I’m thankful that we never got in the habit of an automatic dishwasher.

“Dad, do you mind if I ask you a question?” Andy’s voice is measured, thoughtful.

My heart stops. Only a terrible question could require that preamble. But there is no choice in how to respond. “No, go ahead.”

“How did you do it? I mean, how did you and mom do it?” He struggles for words, which results in a question so broad I am baffled and a little worried.

“Do what?” He was three years old when his mother and I split. He’s never asked a single question about it. Even though she and I have one of those odd, lucky divorces where we remain civil and sometimes friendly, he must know that at some time in the past, a time proximate to his birth, a volcano erupted and two reasonable people who had committed their lives to one another forever, crumbled under the folly of such optimism. We’ll never know how the separate lives she and I carved out of our diminished, if more realistic, expectations, affected the children we raised.

“How did you teach me and Abby to be responsible? How did you know when to give us what we wanted and when to hold back?”

“Do you mean why didn’t we give you money for the Trail? I know some of your other friends’ parents are contributing.”

“No, that’s not it; I mean I guess that’s part of it. You see, I have to make the money and so I am making it, and they don’t have to make it and so they’re just hanging around. How did you know that it would be better for me to make the money myself?”

I pushed the well of sentiment in my chest aside; this would be a poor moment to cry. I focused on his words. “There is no formula, Andy. Your mother and I make it up as we go along, just like you do.”

“No you don’t.” He sets a dripping plate in the rack and looks me in the eye. “You and mom are not random. You’re the furthest thing there is from random.”

I laugh. It’s rewarding, but also creepy, when your children come to know you so well. “It’s about consistency, and having guidelines. Some things are easy. We pay for college, but we don’t dole out party money. The grey areas are trickier. Like last year when you were having a tough time and so I paid for your spring break trip; but this year we figured if you really wanted to do the Trail, you have the time and ability to make the money yourself. Sometimes you’re still a kid and need a little extra help; but sometimes it’s good for you to shoulder your own load.”

“Well, just for the record, you should know that you’re doing it right.” Andy looked out the window as he said this, which I appreciated. Compliments between guys are always awkward.

“Thanks.” This was enough deep bonding for one evening. I had gotten more than I could expect from our dinner; it was time to set him free. “So, where are you guys watching the game tonight?”

Four questions you should ask before visualizing your data,"Hmm, something looks fishy here. These numbers aren’t adding up!

A picture is worth a thousand words — at least, that’s how the old saying goes. But how many numbers is a picture worth? Perhaps that’s a more interesting question given the amount of charts and graphs created every day. We need to distill all the data available to us through charts and visualizations to convey a clear message. It’s the message the inspires action to change the world — or your organization.

Why is data visualization so important?

It helps you and your audience see insights that weren’t obvious before. You can present information intuitively to individuals who don’t need to know how to interpret raw data. It can capture the attention of your audience and make your viewpoint stand out.

While many data visualizations can be incredibly useful, visualizing data incorrectly can be disastrous. In Edward Tufte’s book, Visual Explanations, Tufte explains how a bad visualization did not convey crucial information about the danger of cold temperatures on O-rings that ultimately caused the Challenger Shuttle to explode.

This visualization doesn’t convey the dangers of low temperatures

The chart above was the original NASA visualization — hard to figure out what these scientists were trying to tell their colleagues, right? They were showing the damage to the O-rings and the temperature is associated with each launch, but we don’t inherently see the correlation between the two. There is also a lot of chartjunk, as Tufte refers to it, which pulls our attention away from the actually data and focuses it on the pictures of the rockets. Another fatal flaw in this chart is the order of the rockets — rather than showing it by temperature, it shows it by launch date. This only helps mask the dangers of launches in cold temperatures. Tufte’s re-visualization of the same data (below) eliminates all the noise and shows the most important elements of the data: temperature vs. O-ring damage.

Now we can see the dangers of launch more clearly with the dotted curve and clearly labeled axes.

Now this chart is much clearer about the projected dangers of launching the shuttle in cold temperatures. The axes are clearly defined, the trend is marked in red, and the title outlines the purpose of the chart. Out of the 13 charts that were prepared before the launch, none of them conveyed the risks clearly to the decision-makers.

Of course, not everything is this extreme — most visualizations that aren’t well thought-out might convey the wrong idea or erroneous data without endangering lives. If you’re looking to capture attention and drive your insights forward, here are four questions to ask as you visualize your data.

Who is your audience? Knowing the prior knowledge of your audience is a key component of creating a good visualization. Make sure you think about what the viewers already know about the subject you’re presenting and adjust your visualization accordingly. What is the message you need to convey? This should be your guiding light throughout the creation of your visualization. First, focus on the variables you need to visualize in order to get your message across — make those variables the focus of your graph. What relationship do they have and what type of chart should you use for that? Interactive charts are very engaging for individuals, but does it make sense for a group presentation if it can only display bits of information at a time? The format comes into play when you tackle the next question. What data should you display? More data does not always equal better data. Use your judgment to determine what data points and categories are most important to convey your message. Use the data to determine what type of visualization makes the most sense — make sure that it clearly shows the relationship between the variables that are most important to your message. Keep it clean and visually appealing for maximum impact. Is this visualization intuitive? If your audience cannot understand your graph within the first 30 seconds it is displayed, you need to rework your chart. Keep to conventions that people understand so they don’t have to work hard to get your message.

As long as these questions are driving your visualization, you will create a chart that not only conveys your message, but also remains memorable in the minds of your audience.

Review: Inside Out,"It’s kinda hard for a movie like this to be the one you figure on writing reviews with straight out the gate. You risk unduly HANGING the next 6 months’ worth out of some stupid ‘objectivity’ calculus. Really though, your ‘joy’ aspect does fire real hard on Inside Out. That’s one bright spark in amongst the opaque dreck of other CG-fat expositions hammering hard at a tired, tired fructose-fired neuron. Now I’m tempted to make up lost time and wail like an impotent dummy at the billion dollar march of bigger meteorites, bigger muscles and bigger mutants but I’ll spare that litre of cortisol for another day (Ant Man appropriate?). There are two basic ways Inside Out fundamentally differs.

Structurally: It’s largely set in the mind of an 11 year old girl driven fairly collaboratively by her 5 emotions (Fear, Disgust, Joy, Anger and Sadness). Together they manage how young Riley weaves and stores memories, each recorded on spheres coloured for their associated emotion (disaster threatens when Sadness reluctantly develops the temptation to touch and ‘taint’ the spheres, around the time Riley moves to a new city). It checks in with the corresponding parental devices now and then but it amounts to a road movie to her Joy and Sadness. It involves no start in a shiny lab or classified G-Man agency, then to a jeopardised city, then space, then God firing divine palm-lasers at a galactic repto-cyborg hybrid (apologies Scientologists). It’s an internal voyage between geographic & architectural metaphors of her waking hours, dreams, train-of-thought, imagination, etc.

But I’m making this sound too mechanical, its movements are so light touch. You needn’t actively scratch your head over every detail for significance. Weird as it may sound, pretentious maybe, I found thinking about Inside Out wasn’t just what I was doing in my head; every well strung scene’s kinesis was thought in action. Let’s park that idea though. No joke or ‘landmark’ is milked and little symbolic relevance spoon-fed but there’s a fair amount for even the youngest, card-carrying silly-billies.

Movie Madness,"From Godard’s Contempt.

Nothing’s quite as recursive, nor a better inducement to madness than seeing your filmed image tomorrow of what you’re doing today. A well cut, professionally shot movie, posted anonymously to Youtube, and linked to from Facebook, concerning the mundane adventures of your daily life, today, watched from your phone on the M train tomorrow.

Relics of New York,"Relics of New York

Inspired by my new novel, ‘The Relic Master’

New York City may not be Rome, but that doesn’t mean it lacks for relics. And Rome has a slightly unfair advantage, since it’s been around since the eighth century B.C., and New York (originally New Amsterdam) really only got started in the 1630’s.

For your consideration, here are five relics right here in the greatest city in the world:

1. St. Datian. Church of the Most Holy Redeemer, 173 East 3rd Street (East Village).

Saint … who? According to the church’s website, Saint Datian may (or may not) have been the jailer of St. Vincent. According to the legend, he converted and was then martyred by the Romans. His bones arrived here in 1892, courtesy of a wealthy Italian lady. Urban legend bonus: they may actually be the bones of a policeman who died defending the collection boxes.

2. St. Frances Cabrini, known as Mother Cabrini. St. Frances Cabrini Shrine, 701 Fort Washington Avenue, upper Manhattan.

One of my favorite saints. An Italian-born nun, she came to the U.S. in the late 19th century to help the great wave of Italian immigrants and opened many orphanage and schools. Died 1917, canonized 1946. Most of her body is at the shrine. An arm is in Chicago. If you want to view her head, you’ll need to go to Rome. Apparently everyone wanted a piece of her.

3. Padre Pio. Church of Saint John the Baptist, 210 West 30th Street.

Padre Pio is said to have received the stigmata, which is to say, crucifixion-like wounds on the palms and feet. These periodically bled. (Relics are not for the faint of heart.) Here you’ll find displayed a bloody sock, a scab (warned you), a bit of hair and fountain pen.

4. Pierre Toussaint. Saint Patrick’s Cathedral, Fifth Avenue.

Pierre was born a slave in Haiti. His owners brought him to New York in 1797, fearing a revolution. They were smart to do so, since the revolution took place shortly thereafter and was extremely sanguinary.

Pierre was freed in 1807 and became a hairdresser to New York’s society dames. (As Cindy Adams would say, “Only in New York, kids.”)

He was a benefactor of the original St. Patrick’s in modern-day NoLita. He was buried in its churchyard, whose wall protected it from attacks by violent anti-Catholic mobs. His remains were moved to the crypt below the main altar in the new St. Patrick’s.

5. Peter Stuyvesant’s Pear Tree (or what’s left of it). New York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West.

You don’t have to be Catholic to leave behind a relic. Peter Stuyvesant, the famously grouchy governor of New Amsterdam who surrendered the city to the English in 1664, planted a pear tree on his farm, at what is now the intersection of 13th Street and Third Avenue. The tree lived to a ripe old age, until some idiot in 1867 ran his carriage into it, toppling it. One can only hope he got a ticket.",https://medium.com/galleys/relics-of-new-york-31e09472b288,['Christopher Buckley'],2015-12-04 20:15:02.462000+00:00,"['Religion', 'Catholic', 'New York']"
99% Invisible Podcast’s Brilliant Response to Criticism of Women’s Voices,"Vocal Fry:

Women are just doing it wrong! Again.

The This American Life podcast receives enough complaints about women’s voices that they recorded a whole segment about it in January called “Freedom Fries” to discuss the issue of vocal fry. Here is an example of vocal fry from what appears to be a fairly sexist study on the matter:

The above video, which summarizes a study from Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, notes that men’s lower voices are thought of as more authoritative than women’s voices overall, even when women’s voices don’t exhibit vocal fry. The host, Bill Mayew, goes so far as to task women, not men, with changing what is lately deemed a poor speech habit for them in particular.

It is inappropriate for Mayew to blame women’s voices for their own lack of success rather than frame the negative perception of women’s voices as part of our culture’s larger bias to value the authority of men over women. He’s running headlong into the dangerous logic of rape apologetics, which blame women’s choices of dress and location for the violent crimes people choose to commit against them.

Using this specious line of thinking, women are considered culpable for the professional harm that comes to them, even though both men and women commonly exhibit the vocal trait. When women’s vocal fry is framed as what undermines their professional advancement, not the basic fact that they are women, the message is clear: it’s not men or a biased culture that need changing. Women are just doing it wrong again! Again.

The truth is that this isn’t about vocal fry nearly as much as it is about our culture’s response to women in general. As a result, policing the sound of women’s voices is nothing new, and what people complain about changes over time. According to host Ira Glass, This American Life’s…

…listeners have always complained about young women reporting on our show. They used to complain about reporters using the word “like” and about upspeak…But we don’t get many emails like that anymore. People who don’t like listening to young women on the radio have moved on to vocal fry.

The real irony of the above Duke University video is that Bill Mayew exhibits vocal fry throughout, and no one thought it enough of a problem to correct in a video about the professional dangers of vocal fry. His voice is fine, because we assume his authority.

Don’t believe it? Here is another example of privileged male vocal fry: Noam Chomsky. He’s been speaking in public with vocal fry for over 50 years, and I bet his superiors have never received a tide of letters to complain about his voice. I chose a video of a much younger Chomsky to show that his vocal fry is not simply a product of his age:",https://medium.com/speak-louder/99-invisible-podcast-s-brilliant-response-to-criticism-of-women-s-voices-2d39f49a0569,"['Elan Morgan', 'Schmutzie']",2015-07-14 06:54:23.649000+00:00,"['Women', 'Podcast', 'Feminism']"
Where Should We Stay for the Wedding?,"FROM: Katie

TO: Everyone

Hello all!

I hope everyone is as excited about the upcoming wedding as I am!

S thought it might be fun to have some/all of the bridesmaids stay in a few houses near the venue, and her mom has reserved some houses.

Below I’ve pasted the links to the places her mom reserved, as well as how many bedrooms each place has, and how much it will cost per night (these places might say they have no availability for the nights we need, but that’s because she’s already booked them). If you were planning on doing your own thing, that’s cool — just wanted to spread the word and people can organize amongst themselves/decide what they wanna do!

Looking forward to seeing you guys in a few short months!

Hey —

I talked to everyone else and they’ve all got their own things figured out, so I was wondering if you think we should go ahead and book a place to stay for the wedding weekend. I called the Omni where they have a block of rooms and the price w/tax is $299.70 per night, which isn’t cheap.

I did some looking around and found a house we could rent.

It’s $601 for the 2 nights at this place, but it still might be a better deal — 2 bedrooms, 1.5 baths and also it’s a house not the Omni?

"Life is about Moments, So is the Market.","“The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.” -Bill Gates

Consider two irrefutable aspects of human lives that materialize every day:

1. The first is about the human element. We all know some way or the other that life is all about moments. It is lived in moments and moments are what define the existence of any individual.

2. The second pertains to mobile technology. Much has been said about the incredible ways in which smartphones have changed the forms in which humans interact with the outside world. We are spending a significant proportion of our days’ time in the virtual world dealing with real life entities. And interacting with the social circle is merely a part of it. There is a lot out there on the web waiting to be discovered.

What happens when both these aspects concur? We get what Google is now calling ‘Micro-Moments’.

Micro-Moments are “intent-driven” moments when people turn to a mobile platform to find what they need. Internet sessions of a day are basically a sum of these countless mini-sessions of “I-want-to-know, I-want-to-buy, I-want-to-go, and I-want-to-do” moments.

“Future is mobile computing — smartphones and tablets are just elements of it. The industry is on the verge of a whole new paradigm.” — Thorsten Heins

· Of smartphone users, 91% turn to their cellphones for some information while doing any task.

(Source: Consumers in the Micro-Moment, Google/Ipsos, U.S., March 2015, n=5,398, based on internet users.)

· 62% of smartphone users are more likely to take action right away toward solving an unexpected problem or new task because they have a smartphone.

It’s all about these micro-moments. By doing a series of surveys Google has identified how these small moments are critical in defining the flow of taste and capital in the consumer market.

So the question arises, is your brand there when the curiosity of a person about the latest cellphone takes them to the doors of the web? Or during the eleventh-hour shopping when it becomes hard to decide what product to choose and why? Showing up in immediate searches can be very valuable for you, as it not only makes your brand seen but also gives you a powerful chance to expand your customer base.

· 82% of smartphone users consult their phones while they’re in a store deciding which product to buy. One in ten of them end up buying a different product than they originally planned.

(Source: Consumers in the Micro-Moment, Google/Ipsos, U.S., March 2015, n=5,398, based on internet users.)

The one-way broadcast marketing is a thing of past. In the times of need, people don’t care for the brand as much as they care for quenching the thirst of the hour. So no matter how much you are popular because of TV commercials, and how much quality you offer, when it matters you have to be there.

· 69% of online consumers agree that the quality, timing, or relevance of a company’s message has an impact on how they perceive the brand.

(Source: 22. Consumers in the Micro-Moment, Google/Ipsos, U.S., March 2015, n=5,398, based on internet usersGoogle/TNS/Ogilvy, U.S., June 201

Here are a few ways which you can take care of to build on your mobile marketing strategy.

1. Show UP

Realize your micro-moments and BE THERE. Be present in those micro-moments when anyone turns to web to search anything related to your brand. A market survey and SEO are the keys here.

Google talks about how FIAT marked a bellowing return to the US market after 28 years with their small and efficient FIAT 500. The market was in need of such a product and when anyone Googled anything related to small, city cars, FIAT was there to regain trust and promise efficiency.

2. Keep a phone nearby

When anyone finds your brand in those little hours of need, chances are they might want to gain more details. The best way to do this is by keeping a clear channel of communication ready 24X7.

3. Be Swift and Suitable

If things are happening in micro-moments you cannot afford to waste time on irrelevant details. You cannot always anticipate what the users are going to want. So, expand your list of micro-moments and show up every time.

These three form the very basic of steps that can be done to ensure a stronger mobile marketing. Obviously, when they have enough time, people will focus specifically on the brands that they already have on their mind. But what if they are looking for something new? Or when there is some urgency? Or something in which people are stepping in for the first time? In moments as these, consumers will be open to be influenced by any brand that can promise to be worthwhile. These are the moments which lay out a fine ground for you to cement your name in the market. So why not be there, ready to make the moment yours?",https://medium.com/applozic-plug-play-messaging/life-is-about-moments-so-is-the-market-bb777bc33978,['Nitin Chauhan'],2015-11-30 05:15:43.266000+00:00,"['App Marketing', 'Mobile Marketing', 'Apps']"

Five things great brands will do differently on social media in 2015 #DigitalSense,"Social media marketing came of age in 2014 with Facebook named advertising medium of the year and big brands doubling down on their paid media investment. Marketers have begun realising that these channels have huge potential to drive results when done right. It’s a good time to take stock and think about what brands could be doing even better going forward and here are five suggestions I think should shake up the industry a little in 2015.

1) Deprioritise some of that data You’ll hear a lot about big data, but while statistics can be revelatory they’re more commonly the scourge of social media marketing. Just because you can follow every like, comment and retweet doesn’t mean you should — in fact the kinds of activities which pander to driving these digital actions tend to be the worst kind of digital marketing. So-called engagement metrics are at best measuring the tip of an iceberg and give only the slightest indications of whether your content is truly driving actual business results, offering surprisingly little correlation with actual return on investments (ROIs). The data that matters shows if you’ve truly affected the hearts and minds of your consumers, or ultimately driven them to purchase, and today any businesses can use simple online survey tools to monitor their ongoing brand metrics.

2) Realise that less is more If engagement data has driven marketers to cats, babies and competitions then the seeming pressure to post something every day has driven them to stock photography and possible insanity. Consumers have no expectations of hearing from brands every day and actually probably a strong feeling that they’d rather not. Creating less content means brands can realistically put paid media behind every single post and ensure a meaningful number of people are reached with their message (something which correlates far better with ROI and sales). The answer to how many posts should I create is often pretty simple — how many can you afford to put paid media behind?

3) Tell true brand stories Getting off the treadmill of daily creative executions means brands can put more effort into what they do post and they can stop jumping on every event and meme just to find something to say. Great social media content isn’t about tricking someone into clicking like, it’s about being remembered by that person days later. That means telling powerful stories, while staying true to your brand’s essence, and increasingly it will mean higher production values and more video. Remember that more people can now see a heavily-promoted Facebook post in a day than would see an advert you ran during the X Factor final.

4) Get more personal If reaching millions of people with great content sounds too much like traditional broadcast media then personalisation at scale is where unique digital creativity comes in. In 2015, there’s no reason to be reaching all your potential consumers with the same piece of creative when you can use simple targeting and basic adaptations (even just tweaking video thumbnails or lines of copy) to make it personally interesting to them all. Don’t take it too far though, as people aren’t ready to be stalked by adverts that address them by name.

5) Throw a laptop at a creative Not just out of frustration that they’re pitching a complicated digital activity no one will ever do, but because they’re showing it to you on a laptop in the first place. In 2015 as much asthree quarters of social media marketing will be seen by consumers on their mobiles so if you’re not considering how your campaign looks on a 5-inch screen then you’re out of touch. If some interactivity isn’t mobile compatible then why are you doing it at all?

Ok, violence in the workplace is never acceptable, but if 2015 is going to be the year that social media marketing truly starts delivering for brands then the industry does still need a bit of a common sense shake-up. Detailed consumer interaction and customer service are vital in some sectors, but anyone not seeing the chance to go large on social media is missing out on the biggest innovation of them all.

Lessons I learnt visiting four churches in two weeks — Part #2,"Last week we began a two-part series sharing my experiences after visiting four churches in two weeks. We looked at some of the communication strategies and each of these churches were using, and got some great ideas that every church should try out, and also identified some weaknesses we should be aware of in our own churches. Today we’ll take a look at the third and fourth church we experienced.

As was mentioned last week, the purpose of this article is not to criticise the individual churches in any way. My hope is that through this blog, I can humbly share my experiences, both good and bad, for the purpose of equipping and encouraging other churches world-wide to continue striving for excellence in the way we do church, for the glory of God alone.

For the purposes of this article, I won’t be commenting on the actual theological content of the sermons, or components of the service that are very much dependent on individual tastes and preferences (eg song choice, décor, etc), but will be focusing more on processes, systems and logistics that get people in the door, and keep them coming back!

Church #3

A large church of around 3000 members over multiple services and campuses.This service took place in the church’s newly constructed worship centre, which from the moment we entered resounded of “purpose built”.

Things that were awesome (other churches should follow suit!)

The service started on time

Sounds obvious, right? But actually, the number of churches (including mine) that start 5–10 minutes late is surprisingly high. And there is some logic behind starting late. Some churches who have car parks some distance from the actual auditorium deliberately allow their service to start late to give newcomers “five minutes grace” to get from their car to the auditorium without missing the start of the service, but this has its downfalls. As soon as churches allow their services to start late, people start realising, which then causes the people to deliberately arrive late themselves, knowing the church will wait for them. We want to encourage our people to be self-disciplined and prioritise church enough to arrive on time, and starting services late can sent the wrong message about the seriousness of why we gather. The church I visited started at 10:30 on the dot. The room was mostly empty — everyone was still talking or drinking coffee in the foyer, but they started anyway. By the end of the first song, the room was full and God’s people were singing, but by starting on time, the tone of the meeting was set to be one of high regard and importance, not casual and flippant. Yes, it felt awkward seeing the service leader speak to an almost-empty auditorium, but maybe churches should embrace the awkward, start on time, and train their people that church is worth arriving on time!

We were taken right to the door of Sunday School

As we entered church, child-in-hand, we were greeted by a welcomer who asked if we needed some help navigating our way to the children’s facilities. Although he, himself, wasn’t 100% sure which classroom was the right one for our child, he promptly found someone who could help us, and they walked us right to the door of our son’s classroom, where we were asked to sign in and make known any allergies or medical conditions. I left the kids’ department feeling confident that my son was in good hands and would be taken care of by volunteers who were organised and prepared. Filling visiting parents with confidence is one of the best ways to ensure they’ll come back the next week!

A slide displayed where the Bible reading fit in the context of the whole Bible

This was an idea I had never seen before — the reference for the Bible reading was displayed on screen, and above the book’s name, the previous two books of the Bible were listed. The following two books of the Bible were displayed underneath. I thought this was a clever way of helping newer Christians (or not-yet-Christians) navigate their way through books of the Bible without feeling confused, overwhelmed by page flicking, or lost in contents pages.

Things that could have been better (make sure your church doesn’t do this!)

The Service Leader announced he would be waiting in the visitors’ lounge, but never showed up

The church had a beautiful, dedicated “Welcome Lounge” where visitors could come and chat with volunteers and staff after the service. The Service Leader who announced this said he would be waiting at the lounge to meet visitors (and we later found out it was standard practice for the Service Leader to always head to the lounge after church), but he never showed up. No harm done, as there were other volunteers around, but that one familiar face could be all that was needed to put a visitor at ease. I get it — things come up. He probably got caught up in a conversation — things happen. But church leaders should do all they can to follow through with what is announced on stage, and if there is some doubt as to whether something will eventuate, it’s better to not mention it at all.

The musicians looked bored

This may be bordering on a stylistic preference, but my feeling was that during the singing, everyone on stage looked miserable. As a muso myself, I understand that playing well requires concentration, and sometimes we just don’t think to smile — but for the leader and singers especially, it’s important to reflect in our faces the joy we’re singing about in our songs. We can’t be sending mixed messages. The singing will probably be one of the first things a visitor experiences, so let’s ensure guests to our church see that we’re glad to be worshipping God!

Final thoughts

Aside from the “building envy” I encountered enjoying all their beautiful facilities, we had a great time at church and it was a privilege to hear God’s Word preached once again. This was an amazingly equipped church, both materially and spiritually, and it was encouraging to God blessing the ministry of this church.

Church #4

Full disclosure: we didn’t actually attend this church’s service, but not for lack of trying. Twenty minutes after arriving our son started throwing up in the garden, so we (reluctantly) needed to leave early…But we were around for long enough to gain some insights into what a visitor would experience coming to this church for the first time.

This church was a small afternoon congregation of mostly young adults. They don’t have a building of their own, and instead utilise another church’s building and facilities.

Things that were awesome (other churches should follow suit!)

There were people to welcome us right from the car park

As soon as we stepped out of the car and headed to the building, people were ready with a smile to greet us and welcome us to church. We knew we were in the right place, and could see they were glad to have us there.

They embraced technology

This church made intentional decisions based on its people. Instead of printing paper sermon outlines and newsletters that were never read or used, the leadership identified their congregation’s demographic, and began using free Bible apps to distribute sermon notes, Bible readings and church notices. They were tapping into the culture and worldview of their people and embracing it, rather than fearing or avoiding it.

Things that could have been better (make sure your church doesn’t do this!)

The tap didn’t work in the ladies’ toilet

Okay, so this wasn’t their fault — it wasn’t their building. But my issue was the fact that it was simply assumed that “everyone knows to use the men’s toilet instead”. I didn’t know to use the men’s toilet. A simple sign on the loo saying “tap broken, use men’s toilet instead” could save saved confusion, as well as making it clear that they were aware of their issues and were dealing with them, rather than ignoring problems and assuming everyone knew the work-around. When it comes to making your church visitor-friendly, my motto is “never assume”. Make everything crystal clear, over-communicate, and leave no room for doubt or uncertainty!

They didn’t have any info to give me

Although I couldn’t stay for the service, I would have loved to have received a brochure, booklet, flyer, or even business card, to find out more about their church, but they had nothing to offer me. Although I’m a huge advocate for digital and social media, print media still has its place, and churches ought to be ready with even a basic “visitor info sheet” with service times, contact details, location, facilities for babies, children and youth, and maybe a mission statement or message from the pastor.

Final thoughts

We were so sad to not be able to stay for the service — this church is very dear to us and we have a great love for the people who lead it, so we were really looking forward to mutual encouragement by coming along. But even our brief encounter was enough to see that they have some great initiatives in place to reach a very particular demographic for Jesus.",https://medium.com/gospel-powered-stories/lessons-i-learnt-visiting-four-churches-in-two-weeks-part-2-d80b4e000a2e,['Gospel Powered'],2015-12-30 00:09:49.526000+00:00,"['Communication', 'Church', 'Christianity']"

20. It Makes You WISE(R)

It gives you perspective: By observing your mind, you realize you don’t have to be slave to it. You realize it throws tantrums, gets grumpy, jealous, happy and sad but that it doesn’t have to run you. Meditation is quite simply mental hygiene: clear out the junk, tune your talents, and get in touch with yourself. Think about it, you shower every day and clean your body, but have you ever showered your mind? As a consequence, you’ll feel more clear and see thing with greater perspective. “The quality of our life depends on the quality of our mind,” writes Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. We can’t control what happens on the outside but we do have a say over the quality of our mind. No matter what’s going on, if your mind is ok, everything is ok. Right now.

It Keeps You Real

Once you get to know your mind, you start to own your stuff and become more authentic, maybe even humble. You realize the stories and soap operas your mind puts you through and you gain some perspective on them. You realize most of us are caught up in a mind-drama and become more compassionate towards others.

And…the more you meditate, the more you seem to benefit, research studies such as this one suggest.

Myths about Meditation

Having an empty mind — nope, in fact, when you start meditating, you’ll find its quite the opposite

Sitting in lotus position — nope, you can sit on the couch (just don’t lie down, you’ll fall asleep)

Sitting for an hour a day — nope, small doses work just fine, (see here and — by yours truly — here) Chanting in a language I don’t understand — nope, not unless that floats your boat

Buddhist, Hindu or religious — nope, not unless you make it so

Weird — what’s so weird about sitting and breathing? Besides, US congressmen, NFL football leagues and the US Marine Corps are doing it, how weird can it be?

Wearing robes — what? “I can’t meditate” because

I can’t clear my mind — no worries, while you’re sitting there you’ll experience the noisy chaos of a wound up mind that’s unwinding: tons of thoughts, feelings and emotions. Don’t worry about how you feel during, notice how you feel after and throughout the rest of the day

I can’t sit still — that’s ok, just sit comfortably, fidget if you need to

I get anxious — that’s also normal, all the junk’s coming up, learn some breathing practices to calm yourself down, exercise or do yoga before meditating I hate sitting still — that’s fine, then go for a walk without your earphones, phone etc; or start with yoga; or do breathing exercises…give yourself time to just “be” without constantly “doing” something

I tried and I hated it — there’s not just one kind of meditation, there’s a whole menu out there, look for the shoe that fits: mindfulness, Transcendental, compassion, mantra, Vipassana, Art of Living breathing practices, yoga nidra, yoga, insight, loving-kindness, tai chi etc…

I don’t have time — if you have time to read an article about meditation all the way through, you have time to meditate. Think of all those minutes you waste every day on the internet or otherwise, you can definitely fit in 20 minutes here or there to give your life a boost! Gandhi is quoted as saying “I’m so busy today, that… I’m going to meditate 2 hours instead of 1.”",https://medium.com/gethealthy/20-scientific-reasons-to-start-meditating-today-new-research-shows-meditation-boosts-your-health-d701e0c50a16,['Emma Seppälä'],2015-04-14 03:20:09.344000+00:00,"['Happiness', 'Meditation', 'Health']"
Why can’t you lose weight? (Part 2),"I realised that cultural ideals are awful criteria’s put in place that are totally superficial and actually mean nothing. They are just another form of social compliance, and who said that we have to comply to be accepted? Especially in degrading manners like being made fun of if you’re not fair and slim — why should you deserve to feel like you’re not worthy, or depressed because you don’t meet the expectations of a few? A lot of these people who comment on external factors are not even aware of the struggles that some people face; some people find it extremely hard to lose weight due to so many reasons such as medical reasons or general health issues, and I bet if they knew just how strong you really are, these cultural ideas wouldn’t even exist!

In the real world, these expectations don’t actually matter, and once you absorb them into your healthy minds, they will spread and sort of “contaminate” your thoughts of yourself (I’m sure you can sense my hatred) you’ll see yourself through false eyes that will only notice the negative. Of course, no one is perfect, and everyone has imperfections, however to highlight them on a daily basis can seriously affect yours and others’ mentality and would drive anyone to the point of breaking — but we’re not going to let that happen.

Tackling stigma around anything relating to culture can be challenging let alone something as sensitive as weight and appearance, however, it can be done.

1) Stop listening to the backward sayings of ANY culture, even western culture has ridiculous standards too, because the more you listen, the more you will notice the “wrong” things about yourself.

2) Start listening to your mind, really challenge the ideas that pop up and say “You’re not good enough”, “You’re never going to fit in”, “You’re obese, overweight and ugly”, with “Who said I’m not good enough? I am the creation of Allah, and that is good enough for me”, “Why do I need to fit in? Fit into what? A culture that doesn’t accept me for what I am? No thanks!”. I’m not telling you to kid yourself — be true to yourself, and know that no one really “fits” into anything, and no one is “ugly”.

3) If you do have trouble losing weight, then tell yourself that! It’s not your fault if you can’t help it, and it’s not your fault if you fall a few times — because you can certainly get back up and try again. The only time someone becomes a loser is when they give up.

4) Don’t be intimidated by other people who fit into those “ideals” — and don’t compare yourself to them, because comparing yourself to people who you’re nothing like will not help the situation and will only make you accept the stigma — but we’re not doing that, we’re challenging the stigma! Don’t lose focus of your ultimate goal.

5) Don’t have the intention to be like others, because you are you. Simple as that, no one can be like you and you can’t be like them, so take a deep breath and accept that you are simply you. You were not created to be like others, and understand that individuality is needed in the world! Life would be a bit boring if we were all the same shape, shade and size — especially in one culture.

6) Understand that you can be the generation or the change within your generation. Why shouldn’t you be the change in society that you are to yourself? Just because everyone else accepts and thinks the same thing (chances are they don’t) doesn’t mean you should follow like a sheep. Be the growth of modern and new ideas to push out the stigma. The elder generation are still dipped into traditional ways of thinking — but in order to break that chain, it has to be broken somewhere, right? That can be you.

7) Put Islamic thought before cultural thought. Understand and see what Islam says about weight and healthiness rather than sticking to what unrealistic traditions suggest because unlike culture, Islamic sayings are beneficial, actually have some substance, and will probably motivate you more. Allah knows what is best for you, not aunties.

8) Know that culture does not define you! Your faith, your confidence, your nature, YOU are what defines you, so don’t look for definition of identity or appearance through something that has no grip over you, look towards what you already have and what you are really working for. Once you know and understand what truthfully defines you, the more sooner you can start working on yourself to make that definition better!

9) Show that you are confident with who and what you are, even if you’re not, because once people see that “different” people are actually okay with the way they are, then they will in turn start being okay with it. When conversations crop up about ideals and weight, or if somebody makes a comment — reach the inner you and express your thoughts and opinions. If nobody is given a different perspective, then what else are they supposed to think other than what they have been taught?

10) FYI — it’s okay to be curvy and toned, you don’t have to be super slim to be healthy! Remember, be the change, don’t accept the stigma, challenge it, accept who and what you are, understand that no one has the right to tell you what you should fit into, and lastly, you got this!",https://medium.com/inspirited-minds/why-can-t-you-lose-weight-part-2-2ba3b1c79667,['Inspirited Minds'],2015-12-07 21:56:08.909000+00:00,"['Islam', 'Weight Loss', 'Health']"

Manufacturing Happiness,"Uber Taxi, Gojek, Grab Bike, Grab Taxi and some other business in transportation section today, in which I am really sure that there will be more coming in the near future. Aside from the controversies, there are a lot of good and heartwarming stories from them, especially when it comes to the drivers’ welfare.

I won’t talk about the business, money making system, or whatnots. I am sure there are a lot of you who already talked about it, and I bet your understanding about that is thousand times better than me. Hehe.

I am one of the regular customer of them, both Gojek and Uber, because they really help me in my daily routine. Before Gojek, to ride an ojek is so troublesome, not only that I had to bargain to decide the price, I also had to point out the ways to get me to my destination. This also happened when riding a Taxi. Those are exactly why I totally go for Gojek and Uber Taxi.

For you who experienced Gojek/Uber services, you must be well aware about the rating feature in the app, right? Not only giving 1–5 rating for the drivers, there is an option to give comments about the driver, in which this seems to be forgotten by many.

It all started just for fun. After using their services, I gave my rating and adding some short comments, such as: “The Driver is good”. Until then my comments get longer and longer and it becomes my habit.

Here are some of my comments that I captured.

Why do I bother to do that? Here’s the things. The first one is because I have time and thus I am able to do that. The second reason is because appreciation is something people tend to forgot, yet this simple thing could change one’s mood all day. The effort for me to do that is perhaps less than 2 minutes, yet it can put smiles on those drivers’ faces and give them extra energy to go through their day. Like a random act of kindness, just it is not so random for we know what they really do to help us.

I sometimes captured my comments for the drivers, and shared them on my social media accounts. Not to show off or something, ew no. I shared them just because I thought it is fun to do and if it makes my friend do the same then why not? Spend your two minutes for being honest, expressing gratitude, and appreciate what others do for you through short commentaries.

If you asked me “Do they even read the comments?”, I think I had to laugh it out. Because back when I started leaving comments, I don’t have the idea whether they would read it or not. But after asking few drivers about it, it appears that they are actually really reading the comments that we left for them.

Also because of this, some of you may wonder if I am one of Gojek/Uber’s marketing stunts. Nope, I wish, though. But no. I am purely doing it for fun and just want to manufacture happiness in a world full of grief.

I always believe that there are things that may look like they matter none for us, but they could be meaningful for others. If it’s not a big deal for us, that doesn’t mean it won’t matter for others, right? :)

Interested to spend your two minutes to manufacture a little happiness? #MariBahagiakanDriver.

And here are some of captures that my friends sent me. Thank you guys!

The Importance of Balance,"Master Hua-Ching Ni is a different I Ching scholar in the sense that he not only provides the usual introduction to each of the sixty-four hexagrams of the I Ching, and the explanation for each line, but in addition, a more or less extensive comment at the end of each hexagram. These comments are very precious material not only for the I Ching scholar and student but also for those interested in integral philosophy and the unique Taoist teaching of spiritual sufficiency.

This is the comment to Hexagram 2 which symbolizes the receptive force, pure yin energy—six broken lines. Master Ni entitled his comment The Balance of Life : Integrating the T’ai Chi. This comment is one of the most substantial in the book.

Balance is a very fundamental, essential concept in integral spirituality. I tend to argue there are only two of those very essential concepts, it’s the existence of chi and the concept of balance. Without balance, any life will be fragmented and residual. A full life is not possible without balance, as when we breathe, our diaphragm moves up and down. If our diaphragm was stiff, a piece of steel, breathing would not be possible. Hence life would not be possible as life is essentially breath. Chi is breath. The Romans called it pneuma. As it is with breathing, so it is with life as a whole. If it doesn’t move up and down, if it doesn’t flow, and circulate, it’s stuck; then it doesn’t really live and expand in its continual evolution.

Hence there must be a balance between this up and down movement, there must be a balance between expansion and contraction, a balance between hot and cold, right and left, moving forward and backward, or standing still. As I have myself found through the study of the patterns of living in the I Ching, the I Ching recommends the sage not only one way of action, but three different ways to move, namely forward, backward and standing still. While modern society only knows moving forward as evolution, the I Ching recognizes that while moving backward or standing still, one may well get ahead in one’s evolution, and if it’s not on the material plane, then certainly on the spiritual. Without balance this whole system would crash, it would deliver no results, as a man flying to the moon to take some samples of moon dust. In such a linear action there is hardly any gain. Every plain and full action is not linear but nonlinear as all growth in nature is nonlinear. With this in mind, let us read the following quote:

Hua-Ching Ni

In the previous hexagram, Chyan, the universal first nature is discussed. The recognizable trace of the universal nature can be sensed as the qualities, persistence, forwardness, creativity, productivity and positivity. It symbolizes masculinity and fatherhood. The hexagram K’un means to accomplish, continue, receive, follow, realize, formalize, shape and stabilize. It symbolizes feminity and motherhood, and expresses the self-balancing nature of the universe. Self-balancing means harmonizing with all beings and things that are brought forth. Hands are a good example of how Chyan and K’un express themselves in the human body. Gentleness is expressed by the soft left hand, while strength is expressed by the strong right hand. Developed people value the left hand; undeveloped people value the right hand. Actually, both hands assist each other in the practical sphere of daily life. This example also relates to the yin/yang principle and the natural physiology of the left and right sides of the brain and their different functions. Generally, the left side of the brain controls the sequential processes of logic, analysis, rational and scientific behavior, the right side of the body and the special processes of intuition, creativity and dreaming. A dominance of either side of the brain is apparent by observing the behavior and actions of an individual or nation. ‘Military aggression’ can be associated with the overly dominant left side of the brain and ‘the strong right’. Since consideration and sensitivity are associated with the right side of the brain, it is easy to see how ‘gentle people value the soft left hand’. The Universal Way leads to the balance and cooperation of both hemispheres of the brain: ‘Use upright measures to govern the country, use a surprising approach to win the battle. To lead the world, do not interfere with or otherwise disturb people.’ / These ancient discoveries have been accurately utilized in natural diagnosis and acupuncture practice since the Stone Age. Right and left side brain controls are of utmost importance in acupuncture treatment. For example, in the case of someone who has become paralyzed or twisted, acupuncture needles would be applied to the side opposite that of the paralyzed side. Pulse diagnosis in natural healing uses the different functions of the left and right sides of the brain which influence pulsation, thereby yielding the secrets of the body. The most accurate time for reading the pulse is early morning, before any mental or physical activity has had a chance to disturb or change the pulse rate. In ancient times, some achieved ones also used pulse reading as the basis for telling a person’s fortune and predicting what would happen in the near or distant future. They knew that the development of both sides of a person’s brain divulged the secrets and decisive factors of one’s life. This same principle is also applied in palm reading, where the lines of the palm tell the secrets of the brain and thus the influences of one’s life. When one’s customary patterns of life change, the lines of the palm change accordingly. Ancient integral cultural development was based on a natural balance between the right and left sides of the human brain. Today that balance has obviously been lost. The modern ‘right-hand’ culture of logic is accepted, while the ancient ‘left-hand’ intuitive cultural achievement is mistakenly rejected. On a more mystical level, the natural evolution of the human race in both the eastern and western hemispheres can be observed. Their tendencies and habits are interestingly contrasted with each other. Since Earth is shaped like the brain, the different developments of the east and west sides of the globe should also serve each other in beneficial ways. However, it appears that the left side of the brain is overused in today’s society. The T’ai Chi symbol expresses complete balance of both sides. It resembles the brain, with even right and left halves, and the globe of the earth, with balanced eastern and western hemispheres. This symbol of balance, development and integration can be applied to all things and all events. Spiritually, the left hand expresses harmony in the world as well as in human cultures. Earth is not only a mixture of soil, rocks and minerals, but also a vast living organism. It / is a life. When people abuse the Earth, this behavior becomes suicidal for the entire human race. Damage to one’s integrity may also be caused by specialization. A well-trained athlete takes a long time to excel at his or her special event. One may be good at javelin throwing, hammer throwing, discus throwing, and so forth: however, the result of this type of special training generally makes the arm and leg of one side thicker than the arm and leg of the other side. In some situations, the same imbalance can seriously influence one’s brain, organs, personality and total health. People who train with iron-made devices and use machines for building their muscles will probably experience a mechanical reaction to their personalities, due to the lack of naturalness and flexibility of their bodies and minds. Not only do physical training and sports produce unnatural results, but much learning, specific training and some professions also produce adverse effects. These effects often limit one’s capabilities and interaction with others. Specialists often see only the trees without seeing the forest. In order to achieve harmony, it is necessary to balance and integrate yin and yang as one unit. This balance is the subtle yet sustaining power of the universe. Every positive manifestation in the universe comes forth as the result of the creative, harmonious union of yin and yang energies, and each manifestation has its own unique energy arrangement and pattern of movement. Following the inherent order of the universe results in harmony and balance. Opposing the principle of natural order causes destruction. Anything that is one-sided is incomplete. Balance can also be illustrated by the operation of the T’ai Chi principle. T’ai Chi is universal movement, a continual sequence of yin and yang movements. That is how T’ai Chi Chuan originated as a form of spiritual cultivation. Thus, all movement, as an expression of yin and yang, should be balanced. Nothing should be excessive. If there is upward movement there should be downward movement. If there is movement to the right, there must also be movement to the left. Inhalation and exhalation should also be coordinated to maintain balance. One should integrate the principles of T’ai Chi into one’s own life. By understanding all movement, one will be able to lead a balanced, integrated life. /229-231

Glossary

* I Ching or Book of Changes is the oldest of the Chinese classic texts. A symbol system designed to identify order in what appear to be chance events, it describes an ancient system of cosmology and philosophy that is at the heart of Chinese cultural beliefs. It is based on the alternation of complementary energies called yin and yang, which are developmental poles that by their alternation trigger inevitable change. It is also based on the old integrative philosophy of the five elements that is part of many other esoteric science traditions. The philosophy centers on the ideas of the dynamic balance of opposites, the evolution of events as a process, and acceptance of the inevitability of change.

The I Ching consists of 64 hexagrams. Each hexagram or kua is an energy pattern that is a unique mix of the two base energies, yin and yang, represented symbolically by lines. Yang is represented by a solid line, yin by a dotted line. Each hexagram is composed of six lines, and two trigrams consisting of three lines each. The lower trigram deals with matters that are in their beginning stage, from the start of a project until about half of its realization. The upper trigram deals with the culmination and the end of processes or projects, positively or negatively.

The I Ching has been a book for divination and relief, and for spiritual learning for many great and famous people such as Confucius, Hermann Hesse, John Lennon, Carl Gustav Jung, and many others. I personally consult the I Ching on a regular basis since 1990.

Will UI Designers be Unemployed Soon? (and other UX links this week),"What’s hot in UX this week:

When the first iPhone came out in 2007, the demand for UI designers skyrocketed. Every team needed someone to design the hottest skeuomorphic apps. Plenty of conversations probably revolved around creating a realistic wooden bookshelf to make a certain app look just like real furniture.

But as years passed and the world grew flatter and simpler, it became very clear — all the designer needs to do is to follow the rules. And the rules are very simple:

• Live by the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

• Stick to the brand guidelines

• Make sure not to screw up the UX

Got all of these right? Great job! You can work as a UI designer in a top tech company in the Valley, and earn plenty of money.

Stay Focused. 5 Hands on Strategies to Escape the Office Madness and Become More Productive,"I am a focus fatalist. I love being productive in terms of creating things. I love to get stuff done and I believe that focussing on the essentials is one of the most important habits of an entrepreneur. But even if you are really good in organizing stuff and working long hours it does not mean that you get your important things done. We are distracted by many annoying things that keep us from working on our projects. Instead of pushing our new business idea we get stuck in checking e-mails, updating our facebook status, surfing on the Internet or attending some useless meeting with colleagues. Afterwards we wonder how other entrepreneurs are able to create new ventures in just a few days or weeks. The secret is to stay focused. Even if everyone around you tries to distract you.

The seduction of distraction is hard to beat, but there are a few strategies. During the last years I collected ideas from other entrepreneurs and my own experience for being more productive. Here are 5 hands on strategies:

1. Plan the big blocks of the week

Imagine the week is an empty glass and you need to fill it with all your work: big ice blocks, crushed ice and water. What would be the best order to fill up your glass? If you start with the water the added big blocks will let the glass overflow immidiately. The obvious trick is to start with the big blocks, than add the crushed ice, which fits into the holes between the big blocks and in the end you top it up with water. The same applies to our work. If you start with all the small tasks on Monday, you will run out of time for your big tasks and end up pretty stressed on Friday. So, first plan your big ice blocks and start with them right away, everything else comes later.

2. Kill all distractors around you

It is the daily fight against “Darth Distraction“. The moment you switch on your computer you are already sucked in by many options to interrupt your tasks and do something else you actually wanted to. It is the Skype autostart window that tells you that a friend still needs an answer. 20 browser windows with text that you still want to read. 50 unread e-mails that need a reply. etc. The simple trick is the one window policy. By using a simple program like the Text Editor to work on a text or a concept you can avoid all distracting tools: No formatting, no Internet, just typing. For anyone with a really bad Internet addiction I strongly recommend the StayFocusd app. This funny program blocks the Internet connection for the time you really need to focus.

3. Start with a routine

I used to start my day with getting up shortly before I needed to leave home and hurry to the office. I think many people do so. A couple of years ago I figured out, that the morning is the only time of the day that no one can take away from you. Since then I try to get up early, have a relaxing breakfast, read the news and start with one easy task (but no e-mails!). This is my morning routine that really helps me starting the day with a clear mind. Surplus it always puts me in a good mood to rock the challenges of the day.

4. Learn to swim

There is so much information out there that makes us almost drowning every day. Not only hundreds of e-mails but also news, calls, reports, project updates etc. Take a look at Facebook: The world literally never sleeps. We need to accept that this information flood will grow stronger every day and we will never be able to stop it, since we are not the Hoover Dam. But we can learn to swim with the flow if we understand, that we do not need to know everything. We do not need to see every e-mail that employees are writing in carbon copy. And we do not need every detail on project reports. Some of the most efficient entrepreneurs in the world prefer the phone instead of e-mail because they can focus on the few very important calls instead of reading all the useless FYI e-mails.

5. Rock your day like Rockefeller

Rockefeller, one of the most successful entrepreneurs in history, used to focus his work by using the Top 5 method. His lists of projects were so extensive, that he could never finish his projects. Every night before going to bed, Rockefeller checked his task lists and decided which Top 5 tasks were the most important ones for the next day. He than wrote them down on a piece of paper that he could take with him the next morning, in order not to get caught by every day distractions. A very simple but very powerful method that doubles productivity in almost no time. Instead of starting with e-mails, I do the Top 5 and decide that way what to do first (this also means that no employee or business partner can rule my day). Like Rockefeller, if there is a distraction, I take out my Zencover notebook and check my Top 5 to get back on track.

Thanks for reading all the way! If you like what you read you can follow me on Twitter. I’m founder and partner of Blackboat and on a mission to create the#futureofwork.

What is Your Design Philosophy?,"What is your design philosophy? — I was asked this question by a candidate during a recent job interview. Oddly, it was the first time I’d ever been asked that question. As I fumbled through an answer I realized I didn’t really have an articulated design philosophy, or at least not one that easily came to mind. So I decided remedy that.

1: There is art in design, but design is not art

There is a practiced art to creating great design, but the final output of the design process is not art. Art is creative expression intended to provoke questions and individual interpretation. Art is inspiring, emotional and important, but does not fill a specific need beyond humanities’ desire to express itself. Design, on the other hand, is a creative process intended to solve a problem, to fill a need for the people that will ultimately interact with it. Design should not be open to interpretation, but instead should define how it is to be engaged with and should guide a user at each stage of that engagement. Art creates questions, design creates answers.

2: Design must be rooted in reality

As Dieter Rams says, “Indifference towards people and the reality in which they live is actually the one and only cardinal sin in design”. Empathy is the conduit to great design and the critical skill for great designers. Without a deep understanding of the end user and the reality in which a design will be used, any decision a designer makes is a shot in the dark. To fill a real need, design must be rooted in reality.

3: Design is never perfect

Design is about creating elegant solutions to address user needs. The tricky thing is that most often we are designing for humans, and humans are complicated. People’s expectations and desires evolve over time. Sometimes design evolves to meet these changes, sometimes design is the driver of the change. Regardless, a designer’s work is never done. This does not mean that design needs to be trendy, design can be timeless, but a great designer has a bent toward iteration and always has their ear to the ground.

4: Design is a set of tools, not a standardized process

Every problem presents its own unique set of characteristics, as such there is no one-size-fits-all process for coming to the best solution. The art of design is about having a diverse set of tools and approaches, and determining when to apply each. To quote Maslow, “…it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail” — so always carry a hammer, a screw driver, a pair of pliers and a hex wrench.

5: Design communicates obvious function

For something to be “well designed” it could be simple, or it could be complex. It could be considered aesthetically pleasing, or it could be considered gaudy. Aesthetics and simplicity are not requirements. For something to be well designed, the key requirement is that its function must be obvious. A person should be able to easily determine how to use and interact with it.

6: Design should delight

A design should create moments of delight for the people who encounter it. There is no steadfast rule as to what is delightful. Delight can come in different forms for different people, this is where empathy comes in, but most likely it is a mix of form, function and value that creates that often intangible emotional connection to a well designed thing.",https://hairyelefante.medium.com/what-is-your-design-philosophy-a32d43985899,['Jesse Weaver'],2015-12-31 05:00:51.637000+00:00,"['Design Thinking', 'UX', 'Design']"
"We need more video, but why?","Non-profits, foundations and public sector agencies are incorporating more video into their outreach campaigns, fundraising, storytelling and reporting with applications like Vine, Periscope, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook. By 2018, an estimated 79% of all Internet traffic will be video! (CISCO)

In this kind of landscape, how can you make sure your organization stands out? How can you make sure your content will be noticed above the barrage of digital media?

We researched what’s happening with video content now and how people process and interpret it to understand why it’s so important.

The first few seconds are critical. According to The Guardian’s article, “Is Online Video the Savior of Fragmented Digital Marketing”, Google finds people who skip videos still remember the advertisement, and that people who watch less than three seconds make up almost 50% of the return for advertisers. This means the few first seconds they do see matter most.

Your brain on storytelling. We believe in quality content, not just a video for video’s sake. Audiences do too. Content with a clear narrative and story that elicits an emotive response is most effective.

Stories are better processed than statistics because of this reason, and though some may see stories as a distraction, stories in themselves make us focus — they catch a wandering mind’s attention. Jonathan Gottschall, author of The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make us Human, describes how this is done because of our physiological make-up: we feel and experience what goes on in the story because of our brain’s mimicking abilities.

Looking at the brain’s neuroscience under a FMRI machine while telling a story, the brain will unconsciously interpret a story as if it was happening in real life — even if you know it isn’t real. This explains how we can feel during a sad moment, and how our heart races during a horrifying one.

Your brain on storytelling through video. Video combines narrative and visuals to deliver a double-whammy. The brain processes images 60 times faster than words! (OneSpot)

Neomam Studio’s infograph shows we are made to process visual information because 50% of our brain is involved in visual processing and 70% of our visual sensory receptors are in our eyes. Not only are we designed to efficiently process the visual components of video, but also, we are quite receptive to features unique to video. According to psychologist Susan Weinschenk, there are four key reasons why video is compelling: our brain’s wiring makes the sound of the human voice, the sight of the human face, emotional cues, and movement very attractive to us.

Video’s ability to concisely combine visual imagery, storytelling, human emotions and our own physiological responses to these triggers, makes it one of the most powerful mediums out there.

You’ve Got An Excuse For Not Funding Women Startups? I Call BS.,"Hit the button at the bottom of the page that says “Write your response”, and tell us what you’ve heard/experienced, re: women surviving in the tech sector.

Why don’t we have more women in tech? Why does a mere 7% of investor money go to women-led startups? Why are women programmers afraid they’ll be looked over in the job sector?

I've heard the rebuttals and the devil’s advocates, but trust me, I've got counters:

There just aren't as many women-led startups as there are startups led by men! I call BS.

Women are founding startups every single day. There was a 68% increase in women launching businesses in the US between 1997 and 2014. That is TWO TIMES the growth rate of businesses owned by men in that same time frame.

Women-led startups just aren't viable. They’re just not as good at what they do. BS, again.

Women-led tech startups have a 35% higher ROI when venture backed and generate 12% higher revenue than male-run startups. Women entrepreneurs bring in 20% more revenue than entrepreneurs who are men, with 50% less money invested.

Women don’t effectively pitch their startups. Nope — people just pay more attention to startups founded by men. It’s proven. MIT conducted a field study where they concluded that:

Across a field setting (three entrepreneurial pitch competitions in the United States) and two controlled experiments, we find that investors prefer entrepreneurial pitches presented by male entrepreneurs compared with pitches presented by female entrepreneurs, even when the content of the pitch is the same.

Need more proof? MIT isn’t enough? No problem, Yale conducted a similar study proving that the gender-bias in science is real.

Research from Yale that had scientists presented with application materials from a student applying for a lab manager position and who intended to go on to graduate school. Half the scientists were given the application with a male name attached, and half were given the exact same application with a female name attached. Results found that the “female” applicants were rated significantly lower than the “males” in competence, hireability, and whether the scientist would be willing to mentor the student.

Oh, wait. Still not convinced? How about the study published by the Innovative Higher Education Journal?

Assistant instructors in an online class each operated under two different gender identities. Students rated the male identity significantly higher than the female identity, regardless of the instructor’s actual gender, demonstrating gender bias. Given the vital role that student ratings play in academic career trajectories, this finding warrants considerable attention.

The gender bias is real. And we need to step up and acknowledge that. This means making a concerted effort to fund. women-led. startups. Period. These terrible stats keep perpetuating, and they aren’t going to change unless we do something. And it has to be intentional.

Women Who Tech just launched the first-ever Women Startup Challenge to fund women-led startups. They’re giving $50,000 cash to women-led startups, no strings attached. Seriously. Apply here. Or, if you don’t have a startup, share it with a friend who’s been working to get her startup off the ground.

You can also learn how to rock your pitch, how to navigate the BS brogrammer culture, and more during the Women Who Tech TeleSummit happening on April 29. Register for the TeleSummit to secure your spot.

Day 5: Life Lessons

A faithful friend and reader, sincerely wished my posts would have more defined beginnings, middles and ends. And as I read his words I remembered Sarah Kay quoting Jean Luc-Goddard, saying every story has a beginning, a middle and an end. But not necessarily in that order.

So, I’ve already given you the end it’s in the title.

I am learning not to judge.

Here’s the middle! And hopefully the beginning will find itself in the end.

I’m going to try to narrate the story of the girl in the picture photographing her freshly pedicured feet and then I’m going to tell you about the day I photographed my freshly pedicured feet.

There’s a difference. One is the story I would have read (ok, read as read) of a picture like that. The other is my story.

It must be a lazy Saturday. An idle mind is definitely the Devils workshop – prompts the dumb blonde to take a picture of her feet. She must either be really silly or really vain. The kind that believes winning a beauty crown is one step closer to world peace. Beauty and brains definitely can’t coexist.

It was a lazy Saturday and maybe even an idle one. It was my closest friend’s birthday and her fiancé had planned the celebrations from across the sea. It included my pedicure! It was an incredibly special day for two reasons – it came in the middle of a really stressful work life. And the fact that the new guy in the scene understood our friendship.

That picture to me is so much more than pretty feet – it’s encouragement, friendship and comfort and even well laid birthday plans. But it’s also an epiphany.

Every time I have judged a trope I have come to be it.

I tell people I dislike my name cause it doesn’t personify me. Belinda brings up a the picture of a blonde cheerleader (who takes pictures of her feet and posts it on social media) in my head.

A head that’s obviously been fed one too many tropes. A head that believes its too cool to be a blonde cheerleader.

But also a head that doesn’t want to be put into a box anymore.

Because the story isn’t in the five hundred words the picture is worth – it’s behind and beyond the picture.",https://medium.com/the-writers-thing/do-not-judge-e9eaa6c288a1,['Belinda Peter'],2015-10-24 16:22:21.254000+00:00,"['Epiphany', 'Storytelling', 'Stereotypes']"
Top 6 Things To Do To Help Wake Up For Fajr The Blessed Hub,"Imam Malik relates that he heard from Nafi’ who heard from Ibn ‘Umar that ‘Umar b. al-Khattab (r) wrote to all of his governors saying, “The most important of your affairs in my view is the prayer. Whoever protects it and observes it carefully is protecting his religion, while whoever is negligent about it will be even more negligent about other things.”

Make sure you have learnt the form of prayer — learning from one who is licensed to teach Fiqh

Acquiring knowledge of the aspects of the prayer is highly important, “sacred knowledge is the essence of religion” said Ibn Sirin. So “learn! for learning is an adornment for the one who possesses it, a virtue and a prelude to every praiseworthy action…the knowledge of Fiqh (jurisprudence) is the best guide to piety and the fear of God, and it is the straightest path to the ultimate goal.” (Imam Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani).

Learn the importance of purity and be vigilant of it

Always be vigilant of Wudu’ and Ghusl and avoid impurities. This is also part and parcel of studying the Fiqh of prayer. Try to remain in a state of Wudu’ as much as possible. Make Wudu’ when you wake up and when you go to sleep.

Always be humble — learn the path of Tasawwuf or Ihsan (the path of excellence)

Imam Malik relates, “Whoever keeps tasawwuf without fiqh will be corrupted and who keeps fiqh without tasawwuf will transgress and whoever keeps fiqh and tasawwuf will reach (the Truth) reality.”

When the Beloved Prophet (s) was asked about Ihsan by the Arcangel Jibril (s), he said it is “That you worship Allah as if you see Him, for if you don’t see Him then truly He sees you.” So the concern here is to work on yourself, work on your heart, and work on your priorities. Alawys be humble, as the great scholar, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Akhdari (r) says:

The prayer contains a vast spiritual light that radiates in the hearts of those who truly pray, but it is only obtainable by one who has humbly submitted himself. Thus, should you come to prayer, empty your heart of the ephemeral world and what it contains, and occupy yourself with vigilant awareness of your Master for whose sake you are praying.

Learn to guard your tongue, eyes, ears, stomach, private parts and your feet. Work on your bad traits. All of this is the path of Ihsan. Tread well, and you will find reading prayer a lot easier.

Waking up for Fajr

Allow for a 40 day plan

It is known to be true that to create a habit you should do that thing for 30–40 days continually. Make a plan that for 40 days you will pray Fajr (do not exclude all the other prayers). If you fail, start again — e.g. if you miss a prayer or if you do not pray on time. This will take time but it’s a struggle that will reap many rewards.

You could even give yourself a penalty, each time you miss one, spend in charity or fast for example.

If the 40 day plan cannot work out — take small consistent steps

“The most beloved of deeds to Allah are the most consistent of them, even if they are few” | The Beloved Prophet (s)

Try to read Fajr once a week at first, once you’ve done that, increase it to 2, then increase likewise increasing by one until you reach the point where you’re reading every day.

Change old habits — food and sleep

There are habitual things that can be changed much more easily as compared to others they are — eating and sleeping. Both of these are related. Do not over sleep, sleep up to 7–8 hours. Do not over-eat, do not eat before going to sleep and watch your diet! eat healthily. Go to sleep as early as possible and try to stick to a set routine.

Create a Fajr Buddy

This can either be someone from the family, someone amongst your friends or even someone far closer to you — your alarm clock!! With alarms, keep them away at a distance, get up saying Subhan’Allah, make Wudu’ and read.

Don’t ask ‘How can I get up for Fajr?’ but ask ‘Why don’t I get up?’

Try it. If you think about why you don’t get up, you will find a solution in most cases of how to get up. People tend to forget they know why they don’t get up — just address that issue and see what happens.

The best advice — ask God to help you

Really! If you’re in any difficulty, be it getting up for Fajr or continually sinning. There is no better way to remove the problem. Ask Allah to help you as there is no greater helper and power then He, the Most High.

Big stakes in small Sri Lanka for China and India,"By Feizal Samath

You might think Sri Lanka would be small change for Asia’s two powerhouses.

But maneuvering by China and India underscores the strategic importance both attach to the island nation.

Called Ceylon in English until 1972, Sri Lanka occupies a strategic location in the Indian Ocean that since the 17th century has attracted Portuguese, Dutch, French, British and finally Indian traders.

Now China is investing in a big way and flexing its military muscles as the Asian giant extends its influence beyond its borders.

Sri Lanka, located just off India’s southeastern tip, sits on major sea lanes and has one of the world’s finest harbors in its eastern seaport of Trincomalee.

It owes close relations with India to more than geography. Sri Lanka’s majority community, the Sinhalese, came from northern India while minority Tamils came mainly from Tamil Nadu state in southern India.

India’s key role

India was home to Gautama Buddha, spiritual leader of millions of Buddhists in Sri Lanka.

India played a crucial role in Sri Lanka’s 26-year civil war, which ended six years ago and pitted Tamil separatist rebels against Sri Lankan government forces. India was keen to establish itself as a regional power and also feared a separatist revolt by its own Tamils.

In the early years of the insurgency that started in 1983, India allowed Tamil rebels from Sri Lanka to operate training camps in south India, and India sent a peacekeeping force to its maritime neighbor.

In 1987, then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi tried to broker an end to fighting. When the rebels pulled out of the pact, Indian troops turned their guns on them.

In 1991, the rebels exacted vengeance: A female cadre set off a bomb strapped to her waist as she greeted Gandhi at a campaign rally in Tamil Nadu, killing him instantly.

China stepped into the breach, offering the Sri Lankan government military support in its fight against the rebels.

Jostling reaches new heights

When the insurgency ended in 2009, then Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa invited the Chinese to develop massive infrastructure facilities including a second international airport, an expressway connecting the capital city to the country’s main airport and a new seaport.

These would not be China’s first deals in Sri Lanka. In 1952, to the annoyance of the West, Sri Lanka signed a rubber-for-rice barter deal with China that lasted for three decades.

More recently, China backed Sri Lanka in the face of U.S.-sponsored resolutions against Colombo at the U.N. Human Rights Council — resolutions that were supported by India.

Now, jostling between China and India has reached new heights.

Delicate balancing act

Last November, two Chinese submarines and a warship docked at Colombo harbor, prompting a protest by India, which said the warships had violated a 1987 peace accord between Delhi and its southeastern maritime neighbor.

More recently, Sri Lanka’s new president, Maithripala Sirisena, who ousted Rajapaksa in elections in January, suspended a mega port city development project by a Chinese government-backed company, citing allegations that it lacked proper approvals.

Environmentalists and civil society groups oppose the project, saying that reclaiming 575 acres of water front would harm the environment and sea life.

Most analysts expect the project to win eventual approval. But its suspension underscores the high stakes at play as Sri Lanka balances the interests of the two Asian powers.

This year, Chinese tourists are set to become the second largest contingent of visitors after Indians. Like it or not, Sri Lanka depends on both India and China.

The government risks losing votes ahead of parliamentary elections in June if it pushes through the Chinese-backed project. But that could be the price to pay as Sri Lanka walks a diplomatic tightrope between India and China.

Some Things Never Change,"May 4th, 2014

A Story Each Day

Some things never change. He used to find comfort in that idea. Having something solidify his life with permanence gave him a feeling of control (or at least the illusion of it) that never seemed to last for very long.

He walked into the church and heard the same songs from two years ago ringing through the overly ambitious ceiling architecture. He quickly filed into a seat, making friendly nods to the standing churchgoers as they glanced his way. Everyone looked the same, with the same contented expressions masking their faces, as if none of them had left since he was there two years before. The pastor stood at the front, wearing what looked like the same shirt and tie that he wore two years ago.

The worship ended and the same two-year-old piano music drifted through the air as one of the pastors opened the service in prayer, with the same words that he’d used two years ago.

As the service continued and the sermon began, his mind wandered, the way it did two years ago before he’d left. It always wandered during church. He wondered if that meant something was wrong with him, or something was wrong with the church. He guessed that it was something wrong with him, but he wasn’t concerned enough to consider it for very long.

The service ended and the crowd dispersed. An older couple sitting in front of him turned and smiled a friendly southern Christian smile, the kind that he’d actually missed a little in Los Angeles.

“Hello, there. How are you?”

“Uh, good. I’m good — How are you?”

“Oh, we’re doin’ great. Are you new here?”

“Yeah. I mean, sort of. I mean, no, actually.”

“Oh?”

“Well, I went to school here. In Roanoke, I mean- but I moved to LA last summer, and just moved back last week.”

“Oh, that’s great. We have a niece who is in LA. She’s doing acting. She really…”

The couple continued talking, but his mind started to wander, just like during the sermon. He wondered again if something was wrong with him, or wrong with them. He guessed that it was him, but he wasn’t concerned enough to consider it for very long.

“-That reminds me, let me introduce you to Rachel — she’s good friends with our niece, and she knows a lot of kids your age.” The older man said. He turned and beckoned for him to follow them, toward a group of younger folks his age.

Rachel?

He scanned the crowd, quickly.

“Oh, I actually should be going, I’ve got to-“

Rachel turned and locked her subtly disheartening eyes with his.

“Ben. What are you doing here?”

“Oh, you two know each other?” The older fellow chuckled, “Well, isn’t that great? I’ll leave you two to catch up. Great to meet you, Ben!”

He extended his hand.

“We’re glad you’re back from LA!” The older woman added. They shuffled off through the crowd of cheery churchgoers, leaving him caught in an obdurate situation.

Silence like the pause before a prayer stunted his words, but not hers.

“So. How was LA?”

“Good.”

“When did you move back?”

“A week and a half ago.”

His mind wandered to the last they saw each other, when she’d begged him to make out. His mind quickly raced away from the discomforting reflection, but wondered again if something was wrong with him because of his wandering mind.

A smile-ridden hunk bumped into their conversation and put his arm around her. She smiled coyly and rested her head on his shoulder, affectionately. He extended his hand and introduced himself with a booming voice that would’ve only fit on a football field or a weightlifting gym.

“Travis. Good to meet you.”

“Ben.”

He turned back to her and smiled.

“We’re headed to lunch, you ready to go?”

“Uh huh.” She nodded and smiled.

She took his hand and led him away, with the same seductive and manipulative smile that he’d seen a year before. She turned back.

“Good to see you again.”

“You too,” he lied. His mind wandered to the first time he met her, when they went to lunch right after church. The same smile on her face. The same curl of her lips. The same playfulness in her eyes.

"Robin Williams’ First Suicide Note, circa 1987","Weather report: partly cloudy with a slight chance of dying.

You see, nobody’s been in the business of writing me love letters for quite some time, now. And the clowns? Don’t you worry about that; they’re already here, of course. It’s all a real jiffy, a cantankerous moan consumed with attention-getting, this taking of time, these paltry gesticulations of a showboating ham, this haircut (or lack of one) that passes for a man. Sorry. I have trouble with beginnings — a born malingerer.

Last things last. Or some that won’t. Accident prone as ever. My nerve’s shot. Relapse on the horizon. The gritty scuffle of making do with less. In a daytime-TV trance, I bark orders at crossing guards and run for cover, confused and bookish beneath the junipers. A rufous-sided towhee takes a dump close to my shoes. I feel blessed for the first time in years. Nothing nearby left to depend on except this bowdlerized excuse for being me.

Capsized in guttural mumbling, songs that won’t sing. Grow beard grow, wherever you may chance to go. Arrested in my overcoat. Take me away. Take me away from reruns and alarm clocks. Splink about it all. Make up words and sense. Put your suit on backwards. Yes, Na-Nu fucking Na-Nu and all of it. Nothing’s timely here. Flying beyond all Orks for a career change, perhaps a priest at long last, or a dog walker, or a watercolor specialist with a penchant for heliotrope. I am not a man built of fulfilled desire. Just something spawned of rainbow-suspendered unrest and less-than-holy gestures. Good motherfucking morning to it all. All of it. And all the rest too.

Listen. A morbidly obese lady wearing a tan curtain-like dress smiles at me. I am withdrawn. Her right deciduous maxillary lateral incisor is off-yellow and slightly bent inward. Look. I am smiling back. There is a fortune between us. Riches of loosely held awe. A pity that isn’t taken without a restive quality. A knack for being alone. The worry less than golden over lost sleep. We exchange pleasantries. Nothing short of a curtsy and a whiff of looted hay. We light out and roam through lost territories. There are needy moods in our most insignificant asides and glances. And our names are all that might live on without us to guide them. Desperation is a thinness to all weight that slithers by without thought. Yesterday I screamed, “Alaska!” at a meter maid. I am not handling anything well.

“Look at me!” I would plead with a lump aching my throat. Disperse the troops, or some replacement hurt to belie all tenderness. But nobody looks, and I am seen too much yet never noticed. Laughs seem gratuitous in this trackless cut of shadows so far from the spot’s mark. Pockets jangling with airplane bottles of booze, I scramble from blackout to blackout between bouts of sanitized sanity. It gets later here all the time: this is what happens to me when I’m alive. The shakes. The trembling moments between clatter-happy despair and showy decals of this hirsute botcher of all ideas. Everyone understands me better than I do.

The faulty spigot of my wherewithal gushes until it only drips. Entire weekdays lost. A more even upheaval I don’t get — unfashionably odd at all times. And who calls the shots? Whose action is it to call? But mine’s a ruffled sort of indispensability: that tawdry little shine on the seat of my conscience. So late in the game to ponder new strategies. The fight’s what the weak and competent never put up. At least I can relish the fact that I am neither. Believing in yourself is for the mutually funded backers of bad taste, the shirkers of boredom, the assuredly lenient mimes, the passive do-gooders of a mindset hardwired with humdrum tendencies and meager troubles: those who would rather be of the crowd that they are lost in than be ruined with selflessness and doubt. But my two cents is just a borderline drunk’s flapping of the lips, so don’t invest too much in it. I don’t.

After wandering around downtown all day, trying to keep from going insane on the outside, I found myself sitting on a curb attempting to find a button that had first fallen off my suit jacket and then — after I’d recovered it and placed it in my breast pocket — slipped through a hole in that pocket; and a guy in a white flannel suit came up to me and gave me some change.

So little ever returned on these slight and empty investments I keep making with imitations of my personality. A rawer deal I’ve never seen the likes of. All I get are reasons to quit, to take one final dive and go under into what’ll probably only be the mediocre beyond. I say let the Swedish Fish eat gummy worms.

I make lists of odd things. I am not sure why.

I’ve found myself spending preposterous amounts of time pondering the old joke about Grock again. The one where a desperately ill man goes to an analyst and tells him that he is seriously considering suicide. The analyst listens to his tale of melancholia and then tells the patient that what he needs is a good belly-laugh. He advises the unhappy man to go the circus that night and spend an evening laughing at Grock, the world’s funniest clown. The analyst sums it up, “After you have seen Grock, I am sure you will be much happier.” The patient rises to his feet, looks sadly at the doctor, turns and ambles towards the door. As he starts to leave the analyst says, “By the way, what is your name?” The man turns and regards the analyst with sorrowful eyes, “I am Grock.”

To wait and wait. Godot ain’t showing up, Little Shavers. I’m only here to wait, holding out (or maybe, on) to be some strangled and madcap version of me that I can never quite become. An 80-proof disaster on hydrangea-dashed currents. Lashing out on the inside. Rationed away, holed-up out in the open, in view of all.

Asphyxiation. It just moodily rolls off the tongue. Such a beautiful sound when bereft of its meaning. The absence of a pulse. A curious infelicity of etymology. A wonderful lack of all throbbing. An inept attempt at breath, a stifled choke, and then all vain motion stops. A noose’s sure grasp — something to be counted on, at last. Snapped, firm and real, gone, finally, so brittle, like all who breathe to live. Steady now. In the certainty of the drop, paced slower towards the finish’s indefatigable celerity.

I’ve got suspicions that there is much more to gain in what one gives than what one gets from all this. Something quite worthwhile, perhaps, to be done, to be known. Maybe a twig of joy artfully caught like a butterfly’s wing between pinkie and thumb. A stillness that doesn’t need to last because it just is. But it is not for me. I cannot know it, and there is only me here to do the knowing.

"Vitalik Buterin, Creator of Ethereum, Talks Bitcoin’s Most Ambitious Successor","Vitalik Buterin is a 20-year-old software developer and Thiel Fellow.

He has a breathtaking plan to build a future full of decentralized systems called distributed autonomous corporations, or DACs. It’s called Ethereum, maybe you have heard of it.

But what does that really mean?

Buterin recently took questions on ZapChain about Ethereum, and here’s what he said:

1. Ethereum Could Not Be Built on Bitcoin

The Ethereum project is a next-generation distributed platform.

Bitcoin is already worth billions in market capitalization, so Ethereum is being built from the ground-up as a Turing-complete language.

“Making changes to protocols always has risks. Making changes to a protocol with $3 billion in capital and a hundred thousand transactions per day has a lot of risks, and the core devs would not have allowed it anyway.”

Because bitcoin is already so large, Buterin believes Ethereum must be a standalone platform.

“Bitcoin works decently well as digital gold, but as far as payment protocols go I’m inclined to believe that existing systems will continue to be replaced by better and better technology, and the platform that wins will be the platform that manages to guarantee maximal agility to continued innovation.”

2. Bitcoin Has a Boring Future

“It makes me sleepy.”

In Buterin’s eyes, bitcoin’s long-term future is simply as a staid asset — like gold or stocks. Advancing a more decentralized economy and society is what motivates him — and Ethereum is part of that vision.

“I do still think that Bitcoin has a substantial chance of becoming a pure asset class for investment, and I still hold a lot of it for that reason, but that’s a rather boring future and not one whose social value I find all that exciting, and so my emotional investment goes toward general-purpose cryptoeconomic computing platforms.”

3. Ethereum Has a Big Team

Some members of the Ethereum team.

Team Ethereum has more people than most early-stage startups.

“[About] 30 full-time, salaries ranging between $45k and $190k, and a bunch more part-time.”

There are a lot of expectations the technology is going to be successful. Because of this, many team members are investing their income in ether, the native currency of Ethereum.

“Employees also got the ability to purchase ether up to a maximum of 20% of their salary at a price of 2000 ETH per BTC up until Mar 31; 3m ETH got distributed in this way.”

4. The Ethereum Client Will Look Like This

The Mist browser.

“The Ethereum client, Mist, is a fully featured ‘browser’ for decentralized web applications; you can use decentralized applications (‘dapps’) from inside of Mist just like you can interact with websites in a regular browser.”

5. The Future Needs Decentralization

Decentralized systems are an important part of technology.

Buterin calls things like authentication and identity foundational aspects of technology that should be decentralized.

“I think decentralization is particularly valuable for what I call “base layer” services: stuff that everything else relies on.”

An example is VoIP service Skype; once a big company acquired that service it became an increasingly centralized platform.

“Skype is ripe for decentralization because the original version was decentralized; but in ~2008 after Microsoft bought the company they added mandatory supernodes.”

6. Holding Gatekeepers in Check

Most services in the world today are centralized.

It’s clear that with Ethereum, Buterin has ideals he hopes to achieve in solving the world’s problems via information.

“I also believe that many of the old dichotomies of politics are becoming less relevant in the 21st century, particularly because — and this is something that people often fail to appreciate — the problems of today are increasingly all fundamentally informational in nature.”

He cites specific companies that are more centralized than most people think.

“Nearly all major intermediaries today — or at least the newer ones — have to do with being gatekeepers and trackers of information. Google, Uber, Airbnb, etc, are nothing but.”

7. Technology Needs to Bridge a Gap

The cryptocurrency industry needs to work with businesses.

As technological innovation moves at an ever-faster speed, projects like Ethereum must work closely with existing industries, according to Buterin.

“We are focusing heavily on interfacing with groups “on the edge” of the decentralization space: banks, civil liberties groups, financial reform groups, local currencies, etc; our communications department in London is talking to such people almost every day.”

Engineers and others who build things that people use everyday must become better at explaining technology.

“I also think that in tech/math/crypto in general, there is a chasm between media for mathematicians, which tends to be highly dense and math-loaded, and media for the general public, which doesn’t even try to explain how things actually work and often makes glaring errors.”

8. Cryptocurrencies Must Cater to Masses

People like to see right away the true utility of a new technology.

Instead of talking to people about how powerful a cryptography-based system is, Buterin says platforms should show users why its powerful.

“I generally think that crypto-platforms should market themselves not in terms of the way their underlying architecture works, but in terms of the properties that they have and what you can do with them; that’s the only way to get mass adoption.

Buterin specifically points out one of the largest companies in the world as a specific example.

“Apple doesn’t try marketing iPhones by talking about their next-generation screen technology, they show how sleek and shiny it is and how it has apps.”

9. Ethereum Will Launch in 2015

It will be available sooner than you think.

While Ethereum has been known as an official platform since a year ago, it hasn’t launched yet. Buterin says that will change in the near future.

“Ethereum is doing a staggered launch over the course of this year, the first phase of which is coming very very soon.”

10. Being a Thiel Fellow is Fun (of course)

Under 20? Peter Thiel will give you $100k to skip school.

Buterin is the recipient of a Thiel Fellowship, which is a $100,000 grant from PayPal co-founder and investor Peter Thiel. The idea is to enable smart young entrepreneuers the ability to pursue a project, forgoing college.

“The Thiel Fellowship is what you make of it. I’ve often said the fellowship only has three rules: (i) you can’t do nothing, (ii) you can’t do anything blatantly unethical or illegal, and (iii) you can’t go back to college.”

Networking is clearly one of the major benefits of being a Thiel Fellow according to Buterin.",https://medium.com/zapchain-magazine/vitalik-buterin-creator-of-ethereum-talks-bitcoin-s-most-ambitious-successor-f2c0e19364fe,['Daniel Cawrey'],2015-04-10 19:17:46.954000+00:00,"['Startup', 'Bitcoin', 'Finance']"
Tell the World Your Banking Horror Story,"This week marked a small victory over big bank lobbyists — the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will now allow consumers to publicly share their horror stories when they register a complaint against their bank.

The ability to register a complaint against your financial institution isn’t new — the Consumer Complaint Database has existed since 2012. But it was missing the most important part: the narrative about what actually happened to a customer. Did their bank fail to apply a payment? Were they charged for products they didn’t sign up for? Were they foreclosed on illegally? Previously, the details of the actual stories were kept hidden.

But beginning this week, if you need to file a complaint with the CFPB about your financial institution, you have the option of making the story of what happened to you public.

CFPB Director Richard Cordray announced the decision on March 18th, and wrote on the CFPB’s blog, “Making your story public will give more people, including you, the power to improve the financial marketplace.”

A coalition of consumer groups — led by Consumer Action — issued a statement praising the initiative, and noted that by reading the Complaint Narratives, consumers may be able to dodge financial bullets:

“Consumers will learn whether a billing dispute with a credit card issuer is a problem with a merchant or card company and where the process broke down. Those who search the database will be able to learn if foreclosure problems persist because a mortgage servicer continues to misplace key documents, and identify emerging trends that reveal how lenders treat homeowners with damaged credit when seeking new loans.”

The financial industry is, predictably, not happy about this.

Banks and their trade groups worked hard to ensure complaint details would never be added to the CFPB’s database. As I noted last year, Wells Fargo complained that “well-established privacy rights” could be violated by making these complaints public. And the Financial Services Roundtable, a powerful lobbying group led by former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, waged an aggressive campaign against the CFPB sharing complaint narratives. The Roundtable pushed back in a comment letter, told they press they were considering a lawsuit, and even launched an entire website devoted to trying to block the effort — albeit a website they eventually abandoned due to negative press attention.

Now that the decision has been made, some in the financial industry are already airing their grievances. The Consumer Banker’s Association, which represents retail banks, released a statement complaining that the CFPB will be publishing “unverified complaint narratives from unidentified consumers.” But the Consumer Banker’s Association’s concerns are unfounded: complaints are evaluated by the CFPB prior to publication. And the fact that consumers are not identified is a feature, not a bug, of the Complaint Database: the scrubbing of personal information is “modeled after the HIPAA Safe Harbor Method, which is generally considered to represent a best practice for de-identifying data.”

One has to wonder: how much better would consumer’s experiences be if, instead of lobbying against the mere airing of complaints, the financial industry re-directed that energy into actually solving the problems behind said complaints?

Despite ardent lobbying, the CFPB has sided with Main Street, and against the big bank trade groups. And this is a promising sign, given how many more chances the CFPB has to make the financial landscape fairer for consumers — from their ability to write rules to rein in payday lending, to their authority to prohibit forced arbitration clauses, which deny consumers their right to a day in court when their bank wrongs them.

By choosing to publish the details of consumer complaints against their banks, the CFPB has chosen to put consumer empowerment ahead of financial industry lobbying. Let’s hope this is just the first of many such instances.",https://medium.com/bull-market/tell-the-world-your-banking-horror-story-a8da1951e23b,['Alexis Goldstein'],2015-03-24 21:10:25.360000+00:00,"['Transparency', 'Cfpb', 'Banking']"

A reminder to look up.

It is only as of recent that I’ve realized it’s been a while since I looked around and took everything in that this country puts forth. A while since I didn’t stare at the reddish-brown suede of my birkenstocks as I walk through the markets and to class. It’s been a while since I looked up to the sky to take note of how the sun still shines smilingly in early December. It’s been a while since I let myself grin at unsuspecting strangers. Why is it that only today, I noticed that the man who sells books from a literal hole in the wall, which is the brightest light on my walk home in the early evening, is not at his perch?

I remember my freshman year of college, sitting in Professor Mackey’s sociology class, as he droned on about the concept of the “metropolitan consciousness.” The idea that living in cities and other busy, bustling places causes its inhabitants to develop a sense of indifference. It is a quality of the metro consciousness because people in cities are surrounded by so much stimulation they could never give their full attention to everything which surrounds them. George Simmel’s article, “The Metropolis & Mental Life” entails the stimulation of the city lights, the constant flow of people, and continuous sales making simply walking home an arduous process.

Yet, even in the ever-busy, incredibly loud, and inevitably disorienting streets of the Medina, on the off chance that I catch someone’s eye from the very corner of my periphery, they smile.

At me, a stranger.

At me, the perpetually lost-looking being.

At me, the pale-faced anti-hero, who looks at the ground and stares aimlessly at the cracks in the tiles. Why is looking up so hard?

Is it due to the discomfort and anger which consumes my whole being when the men on the street enter my space with a drawn out “Bonjour” and the licking of their lips and blowing of kisses? Can I not bare to make eye contact with the woman breastfeeding her child on the Medina floor, for she has no home to return to? Is it that I have run out of change to give to the man with his feet twisted spineward and cannot handle the sadness in his eyes? How is it that this city’s people can look one another in the eye and grin from ear to ear as they sing praise with an “al-hamdu li-Allah,” that they are blessed to meet another day, when some mornings I curse at my alarm for shaking me awake?

With less than two weeks until I return home, I am doing my best to lift my chin from my chest and allow the life of this city to breathe into me the same wonder and awe in which I first arrived with.

Outright glee in our second week in Rabat.

I will allow myself to smile at the children who dance and run, carelessly around me. I will not decline conversation with the petite older man from whom I purchase the most delicious clementines I’ve ever tasted. I will not deny myself the joy that is letting my own laughter resound from the insides of my ribcage to the very walls of the Medina. I will take these lessons and run with them. I will hold onto the happiness that these people have brought into my life over the course of the past four months. I will keep them as a reminder.

A reminder; this world is not out to get you.

All the love,

On Setting a Price For Your Work,"by Nina MacLaughlin

Time and materials. It’s a simple enough equation for how builders charge their clients. You are paid for the hours that you labor, and for the stuff needed for the job: the 2x4s and drywall and mesh tape; the tiles, the 80-pound sack of cement, the carton of grout; the lags, j-bolts, and pressure-treated 4x4s; the flooring, the paint, the baseboard, basecap, and crown molding.

For the past five years, I’ve been working as the assistant to a carpenter. My boss is a contractor who’s been in the trades for the last decade-plus. She and I build bookshelves, tile floors, tear down walls and put in new ones. We renovate kitchens from the floor to the ceiling. We redo bathrooms and attics and basements. We install skylights and build sturdy, beautiful decks. I am not involved in the estimates or the charging, and the pricing out of a job seems like a tricky thing, factoring in not just time and materials, but the unknowns we’ll inevitably encounter (a rotted joist below the floor; a windowframe pulped by woodchewing bugs), as well as how far away the job is and whether it’s on the third floor or first. I don’t know the math, the tangibles and intangibles that go into an estimate. What I do know is that my boss does extraordinary, high quality work and doesn’t charge enough.

Over and over, I’ve tried to convince her to charge more. I’ve been urging her to raise her hourly rate and charge the amount of money her work demands. It kills me when she says, after we’ve finished some big job, that after she’s paid me, as well as the plumbers, electricians, or plasterers she’s hired, that she only takes home a little for herself.

She raised her rates a few months ago, and I was thrilled to hear it. After all, how hard could it be to charge $3,000 for a set of built-in bookshelves as opposed to $1,800?

Much harder than I thought.

This last year was the first time I’ve had to charge people for the carpentry work I’ve done. As a gift for my brother, I made a table out of heartwood pine, a long table for feasts. It was a good first-go, crudely done and imperfect, but it does its job and the broad planks of wood had rich swirls. From there, other people, people I didn’t know, wanted me to make tables for them. I found myself for the first time in the position of having to put a value on the work.

So, time and materials. Wood is expensive. For a table I made out of lovely black walnut, six feet by four feet, the wood itself was close to $700. Another table, a round one, five feet across, I made with thick chestnut reclaimed from a salvaged barn in Monson, Mass. Those boards cost about $500. Time in these cases is not so straightforward: do I charge for the hours spent lying awake in bed planning out the project? Do I charge for the time spent putting the table together in my mind before I touch the wood? It would be unfair, at those early stages of table-building, to charge for every hour logged. So I come up with a number, almost arbitrary, based mostly on how much I’ve spent on wood. Oh, it has been uncomfortable saying, you owe me $950, which is what I charged for the big walnut table, or $800 for the round table made of chestnut. It sounds like so much money. But it is less than what they’re worth.

I’ve justified undercharging by telling myself I’m still learning, that these early commissions were opportunity to improve (and I have and continue to; each table is better than the last). It’s similar to the way writing used to feel: It used to be that being published was reward enough for the work. I was grateful for the opportunity to write, to have practice, to improve, and who cares if I was only paid $50, or nothing at all? I value my time more now. I value the writing work I do, and am able to be pickier about where to write for and how much they’ll pay. It took a while to get to that point.

The fact is, the tables are worth more than what I’ve been comfortable charging. It’s a matter of confidence, of recognizing that these tables I’ve made are lovely and strong and one-of-a-kind. As this year closes, as more table requests trickle in, as I get better and faster, I’m resolved to value the work, to value the labor, to value what I’m producing, and to follow the advice I’d given my boss for years.

On menopause,"Where are we now? Go to the website of Cancer Research UK and you will be told: “The evidence that HRT can cause some types of cancer (breast, womb and ovarian) is strong.” Go to the British Menopause Society website and its fact sheets will tell you the risk of cancer is “small” (breast) or “not high in statistical terms” (ovarian). Go to your GP and anything could happen.

Hannah Short is a trainee GP who set up the website Menopause UK in frustration at the confusing, poor information available not only to women, but to medical professionals. “The menopause wasn’t in any of my textbooks,” she told me during the British Menopause Society conference coffee break. She’s heard of women going to one GP to be put on HRT, then going to another who takes them off it. She’s heard of one GP who said that women just need to pull themselves together. She told me of a nurse who had gone through a surgical menopause who was treated as a hypochondriac when she complained her oestradiol treatment wasn’t working.

Most patients who end up in Julie Ayres’ menopause clinic in Leeds arrive with preconceptions. “They say, ‘I know there’s a risk of breast cancer.’” But they’re so desperate, they come anyway. “They come with palpitations, anxiety and panic attacks and think they’re going crazy.” They’re not, but they are suffering from the wide-ranging power of oestrogen in the body. “As soon as they say they’re having palpitations,” says Ayres, “the GP won’t prescribe HRT because of the cardiac risk.”

This would infuriate some speakers at the British Menopause Society conference, where John Stevenson, a consultant metabolic physician at the Royal Brompton Hospital, presented research on the protective role that HRT can have on the heart. He is so convinced of the benefits he’s prepared to prescribe HRT, because, according to him, it is “probably the best treatment for postmenopausal women, [though] sadly only one cardiologist seems to know this… If women come to see me who are at risk, I ask them if they’ve had a hot flush so I can prescribe HRT,” he says. “If they say no, we turn the heating up.”

It’s a good joke, but he is deadly serious: “There is hard evidence of the protective effect of oestrogen for adverse cardiac events. There’s no firm proof that HRT causes breast cancer.” He is dismissive of the Women’s Health Initiative study (and was one of Samuel Shapiro’s coauthors on the series of critiques published in 2011). “They got the same dose of hormones no matter what age. Great for a 50-year-old, absolute poison for a 70-year-old. No-one in this room would do that.”

The Daily Mail, which recently published a powerful and useful series on the menopause, often runs articles about ‘bioidentical hormones’, also known as bespoke HRT. Yehudi Gordon runs a bioidentical hormone clinic in Harley Street. He is slender, tanned and looks 20 years younger than his 73 years, and he is evangelical about the benefits of bioidentical hormones.

They are better, he said when we met over coffee near his clinic, because the oestrogens are derived from plants such as yam and soy, and the progesterone is micronised (finely ground). Both these facts, he claims, mean bioidentical hormones are better processed by the human body than conventional preparations. He gives mea handout which explains further: the molecular structure of Premarin, it reads, “may bear some similarity to that of human hormones, [but] it has been altered”. Other “branded and patented HRT consists of synthetic hormones that have a different molecular profile to those produced in the body”.

With his bioidentical therapy, patients have blood taken and are prescribed a particular hormone combination according to their hormonal levels, which is made by a compounding pharmacy (one that can make up its own preparations). To listen to Gordon, you’d think he had found the holy grail.

It’s persuasive. I leave almost tempted to make an appointment, despite the hefty private fees and cost of treatment (though Gordon says the HRT, daily, costs little more than a cappuccino). But other menopause specialists are circumspect. The bespoke preparations are prepared by a compounding pharmacy, but as Heather Currie wrote in an issue of Menopause Matters, “there are currently no controls or regulations on the production, prescribing or dosing of bioidentical hormones”. In the USA, custom-compounded hormones, as they are known, are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

“Bioidentical is just a brand,” says Nick Panay, a leading gynaecologist. “We can tailor HRT too: it’s the same stuff.” Julie Ayres has tested oestrogen levels in women taking ‘bespoke’ hormones and found them to be far too high. “We can try combinations of oestrogens and progesterone,” says Ayres. “We can prescribe bioidenticals. There are so many types of HRT. It’s great when we get it right. Women tell me they’ve got their life back. And I can’t tell you how often I’ve heard, ‘Thank you for taking me seriously.’”",https://medium.com/mosaic-science/on-menopause-16186eac58a1,[],2015-12-15 10:33:16.802000+00:00,"['Medicine', 'Menopause', 'Health']"
An emergent ‘us’,"Access to the internet has been defined as a basic human right by the United Nations. This is an age of two-way interactivity, where every digital human has a voice, an imagination and a unique ability to contribute. Everyone will make the Digital Era what it is. What are we going to do with that?

If we accept the idea that freedom of expression is an enlightened and preferred state of being, and we appreciate the importance of developing greater powers of human expression for the digital human instead of limiting it (this is an advantage, especially when competing with robots), it follows that cultivating organic interactivity across the web will create the most value out of it as a territory.

Natural and spontaneous behaviour will enable humans to be more of themselves and attain higher possibilities as a result of fusing code with the human condition.

This is less likely to come from gamification or behavioural techniques that herd digital activity into pre-determined pens of engagement or social media walled gardens like sheep. Products will be designed to meet real needs, rather than the ones we prescribe because we think we know our audiences.

The cultural leaps made in the Renaissance gave humankind vision and perspective. Being connected might mean a new human enlightenment may emerge from a better understanding of ourselves in relationship to others.

Digital humanity as an emergent and evolved species can develop a more nuanced mental and emotional intelligence. This is an enlightenment that may involve greater development of empathy, increased understanding of complexity, feeling comfortable with paradox and being able to hold opposable views simultaneously.

I think of the networked world as a rhizomatic central nervous system in pursuit of quality experiences, growing constantly, consciously and unconsciously, through the digital connections we make. We can evolve as digital humans by understanding what it is that we choose to connect to and the pathways we create and configure as a result of this pursuit.

As machine learning becomes ubiquitous, code is the conduit for this awareness. Encoding and processing experiences into digital media is how we capture, share and learn about the qualities of worldly experiences and what they feel like.

Code is becoming the interface that tells us how we can think, act and feel online in ways that can either be useful, enjoyable and inspired or meaningless and instantly forgettable.

As the ancient civilizations of the Fertile Crescent once created inventory, we are creating new inventory, the digital life that we post online.

It is a new, virtual state of existence. Scripting codes are our modern hieroglyphics. Networked communications are our frescoes and all of it is how we can tell our best stories.

In this new state of existence, we’re beginning to see how contemporary power is increasingly networked. The hashtag is one element of this. It’s evident too in how ideas spread and the viral nature of engagement online.

Commercially and politically, a post- capitalist world is emerging. Our developing relationship with the web as part of that might mean the conclusions we draw today about power today move on a little from Machiavelli’s. If we wish to thrive using code, an evolved set of power laws might be rooted more in the distributed policies for the Commons and open data rather than on secret deals done in the dark.

Organisation is being reconceived as the act of coming together to make things happen, more of a digital maypole today than four walls and a sign outside the door. Digital organisations are nodes made up of people and data that coalesce, responsively, to generate valuable, measurable outcomes. Organisation-as-the-act-of-organising is real time, it is dynamic, instead of a fixed and mechanical thing. It’s geared to meeting collective needs more than pushing product, recognising we have an abundance of resources.

These digital dynamics are powering the propagation of ideas in evolving ways, and they can create meaning and sustain value from us being connected. Businesses that have grown exponentially through word of mouth using collaborative business models know that fortunes can and are being built on broad consensus and the wisdom of the crowd.

By exposing ourselves to data and other people in large numbers, we are already creating outcomes based on where we put our attention. How we read and recognize what influences us online is part of a new digital literacy.

Machine learning has a part to play in unravelling twisted logic. It can support an emergent ‘us’. We scribe this process through the keystrokes we make. Our imperative, as humans instead of robots, is to use the choice to do it consciously.",https://medium.com/emergent-code/1-25-an-emergent-us-a0356b8c3c63,['Anne Mccrossan'],2015-12-13 15:42:59.486000+00:00,"['Technology', 'Civilization', 'Innovation']"

I listen to a lot of podcasts, read lots of articles, and generally try to stay on top of our ever-changing world on a daily basis. I purposely don’t stick to one set of sources with one point of view, and genuinely appreciate learning about the whole spectrum of views that are different from mine. Being told I’m wrong doesn’t scare me or piss me off — tell me why and I’m more than happy to listen. (I may still disagree with you, but I won’t dispute facts or let our differences define our friendship!)

I’m not the kind of person to even step into a discussion without being reasonably well-informed, but by the time I get to the point of finally speaking instead of just listening, I’m exhausted.

When did it become the norm to tear apart people with different opinions? I don’t mean their arguments — by all means, PLEASE equip yourself and debate as much as you want — I mean the actual people. Many blame it on the internet and “distance” of being able to type a comment instead of saying it to someone’s face, and I’m sure that’s a large part of it, but I’ve seen those fights erupt outside of comment threads, too.

There’s almost no such thing as a respectful, intelligent debate that sticks to the issue at hand and doesn’t devolve into name-calling and forever looking down on the other person as an inferior idiot. It’s such a frequent occurrence now that most of us just shrug and move on.

But what else happens? The people who would respectfully talk about the important things just don’t even bother, and I know I’m not the only one.

When did it ever become okay to tell someone they don’t even have a right to an opinion? Unless I am in absolute agreement with the “correct” opinion (and who defines that, anyway?), my perspective doesn’t matter. My perspective is considered part of “the problem,” and assumptions fly all over the place like bees in an Oprah gif.

Because I’m white, I can’t talk about Baltimore or ethnic tensions.

Because I’m middle-class, I can’t possibly understand anything about poverty.

Because I’m a straight woman who also presents as female, I can’t talk about any of the questions surrounding same-sex relationships, transgenderism, or anything in between.

At least the feminists would bother talking to me, right? Well, only the ones who would still consider me a feminist even though I’m pro-life and a Christian. (So you know, not many.)

I’m not a fan of labels, for myself or anyone else. And I’m not writing all this to be labeled as a poor little privileged girl who just wants an audience for her soapbox. I’m writing this as one of many people who are just plain tired, and to reach out, pat you on the back, and let you know you’re not alone.

It’s okay to be overwhelmed by the general suck all over social media and throughout humanity. We don’t have to declare our opinion on every single issue or get sucked in to every argument.

Just don’t give up. Keep your open mind, keep educating yourself, and have the humility to be wrong sometimes. But above all, don’t believe anyone who tells you that you don’t have a right to your own opinion.

Skating on Thick Ice,"Skating on Thick Ice

One December Evening Outside a Supermarket

Among the snowflakes she was ugly, and fat. Alright, overweight, but blatantly, squinting through thick glasses in a long bulbous coat that almost swept the snowy surface, altogether looking like an extra in some Siberian opera played out in the streets of life. She shuffled towards the supermarket in old, beaten shoes. I trudged up from the dirty entrance in the dirty snow, smokers and drinkers and spitters crowding the doorway.

As I passed her she slipped on a patch of ice suddenly, very quickly, about to topple, and looked at me in alarm, arm flailing, her mouth and eyes wide.

I grabbed her forearm with my left hand, then stumbled myself, and laughed aloud, as one does when confronted with the absurd: but she’d found her footing and I still clutched her arm, steadying myself.

“Mikä hyvä hymy!” She said, and smiled herself, a big crooked smile with crooked teeth, gesticulating with a free hand as she spoke, to ensure I’d understood. I hadn’t, but could understand ‘hyvä’— ‘good,’ so understood she was talking about my smile, or laughter.

She glowed with happiness purely because she had seen someone smile. Her eyes danced and she giggled somewhat voluptiously in embarrassment, among snowflakes that drifted calmly again. What a beautiful woman.

Memorial Day Reflections

Lets forget our dreams of mining asteroids and admit for a minute that there is only a finite amount of resources on Earth, and that all the people on Earth are competing for these resources. We’ll call groups of these competing peoples “nations”. Furthermore, let’s assume that resources like arable land, energy and water aren’t actually that abundant,and that really everyone can’t have everything; there simply isn't enough to go around. So the laws of scarcity kick in and only those nations who have these resources can accumulate the capital required to keep these resources. How does one gain or keep resources? At the point of a gun.

The simple, disheartening fact of the matter is that it doesn't appear there are enough resources on Earth to allow all 7 billion to enjoy the incredibly resource intensive western way of life. If all resources were magically distributed evenly, the western way of life would see a decrease in quality and the third world way of life a significant increase. But every last one of the 7 billion want and have as much of a right to the way of life we currently enjoy at the top as any of the other 7 billion. The only way to maintain this inequitable distribution of resources is, yes, at the point of a gun.

I keep bringing this gun thing up because I think of myself as a pacifist. I detest war and violence, both are foolish, doomed endeavors, and I do everything in my life to avoid it. I've often thought there are two types of people when it comes to conflict: fighters and refugees. I've always thought of myself as a refugee. If I was ever confronted with conflict, I would do everything in my ability to avoid it, and that includes running away. I feel that nothing is worth my life or the life of another human being, and that may be cowardice to some, but to me it’s not only survival, but survival without doing harm. But I cannot live in the western world and be an innocent refugee. It is impossible. Everything I have, every right and privilege I enjoy I am able to enjoy because it has been taken from someone else at the cost of life. Harm has been done to wrest these precious resources from the hands of the weak into my hands, you guessed it, at the point of a gun.

Despite being a refugee at heart, I must admit that I owe an enormous debt to the fighting men and women who have done the dirty work of obtaining that which I enjoy. How can I think of myself as a refugee, a pacifist, or anything more than a lucky coward if I’m just enjoying life on the backs of the lives of others, not only on the backs of those who have fought for my wealth and security, but on the backs of those who have lost their own. If it is true that an equitable distribution of resources would diminish my quality of life, and if I am unwilling to accept that, I must therefore be willing to take what I need to maintain my life at, yet again, the point of a gun.

So where does that leave people like me? If a person who thinks like me does not willingly give up what they have for the good of others, we are unfortunately in an awkward position of hypocrisy. I donate my money to worthy causes, sure, but I still take a larger part of the global resource pie than most. It is a difficult question to which I have not yet found an answer. So I think. I meditate on this apparent conflict between my beliefs and my nature, and I come to the unavoidable conclusion that while I may not agree with the method, I owe an important and unpayable debt to those who secure my way of life at the point of a gun.",https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/at-the-point-of-a-gun-46df5849cb73,['Jeremy Martin'],2015-02-25 23:16:56.649000+00:00,"['Reflection', 'Thankfulness']"
The Music Industry’s Next Shake Up,"Last week singer-songwriter Imogen Heap held a small press conference at the Sonos Studio in London. During the event she debuted her new song Tiny Human, and shared a vision for the future. A future where artists and music lovers transact with each other directly. A future where digital rights lie in the hands of creators not corporations. You could call it fair trade music or a direct music distribution marketplace, but whatever you call it it’s the start of something new.

Imagine a world where you can pay for music and know exactly who will be paid for that music up front — down to each musician, publisher, and recording artist. A world where you can create music and you get to decide what the price will be and under what conditions it can be used. A world where content is permanent and unchanging and everything can be found in one place. At first this all sounds complicated and in-feasible, and it would have been just a few years ago, but new technology is making all this possible with just a few lines of code.

You don’t need to sell your privacy for “free” services. You don’t need to worry about servers going offline. You don’t even have to worry about credit cards if you don’t want to. And music is just the beginning. This could be the beginning of a technology that could change our lives as much as the internet did.

There are exciting times ahead, stay tuned.

How to Download Imogen Heap’s New Song “Tiny Human”

1. Buy some bitcoin

Why do you need bitcoin? It’s kinda what makes all this new tech possible. If you’re new to crypto currencies I suggest you do a little reading (but it’s not required)

I like to use an app called Circle so I’m going to show you how to get some bitcoin using this simple app, but if you already have bitcoin skip to the next step.

Download the Circle app for Android or iOS

Add a debit card or bank account or debit card (click settings>Cards and Banks)

Buy some bitcoin maybe $5 worth

2. Create an account at Imogen’s download site

Go to: https://alpha.ujomusic.com/#/imogen_heap/tiny_human/tiny_human

Click download

Click New Wallet

Give it a password (you’ll need this later)

Click download again

You’ll see something a little different now.

See that funny looking address? (Your address will be different)

Address: 0xaadd74f71770fbef7325860bce13cff05e3ad1c9

This is the place we need to put some money in order to download the song

2. Fund the address

Ok so this next part might be a little tricky. You need to convert your bitcoin to a currency called Ether. To do this head over to a site called shapeshift.io (it works best to do this on a desktop computer)

This site allow us to fund our address so we can buy the song.

Click to select the coin ETH (you’ll get a big warning, but it’s nothing to worry about)

There are a few things we need to do now.

Enter the amount of ETH we need. You can find this number back on the download page in my case it’s 1.030577252542372881ETH (you may want to round up)

Enter the address from the download page. In my case it’s 0xaadd74f71770fbef7325860bce13cff05e3ad1c9

After you click Start, open the circle app on your phone and click on QR code and scan the code on your screen.

Follow the steps to transfer some of the bitcoin you purchased with circle to shapeshift.

Shapeshift will then convert your bitcoin to ether, and the deposit the ether for you.

The conversion my take a few minutes to complete, but it shouldn’t take too long. After the conversion has completed head back to the download page.

3. Purchase the song

From the download page click the box “Click to Purchase”

Enter your password (hit enter)

The song should download on it’s own

You have now purchased music directly from the artists who produced it. They were paid instantly and fairly. Welcome to the future.

This is all still a big experiment so if you have any problems with your download you can contact ujo music directly here.",https://medium.com/business-startup-development-and-more/the-music-industries-next-shake-up-caf047039ddd,['Kenny Rowe'],2015-10-08 21:10:23.708000+00:00,"['Music', 'Blockchain', 'Bitcoin']"
Welcome to #BIF2015,"Maybe I’m just getting old, but the self-imposed pressure to get better faster, and to rise to the occasion of the enormous social system challenges we all face, has never been more acute. I feel a heightened sense of urgency.

I don’t know about you, but #BIF2015 on September 16–17 in Providence Rhode Island comes at the perfect time for me. I need the annual fix of connection and inspiration I get from hanging out at our BIF Collaborative Innovation Summit with you — the BIF community of like-minded innovation junkies from around the world. I’m betting you can use an inspiration fix too!

I never know what collisions, patterns, and stories will most move and inspire me in advance of each summit. I do know that each and every Summit has surprised me in unique ways. I look forward to the two days of the Summit every year. I’m grateful and blessed to spend them colliding with you. Bring on the random collisions of unusual suspects and let the inspiration begin!

I also know that after 10 years of hosting the Summit, it never gets old. It delivers every year. #BIF2015, our 11th summit, will deliver too. Not because this year’s storytellers are more inspiring than ever — although they are. Not because this year’s participants are more pre-wired for collaborative innovation than ever — although you are. Not because the market screams for transformation more than ever — although it does. Not because the BIF team has poured their hearts and souls into creating the perfect conditions for #BIF2015 — although they have. #BIF2015 will deliver because of you.

If we have learned anything from our first decade it’s that if we trust you, the BIF community, the BIF Summit will deliver. We don’t prescribe what should be important to you. We don’t tell you who to collide or connect with. We don’t tell you what to take away from the amazing stories or what patterns will emerge over the two days of the Summit.

Instead, you decide. You decide what’s important enough to share with other Summit participants. You decide what to share with your networks. You decide what insights to act upon. You decide, and we all learn together. You engage, and we all engage together. You’re inspired, and we all inspire each other. You act, and we all act together. You’re the magic of the BIF Summit. We trust you. Bring it!

Over the first decade of the BIF Summit, we have nailed self-organized networks. The BIF community knows that innovation is a team sport, and highly values connection and sharing. We skew social and have been active travelers on every new social media platform. We leave no connection opportunity unturned! We are direct and honest with each other, and we know that being interesting starts with being interested.

The BIF community also knows that if we wait for institutions and institutional leaders to transform our important social systems, we will wait a very long time. It is up to us to use our new self-organizing superpowers to catalyze the societal changes we want. Institutions will come along once they realize that resistance is futile!

My dream for our second decade at BIF is that we get much better at making our self-organized networks purposeful. We’ve got the connecting and sharing part down. Now it’s time to work on making our networks actionable, to get stuff done. Watch out when we get both the self-organized and purposeful parts right. There will be no stopping us!

Our BIF mantra is “Connect, Inspire, Transform”. It’s time to up the ante on Transform. Together we will catalyze something bigger than any of us separately. We can make reinvention safer and easier to manage. The connections we make and reinforce at the Summit provide the basis for us to collaborate and take action throughout the year, exploring and testing new business models and social systems. Together, we need to try more stuff.

I have high expectations — I know that you in the BIF community are ready, willing, and able. So buckle up, because our second decade promises to be an inspiring and productive ride. I’m grateful for the opportunity to learn from you, to be inspired by you, and to change the world together.

Welcome to #BIF2015.

P.S. If you made it to the end of this post I take it you’re interested in #BIF2015!

The Physics of Back to the Future,"Mr. Strickland: “I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don’t have a chance. You’re too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!”

Marty McFly: “Yeah, well, history is gonna change.” -Back To The Future

A tale of wrongs righted and second chances, Back to the Future — the trilogy of iconic 80s movies — offers a tantalizing possibility to mistake-makers everywhere: the ability to travel to the past and fix your (or your ancestors’) mistakes, and the ability to travel to the future, scope out your (or your descendants’) misfortunes, and adjust your actions accordingly.

It’s every perfectionist’s dream.

Image credit: Back to the Future, 1985, via GoneMovie.com.

But what does physics have to say about these scenarios? First off, the notion of time-travel is one that doesn’t belong on the “fiction” side of science-fiction: it’s the one thing in science that you can’t help yourself from doing no matter what you do! Whether you held perfectly still or accelerated to nearly the speed of light, you, in your own frame of reference, are always traveling through time at the same rate: one second per second.

Sure, that doesn’t sound like a very profound statement, but when Einstein put forth special relativity in 1905, that was just one of its astounding implications.

Image credit: Wikimedia Commons user Lookang.

For another, we learned that photons — or any massless particle, for that matter — cannot experience time at all in their frame of reference: from the instant one is emitted to the instant it’s absorbed, only massive observers (like us) can see the passage of time. From the photon’s reference frame, the entire Universe in its direction-of-travel contracts down to a single point, and absorption and emission happens all at the same time: instantaneously.

But we have mass. And for anything that has mass, you’re limited to always travel at less than the speed of light in a vacuum. Not only that, but no matter how fast you’re moving relative to anything else — whether you’re accelerating or not — you’ll always perceive light to be moving at that one constant speed: c, the speed of light in a vacuum.

This is a powerful observation and realization, and it comes with a fascinating consequence: if you observe someone in motion relative to you, their clock will appear to run slow.

Image credit: John D. Norton, via http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/teaching/HPS_0410/chapters/Special_relativity_clocks_rods/.

Imagine a “light clock,” or a clock that works on the principle of light being bounced back-and-forth in the up-and-down direction between two mirrors. The faster the person in motion moves relative to you, the more the light’s velocity will move in that transverse (across) direction, rather than in the up-and-down direction, and hence the slower their clock will appear to run.

By the same token, your clock will appear to move slow with respect to them; they’ll see time passing more slowly for you! Clearly this can’t be the case for both of you: when the two of you get together again, one of you will be older and one will be younger.

Which one?

That’s the nature of the Einstein “twin paradox” problem. The short answer: assuming you started off in the same frame of reference (at rest on Earth, for example), and you wind up in that same frame of reference at a later time, the person who did the traveling will have aged less, having had time pass at the “slow” rate, while the person who remained at home will have had time pass at the “normal” rate.

Image credit: © 2015 Twin Paradox, via http://www.twin-paradox.com/.

So if you want to travel ahead in time quickly, just accelerate to a fast (near-light) speed, move at that speed for some time, and then come back to rest at your initial location. (This will involve some turning around!) Do that, and you can — depending on the theoretical quality of your equipment — travel days, months, decades, eons, or billions of years into the future!

You can witness the evolution and destruction of humanity; the end of the Earth and Sun; the dissociation of our galaxy; the heat death of the Universe itself. So long as you have enough power in your space ship, you can travel as far into the future as you like.

Image credit: the Economist, via http://timelessbreakthroughs.economist.com/is-time-travel-already-happening/.

But backwards is another story. Simple Special Relativity, or the relationship between space and time on a basic level, was enough to get us into the future. But if we want to go back — or into the past — we’ll need to go to General Relativity, or the relationship between spacetime and matter and energy. In this case, we treat space and time as an inseparable fabric, and matter and energy is what warps it, or causes changes in that fabric itself.

For our Universe as we know it, spacetime is pretty boring: it’s almost perfectly flat, barely curved at all, and in no way, shape or (discernible) form loops back on itself.

Image credit: Science News / Nicole Rager Fuller, via https://www.sciencenews.org/article/special-report-gravity%E2%80%99s-century.

But in some model Universes — in some solutions to Einstein’s General Relativity — you can loop back on yourself. If space loops back on itself, you can travel in one direction for a long, long time, and wind up right back where you started: a consequence of a closed Universe.

Well, you can not only have solutions with closed space-like curves, but you can have spacetimes with closed time-like curves as well, meaning you can literally go Back to the Future!

Image credit: New Scientist / John Papasian.

But that’s a mathematical solution; does that mathematics describe our physical Universe, though? It appears not to be the case. The curvatures and/or discontinuities we’d need our Universe to have are wildly incompatible with what we observe, even near neutron stars and black holes: the most extreme examples of curvature in our Universe.

Our Universe could be rotating on a global scale, but observed limits on rotation are some 100,000,000 times too stringent to admit the closed time-like curves we’re craving. If you want to go forward in time, a souped-up DeLorean — assuming “souped-up” means relativistic — will get you there, as will a souped-up train, which was Einstein’s initial idea!

But going backwards? Perhaps it’s better that you can’t go back in time, prevent your father from marrying your mother, and creating a time paradox.

Futurama aside, the idea of traveling backwards in time will likely continue to fascinate humanity, but that half of time travel — the “back” half — will almost certainly remain a fiction eternally into the future. It’s not mathematically impossible, but the Universe is based in physics, which is a special subset of mathematical solutions. In this case, our dreams of correcting our mistakes by going to the past will likely exist in our imaginations alone.",https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/the-physics-of-back-to-the-future-137774bb43e7,['Ethan Siegel'],2015-10-21 17:08:47.141000+00:00,"['Science', 'Physics', 'Time Travel']"
Rewriting elixirstream.com from Rails to Phoenix,"The title seems a little bit strange at first but just hang on here for a second, I will explain it bit by bit. We launched http://elixirstream.com with existing code base from http://emberflare.com to have a blog post and article sharing platform for fellow Alchemists. The code base itself was written in Rails and we wanted to launch it as quickly as possible bearing in mind that we will rewrite it to Phoenix and Elixir as soon as we can. And what you know, it happened! The purpose of this blog post is to share my findings in regards to Phoenix as a framework from a technical standpoint and give a brief overview of user authentication process, which covers most of the necessary parts of the web development and will allow you to start building “real world” apps. I want to warn you that is is my first Phoenix app so some of my understanding about the conventions might be wrong. Anyways, the critique is always welcome. :)

Registration process

The first bit of the application I wanted to tackle was the registration and logging in of the user.In the previous Rails app we used has_secure_password that is built in Rails to hash our passwords. Under the good it uses the Bcrypt encryption algorithm that generates different hashes each time you do an encryption, yet allowing to compare them for equality. For Elixir side of things, I found an amazing library to do password encryption and compare the encrypted password to the unencrypted counterpart: http://hexdocs.pm/comeonin/. I checked it against my own encrypted password and it worked like a charm. Let’s take a look at the users model:

The purpose of the ecto model is to define validations and to transport the data. I really enjoy the concept of changesets. Once you call the following code:

The changeset is being created with the name of our model as a first argument and the parameters for a given model as a second argument. Both required and optional parameters are being cast to corresponding model columns, or more precisely, values on our %User{} struct. After that is done, we simply pipe the changeset to a chain of validation functions. One thing to note here, that Ecto can also be validated the data against our repository (database) like so:

After the data has gone trough the validations, the changeset is being returned to us. It is either valid or invalid. The thing to note here is that User does not store the actual password in the database, that’s why we had to use a virtual attribute on the model to achieve that. The line field :password, :string, virtual: true allows us to set this attribute, yet not store it in the database on the insert or update. The line use Ecto.Model.Callbacks allows us to define callback functionality to our models. We set the password digest at before_insert :set_password_digest. This made me cringe at first, and if you check commit history, you can see that my attempt was to avoid callbacks at any cost. The reason behind my cringing is simple — I have been bitten by ActiveRecord callbacks multiple times, but this is different since this is the data that has to be there at any insert and after a brief discussion with my colleague, we agreed to use callbacks password hashing. In the function set_password_digest we see that we get the password field of the changeset and then update our password_digest with it’s encrypted counterpart:

After this function is done with its task, we have a changeset that we can store.

I want to abstract from the framework as much as possible, so I created a RegisterAction in /lib folder.

As you can see, it just casts the parameters to a user struct and performs validations on it. If is valid, then we return {:ok, user} tuple and if the changeset is invalid, we return an {:error, changeset} tuple. In the first case, we return the user to have the ability to add user.id to set a session in the controller. In the second case, we need to return a changeset to show error messages on the form. The code in controller looks like following:

Please note the line put_session(:user_id, user.id) where we put a user.id in a session. In Phoenix controller actions, you always have a connection or conn for short. This is where the all connection data is stored, including sessions, assigns (We will talk about that later), headers e.t.c.

So, after this we have a session set and how do we provide a user’s context to the application? After a brief research, I decided to go with writing a custom plug and adding current user to conn assigns. Let’s see example:

We import Plug.Conn and Plug.Session to import all functions that can work with sessions and the connection data set itself.

To have a plug that we can use in our controllers, we need to have call implemented with two arguments. First one is the connection and the second one is the options we pass. Since we don’t care about the second argument, we just ignore it.

We try to get user_id from a session user_id = get_session(conn, :user_id). If the session is set, we find given user in the database in line assign(conn, :current_user, ElixirStream.Repo.get(ElixirStream.User, user_id)) and put it in to the connections assigns. This allows us to maintain current user across all the actions.

If we want to use this authentication mechanism and setting of the current_user, we just add this plug to our controller in following way:

Now, each controller action’s conn will or will not contain current user in assings. We can access our assigns like so @conn.assigns[:current_user] which in turn will return nil or a %User{} struct containing logged in user.

So how can we use it in templates to see current user’s avatar or username? The answer is view! In the web/views/layout_view.ex we define the following function:

If we want to get current user in view, we can do it in following way:

This about concludes the brief overview of the registration process of http://elixirstream.com

Conclusions

What I love about Phoenix, is that it gives an ease of mind. All the things that are happening are under your nose and you don’t get lost in all the objects that are flying around. I am looking at you Rails!

Even if documentation sometimes is scarce, it is a great pleasure to write a web app in Phoenix. It took some time to understand all the concepts behind it, but now that I’ve done the full cycle, the next one will be easier.

Upward & Down,"The tree in the yard grew vibrantly, upward toward the sky. Its limbs stretched and reached brilliantly, as if to ask:

“Sky, sun, rain, and earth — make me into something great!”

The flowers and the shrubs around the tree watched in awe, waiting, with fresh leaves and strong roots, for this tree to become something great, as they all knew that it would.

The young gardener boy who had planted the tree arrived early one morning, just as winter began to fade and spring began to arrive. He circled the yard, pruned some of the shrubs, picked some of the flowers, and came to a halt at the tree.

The tree had yet to sprout fruit from its branches. But the young boy was patient. He watered the tree, and decided to come back the next season when the tree had developed enough to bear fruit.

Over the summer and into the fall, the whole garden grew, and watched the tree grow, despite its barren branches. Through the scorching heat of midsummer evenings, and the shivering cold of the early year, the tree reached up to the sky, as if to plead:

“Sky, sun, rain, and earth — make me into something great!”

The next season, the young boy returned. He circled the yard, pruned the shrubs, picked the flowers, and came to a halt at the tree.

The branches had grown, and hung just over his head, but still, no fruit had emerged from the ends of the limbs. The boy shrugged, pulled out a bag of fertilizer, and spread the rich, heavy soil at the base of the tree. Once the roots were nearly suffocating in nutrients, he stood, brushed the dirt from his hands, and left.

The tree felt stilted as it grew, into the summer and over the fall. It felt outpaced, and unprepared for growing. But the rest of the garden watched it attentively, waiting for fruit to emerge. And yet, it never did. January came quickly, and the tree’s naked branches reached for the white sky, yearning and pleading for something more than itself.

The young boy returned the next season, but instead of circling the garden, he went straight for the tree. He yelled and muttered in disappointment, and kicked the tree’s trunk in anger. The thin, fast-growing bark split open, and the young boy paused, in an instant realization.

He left quickly and returned with shears and clippers. He set up a step stool, and climbed up to prune the branches.

“There,” he said, when the tree had been pruned. “That will teach you to grow fruit. You’re meant to grow fruit. I know this, because I planted you, I did.”

The boy left, and the tree hung, sadly and silently, with sap dripping from its muted branches. But the garden grew forward, into the New Year. The tree slowly recovered, and by the next season, it had renewed itself.

The boy arrived once more, and cursed the tree as he saw the naked branches.

“I planted you, ” he said, with contempt in his voice. “Why won’t you grow fruit, like you should?”

But his anger was short lived. He disappeared and returned quickly, with tape and a knife and a handful of fresh, green branches. The tree watched as the boy sliced into the limbs and grafted on the twigs of another tree. He dumped loads of fertilizer at the base of the tree, stood, and left.

The garden seemed to stretch and warp in the tension of the season, but not compared to the tree itself. The fertilizer accelerated the tree beyond health and beyond movement, and its bark cracked with the explosion of growth. The tree stretched and screamed, but no fruit grew.

The young boy returned to the garden the next season, and his eyes fell in disappointment. The tree stood, torn and stilted, with barren limbs and awkward grafts.

The boy grabbed his axe and called for others to join him. He pointed to the tree, but the other men corrected him, and pointed to the ground around the tree.

He dropped the axe, and retrieved a shovel. He sunk the shovel deep into the earth, to loosen the tree from the ground.

His shovel hit something, hidden in the dirt. He knelt to examine it.

Juice from a bright red fruit spilled into the dirt, split open by the shovel blade. He cleared the dirt to see a vast network of berries, clinging to the roots: Bright, vibrant, and alive.

The freshly awakened smell of the subterranean fruit met his senses.

He stood and threw the shovel aside.

Search as Main Navigation,"An intuitive alternative to traditional website headers.

Man, main navigation is the worst. Just, like… the worst. Before you go leveling accusations of UX heresy, hear me out. Traditional header navigation is often bloated, surprisingly useless, and a blight upon responsive design.

Like most horizontal layouts, header navigation doesn’t scale down to small screens. Most people just hide it all behind a hamburger icon as soon as things get too narrow. That’s a bad UI pattern on two counts…

If those main navigation links aren’t important enough to display on mobile devices, why are they the most visually prominent elements on wide screens? (See my article on why Responsive Design is an Ethos.) A growing pile of usability studies shows that hamburger icons are not an effective way to drive content discovery, primarily because a lot of people just haven’t learned what it means yet.

This garbage is your best case scenario.

And all for what? Just in case a person who came to your site looking for sports news might want to jump directly to the entertainment section? In my experience, that kind of browsing is a lot less likely than 1) using search to find something or 2) clicking directly to a piece of related content. (That’s called contextual navigation. Read more about it in my article on Bottom-Up Navigation.)

It would make a lot more sense to strip down our site headers, bring the content right up to the top of every page, and handle contextual navigation in the body of the page. The only things that need to be in the header are branding (a link to the homepage) and the search box.

All You Need is Search

You know how search boxes often suggest things to you as you type? I say, why wait for the user to type anything? What if we suggested our sites’ most valuable pages to users as soon as they click into the search box? It’d be pretty much the same crap we’d cram into main navigation (hub pages, featured content, About Us), but neatly stacked in a vertical menu and not displayed until the user needs them.

When the user does start typing, replace these with actual type-ahead suggestions.

You get plenty of space for a usable search box, a slim header that lets you get right to the content, and the sublime joy of never having to find a shorter name for a hub page because there’s “not enough room” in the header.

“But how will people know it’s there?” I can already hear you asking. That’s the most beautiful thing about this madness: it’s a usability problem that solves itself! I actually tested this idea during my time in the content marketing salt mines and here’s how it went down in 100% of cases…

Researcher: “Now, imagine that you want to find a page that lists all of the [topic name] [nouns]. How would you do that?” Participant: “Well, I don’t see any main navigation links — that’s weird — so I guess I’d try search. [Participant clicks into the searchbox.] Oh! There they are! I’d just click on that.

Never has there been a more literal instance of “surprise and delight.” This approach makes main navigation discoverable at the instant users are trying to find it and not one moment before. It creates a tiny amount of tension when users don’t see the header nav they’ve been trained to expect, then relieves that tension in a burst of wayfinding catharsis. It’s user experience legerdemain, I tell you!

And it’s even responsive. In fact, Google does something similar when you need to input a location for directions…

So don’t gimme any crap about the keyboard getting in the way.

We’re Crushing On: Andrew Stover,"Andrew Stover, creator of Vino50 wines and Wine Enthusiast’s “40 Under 40” Tastemaker

Creator of Vino50 Wines, Larger-Than-Life Sommelier, and “40 Under 40” Tastemaker

I met Andrew Stover when we were preparing to open DCanter A Wine Boutique back in 2013. My business partner and I were in search of unique, off-the-beaten path wines. Andrew definitely had plenty to show us when we came by his company’s Virginia warehouse for a tasting. We tasted what seemed like 100 wines — a number of which were from unbelievable places like New Mexico, Idaho, Arizona, Hawaii. What? At the time, it was crazy to think that these places could produce wines that actually met DCanter’s quality standards. But we found some gems that we continue to showcase at the shop.

Andrew has an incredible personality, always discovering what’s fun and new in American wine and beyond. He is the creator of Vino50 Wines, a highly curated portfolio of American wines, particularly from newly emerging wine regions in the United States. He is also a trained sommelier, working the restaurant scene and was named a “40 Under 40 Tastemaker” by Wine Enthusiast in 2015. Let’s get to know him a little more, shall we?

So, Andrew, tell us:

Me: How’d you get into the biz? What was your first job?

AS: First job was in media sales for WhereTraveler, a local city mag found in hotels/concierge desks. I worked with loads of restaurants on marketing programs to get hotel visitor business through their doors, so I was always exposed to new openings, chefs, and so on. Some of my work was with the Loudoun County Convention and Tourism Association, and with that brought winery visits. It was where I met Paul Breaux of Breaux Vineyards and ended up taking a part-time job in their tasting room a few weekends a month so I could learn more about wine. This is circa 2000/2001.

The interest in wine grew due to my interest in travel. Wine is all about places and people. I enrolled in various wine courses, which culminated with the International Sommelier Guild Sommelier Diploma Program over 2004–2006. I passed the 12-hour exam in 2006 and began offering marketing and wine consulting services to restaurants, especially those I knew from working in media sales while I was at Where. OYA Restaurant was one of my first consulting clients. I also helped build the programs for Extra Virgin in Arlington (now shuttered), Panache Tysons Corner (now shuttered), plus Smith Commons, SEI Restaurant and Sax Restaurant & Lounge, to name a few.

Me: What’s the hardest part about working in the wine world?

AS: It depends on which aspect of the business. If we just focus on sales and marketing, the hardest thing is the amount of competition. There is just so much wine out there and so many people trying to sell wine. It is often difficult to distinguish one’s self from the crowd, which is true for any winery or wine-focused company. What makes them different? What makes them special? I find that focusing in on the unusual regions and grape varieties is one means to stand out. Who wants to hawk yet another California red wine when you can hawk a standout red wine from Maryland?

Me: About a winemaker/winery you feel more people should know about?

AS: [That’s a] tough call. There are so many things I could insert here. How about we select a winery and then a wine region?

Andrew Stover #winepimping wtih Maynard Keenan, winemaker of Caduceus Cellars.

For winery, I think more people need to know about Caduceus Cellars and Maynard Keenan. Sure he’s a well-known recording artist/musician known in some circles but his wines don’t always get discussed as much as I feel they should. I really love his extreme passion for making wines in the high desert of Arizona and New Mexico, and his style is very natural and elegant. There is very little that he does to manipulate the fruit or the outcome of the wine. The wines just happen. Follow him on Instagram for lots of winemaking folly. (@puscifer on Instagram)

A wine region that’s very exciting to me right now is the south of England. The soil is almost a carbon copy of that found in Champagne, France, with similar climatic conditions. Heck, some vineyard sites in England are approximately 90 miles from the Champagne region. The quality of many of the traditional-method sparkling wines from England easily rival that of the best of Champagne and often with more racy acidity and finesse. England should be on everyone’s watch list.

Me: English wine? Noted! Okay, so when you’re not drinking wine, what’s in your glass?

AS: Beer of course! There is a saying many winemakers have: “it takes a lot of good beer to make a lot of good wine.” I enjoy a wide variety of styles, but tend toward more savory beers with a hoppy edge. I love the Atlas Rowdy rye from DC and Ninkasi Total Domination IPA from Oregon.

Me: What’s on your playlist these days?

AS: A mix of very random things, that’s for sure. If it’s not the Nike running mix curated by Spotify, it’s often music I’ve heard on various trips. Brooke Fraser brings me back to New Zealand. The Babasonicos brings me back to Argentina. El Sueno de Morfeo brings me back to Spain. Of Monsters and Men brings me back to Iceland.

Me: What’s your guilty pleasure?

AS: Chocolate and peanut butter. The peanut butter spooned right from the jar onto a basic everyday milk chocolate bar. Always Jif, it’s the best.

Me: What inspired your signature “duck face” look?

AS: [The] one [we] have renamed #winepimping face? God only knows where it first started but I always get accused of “aerating” other beverages besides wine. I’ve been caught aerating water in fact. It’s just a subconscious act. The real thrust of this “look” got going back with my good winery friend, Cara Early, general manager for Girardet Winery in the Umqua Valley of Oregon. Cara was visiting the area on a sales [and] marketing trip, and while in my car we decided to take a selfie. But not just any selfie, it was the duck face which we then dubbed the #winepimping face because that’s what we do — we pimp [out] wine! It’s been all downhill since, and now I am stuck being known as “that guy” with the duck face.",https://medium.com/winelife/we-re-crushing-on-andrew-stover-fea25e874666,['Michelle Lim Warner'],2015-12-02 03:00:47.236000+00:00,"['Wine', 'Tastemaker', 'Live']"
Is Nicotine the Next Big Smart Drug?,"People often confuse the effects of caffeine with the effects of coffee, even though caffeine and coffee are different substances (coffee has hundreds of chemicals; caffeine is just one of them). Likewise, nicotine gets the headlines when it comes to tobacco, even though it’s just one of the 5,000+ chemicals in cigarette smoke.

There’s a lot more to nicotine than smoking and addiction. Like caffeine, it’s a powerful smart drug, and when you get it at low doses in its pure form — without toxins and carcinogens wrapped around it and rolled into a cigarette — nicotine can be a formidable (if occasional) biohack. Based on my experience with it, and on history, I predict that nicotine (not smoking) will become much more popular for performance and cognitive enhancement. After all, about 99% of great works of literature in the last 200 years (p > .05) were written under the influence of coffee and nicotine! But just how safe is it?

Here’s an overview of the ups and downs of nicotine, along with a few practical and safety tips if you decide to add it to your biohacking arsenal.

This post is likely to piss off at least a few people. Sorry about that; I don’t like smoking and I’ve never been a smoker. This science is solid — nicotine is an extensively studied psychoactive chemical. I invite you to separate nicotine from the stigma of tobacco and read this post with an open mind.

What is nicotine?

Like caffeine, nicotine is a defense mechanism made by plants to keep from being eaten by animals, bugs, or fungus — in fact, caffeine and nicotine are in the same chemical family. Many plants produce nicotine and store it in their leaves; it’s bitter and toxic in large doses, keeping hungry animals at bay. Nicotine is most famously in tobacco, but you’ll also find small amounts of it in members of the nightshade family — tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplants, for example. There’s even a tiny bit of nicotine in cauliflower.

Nicotine is toxic to smaller animals, but humans can withstand a good deal of it — and derive benefits from it. When nicotine reaches your brain, it binds to nicotinic receptors (guess where they got their name?), activating pathways that control attention, memory, motor function, and pleasure. Nicotine attaches to several types of nicotinic receptors; each receptor affects your brain in a specific way.

Nicotine enhances coordination, vigilance, memory, and reaction time

Excess nicotine is toxic, but when you get the right amount, nicotine does a lot for you. For starters, it gives you faster, more precise motor function. People show more controlled and fluent handwriting after taking nicotine, and they’re also able to tap their fingers faster without sacrificing accuracy. The finger tap test is one I used in the original tests of human performance on Bulletproof mold-tested Upgraded Coffee vs. generic coffee — it appears that mold slows down your finger tap speed. (That test is published in The Bulletproof Diet book.)

Nicotine makes you more vigilant, too. Participants who used nicotine patches were able to pay attention to a mentally tiring task longer than controls could. Nicotine gum did the same thing.

Nicotine also sharpens your short-term memory. People who took nicotine better recalled a list of words they’d just read, and also repeated a story word-for-word, making fewer mistakes than people given placebo made. Again, the boost in memory came from both patches and gum.

You can even speed up your reaction time with nicotine. Both smokers and nonsmokers reacted more quickly to visual cues after a nicotine injection — although I’ll save my injections for vitamins, thanks.

Finally, nicotine suppresses appetite. If you’re looking to lose weight and you’re getting food cravings, a small dose of nicotine could help eliminate them. One randomized, double-blind study showed that combining low-dose nicotine gum with caffeine enhanced appetite suppression, so adding nicotine to Bulletproof Intermittent Fasting once in awhile may boost your fast. It’s the Bulletproof version of coffee and cigarettes.

To recap, nicotine:

refines your motor skills

heightens your ability to pay attention

improves your short-term memory

speeds up your reaction time

Suppresses appetite, especially when combined with caffeine

Slow-release patches, low-dose gum, mouth sprays, and injections all work, but some have more risks than others. More on how to take nicotine in a minute.

The downsides of nicotine

There are some real downsides to nicotine, the most infamous of which is its addictive potential. Nicotine activates your mesolimbic dopamine system, which scientists have aptly nicknamed the brain’s “pleasure pathway.”

The pleasure pathway is a double-edged sword. Food, sex, love, and rewarding drugs all cause this part of your brain to light up, sending a euphoric rush of dopamine through your system and leaving you in bliss. If you indulge on a regular basis, though, the constant stimulation dulls the pathway. Your receptors start to pull back into your neurons, where they are very hard to activate, and you start to feel physically ill unless you get more of whatever you were enjoying or something else equally stimulating. That’s how dependence starts.

In 2007, a hallmark addiction study ranked 20 common recreational drugs on a scale of 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating greater risk of dependence. Tobacco clocked in as the third most addictive drug overall. It had a score of 2.21, beaten only by cocaine (2.39) and heroin (3.00).

However, it’s important to note that the people in the study were smoking cigarettes, which deliver a substantial 15–20 mg dose of nicotine within seconds. The large, sudden rush of nicotine lights up your pleasure pathway like a Christmas tree. Other forms of nicotine are very different. Nicotine gum, for example, releases only 2–4 mg over the course of 20–30 minutes, so you don’t get a euphoric rush from it, but you still get nicotine’s benefits.

Nicotine has a few other pitfalls:

Nicotine by itself (separate from tobacco) promotes cancer in rats [14] and mice. It also makes tumors grow faster and spread more quickly in mice. The cancer link has never shown up in human studies, so it’s hard to say whether nicotine is a cancer risk for people. Dose matters; I’m talking about very low dose, occasional targeted use in this post.

A 21 mg nicotine patch increased participants’ heart rate and blood pressure in one study.

Nicotine inhibits interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory protein, increasing inflammation.

Most importantly, nicotine is a poison at high doses. You can get really sick if you overuse it.Nicotine gum, lozenges, or leftover patches could hurt or even kill a pet or a child. Store and treat this stuff with care.

These downsides are the reason I recommend that, if you decide to use nicotine, you do it at very low dose (1–2mg), and only occasionally as needed. In 4 years of using nicotine in lozenge, patch, and inhaler form, and once an e-cig, I had absolutely zero addiction issues. I made sure not to use it daily for more than about 5 days in a row, and I didn’t use it unless I had a reason to use the extra energy.

What form of nicotine is best?

You have eight options if you want to occasionally use nicotine as a nootropic. You can smoke tobacco, chew it, use gum, spray, patches, lozenges, or the new electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). In true Bulletproof style, here’s the ordered list, from worst option to best option.

Smoking — the only upside to smoking is that it releases anatabine, a compound that suppresses autoimmune problems with the thyroid (Izabella Wentz, podcast #256, taught me that!). However, things like cancer and smelling bad make smoking a bad choice for so many reasons…

Chewing tobacco — chewing tobacco causes face cancer. Whether it’s the tobacco or the mold from curing tobacco is unclear. Tobacco mold is a major source aflatoxin B-1, an exceptionally carcinogenic mold toxin. In any case, walking around without lips isn’t worth it. There are other nootropics. Chewing tobacco also releases 3–4 times as much nicotine as smoking a cigarette does.

E-cigs (and vaping) are controversial but most people say they’re safe, although I have real concerns about nanoparticles of heavy metals from e-cig combustion chambers. You don’t want to breathe that stuff! I got a high end e-cig and tried it; it caused throat irritation and made me cough even after I tried getting used to it, so I don’t use them or recommend them. It’s way better than smoking or chewing, however.

Nicotine gum releases only 2–4 mg over the course of 20–30 minutes, so you don’t get a euphoric rush from it, but you still get nicotine’s energy benefits. Addiction to nicotine gum is possible but rare. The problem with nicotine gum is that chewing gum fires your trigeminal nerve more than it should be firing. Save your chewing for eating, and your jaw (and nervous system) will be healthier. Also, every brand of gum I’ve found has aspartame in it, often along with other questionable artificial sweeteners.

Nicotine patches are somewhere in between gum and cigarettes: they contain more nicotine than the gum does, but you absorb it through your skin slowly throughout the day so you get the focus and energy. It isn’t particularly rewarding, but your energy is higher and more stable. When I used to use patches, I’d take the smallest dose patch I could find, and cut it in half even though it says not to on the label. I’d leave it on for 1–2 hours, so I would 1–4 mg of nicotine. Jackee, our esteemed Bulletproof podcast producer, heard that I was experimenting with nicotine patches a couple years ago. She went out and bought the largest 25mg patches, and slapped one on. An hour later, she felt amazing and focused. Three hours later, she was nauseous and felt like puking, and the feeling lasted for a long time. I emphasize again that nicotine is a poison — even “used up” patches can kill small animals that eat them. You want LOW DOSE.

Nicotine inhalers are relatively hard to find. Nicorette makes these too, and they’re good because they have no chemicals at all; it’s just a sponge with nicotine, and a little plastic straw you suck through to get nicotine-scented air. I like these because they’re free of nasty chemicals, but the downside is that the act of sucking on something appears to be addictive; I found myself wanting to take a puff from one sitting on my desk when I didn’t need it. In one year, I went through maybe half a pack of inhaler refills, and many of those went stale. You use them at way lower doses than you would for quitting smoking, and it’s too easy to keep taking extra puffs.

Nicotine lozenges mostly suffer from the same problem as nicotine gum; they’re full of crappy chemicals and sweeteners like aspartame, acesulfame-potassium (Ace-K), and sucralose. The safest one I’ve found is the Nicorette mini-lozenge, which is very small, and contains no aspartame. You do get a small dose of unsafe sweetener, but it’s so tiny that it probably doesn’t matter. I take ½ of the smallest 2mg lozenge, and feel a cognitive shift in about 15 minutes. These are easy to find in the US. Go for the mini lozenges; large Nicorette lozenges are full of chemicals you don’t want.

Nicotine spray — This is a recent invention; you get about 100 sprays of 1mg each. Each spray contains vanishingly small amounts of sucralose, probably not enough to disrupt the gut biome. You spray it under your tongue and feel it quickly, making it an excellent option when you want a burst of sustained energy. I’ve done more than one interview on this — I find it’s great for jet lag or when you have a heavy day ahead of you and want to maintain focus.

In summary, here’s your list of options, from worst to best:

Smoking

Chewing tobacco

E-cigs/vaping

Nicotine gum

Nicotine patches

Nicotine inhaler

Nicotine lozenges

Nicotine mouth spray

Is nicotine valuable as a nootropic?

It all depends on how you take it. Using a lozenge or a low-dose mouth spray gives you benefits and minimize risk. Using a patch is a little bit iffier. Smoking is a disaster.

If you do decide to try nicotine, treat it carefully. A safe bet would be to take it on an ad-hoc basis. Use it if you want to be extra-sharp for a big presentation or a 3-hour meeting, but avoid taking it daily.

Happy biohacking! And seriously, don’t start smoking. It’s stupid. Don’t get sick on nicotine either; it’s dangerous. As they say, with great power comes great responsibility (at least that’s what Spiderman’s Uncle Ben said, and we *know* he was using nicotine…)

P.S. Big tobacco has done some awful stuff. Nicotine replacements are a huge improvement, but even they aren’t black and white. I have no financial relationship with tobacco or nicotine companies, although I do have a personal gardening relationship with tobacco…I grow some in my backyard to keep aphids away.

When Desperation Meets Opportunity Chapter 9 — A #NaNoWriMo 2015 Story,"Chapter 9 — Jim

Already lunch on Wednesday, and I can’t stop looking over my shoulder. Whether it is the fact that I illegally manipulated our accounting software, or that I’m hiding something that Mr. Man clearly didn’t want anyone to see, I haven’t felt safe yet this week. Sleep has been impossible the past two nights. The list of little mistakes and transposition errors has been slowly piling up this week. If I’m not careful, I may be attracting unwanted attention. I somehow have to focus.

The day to day is simply having trouble holding my attention. My brain has never been so overloaded in my life. The past two nights spent trying to piece together the information I was able to download. Questions floating through my mind. Did I execute the command correctly? Is it even the right data? How do I know he didn’t see me do it? Actually, that makes me think. If he hasn’t contacted me about that yet, it means he doesn’t know that I have the archived files from the database. If he doesn’t know that, that means he isn’t so much watching me as listening in to me. But where could he be doing that? Is my apartment bugged?

Then, it occurred to me. He knew that I spoke to Carl on the way to the park on Friday. Carl might have been in on it, some how. I still haven’t seen him. In addition, Mr. Man must have somebody in the city, at least one person, doing his bidding. After all, the money I had earned was waiting back at my apartment right after I had finished dinner with Carl. Considering all of what I know has happened so far, I can only think of one way that he’d be listening in to everything I’ve said — my phone.

I’m not sure how, and I’m not sure why, but Mr. Man must have hacked my phone in some way to keep the microphone always on. He’s always listening. That realization, even if I had somehow known he was observing me all along, makes my hair stand on end. My pocket is on fire. Every fiber of my being wants me to take the phone and chuck it right in the trash compactor.

So, I now have a second problem to solve. Knowing this information should allow me to strategically place my phone in different places so I can have private conversations. I don’t want to dump my phone, otherwise that would lead to what I’m sure would be some pretty bad consequences. My hands are mostly tied until I can learn more about who he is. Not to mention the fact that I really really like the money.

After I finished work on Monday, I returned to my apartment to see another envelope, this time with the promised fifty thousand dollars inside of it. I would be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy the money. The moral, good-boy side of me is fighting it, but to have made sixty thousand dollars in less than a week is incredible. I just hope I can survive all of this to enjoy it.

All of this thoughts have my head buzzing. It would be impossible to concentrate on my work at this point. I have to get out of here and take the rest of the day off. I need to try and sleep and think.

Nick is in his office on the far end of our floor, so I stand up and make my way down there. He is currently on the phone, and it doesn’t sound good.

“Yes, I get that. But you said you’d give us the quarter.”

“That is hardly solace for my workers.”

“You do what you need to do. If you want the gone, you come down here and tell them yourself!”

I try and stay hidden around the other side of the wall as I listen to this one side of the conversation. It would appear that my worst fears about this job are coming true. The end could be near for all of us here. Today, however, I would consider my other issues a bit larger. I need to get out of here.

Listening closely, it sounds like the conversation is over. Nick appears to make some heavy sighs, and then I hear a loud thump as his forehead connects with the desk. His devastation is obvious. For a moment, I consider walking back to my desk. But, if things are truly over soon, then really, what is the point?

I spin around and knock on his door. He picks his head up, fixes his short but carefully styled hair, and motions me in. He is trying to conjure up a smile.

“What can I do you for, Jim?”

“I’m going to level with you Nick. I’ve been having a tough week. Not sure if it is stress, or maybe some illness I don’t know about, but I haven’t slept since Sunday nght. I just have to get out of here, man. I can’t stop making stupid little mistakes. Focus is all but impossible. Is it okay if I just take the rest of the day to try and recover?”

I can tell he is thinking of what to say. It could be something about it not being a big deal because we’ll all be unemployed soon anyway. Or, he could feel his hands are tied and needs me to stay on because we are imminently done. After a few seconds, he speaks.

“WeIll, Jim, you know how important health and personal wellness is around here. Please, take the rest of the day. You’ve seemed really stressed, and I’d hate for that to continue affecting your work. We need you to be sharp, especially now. Corporate is already seeing some really bad signs from us already, and we’ve only begun the quarter. We can’t afford to let mistakes make the picture seem worse than it is.”

“I completely understand. Thank you, Nick.”

He reveals a small smile. “No problem. Rest up, and we’ll see you back here tomorrow.”

With that, I head back to my desk, pack up my things, and head out of the office and down to the street below. As has been customary since Friday, I do a quick check at street level to see if Carl is around. Still no sign of him. I’m genuinely worried that he could be hurt, or worse. Maybe Mr. Man took him out. Or, in the craziest of all possible scenarios, he wasn’t even a homeless guy, just some kind of plant by Mr. Man to see if I’d follow his instructions.

I begin my walk down Monroe towards Wabash when I notice my phone buzzing. For a moment, I panic, because the last thing I want to do is carry out another task right now. Fortunately for me, the phone call is not from him. Weirdly enough, it is from Jake at work. I debate whether or not I want to talk with anyone for a while, but then decide to answer.

“Hey man, what’s up?”

His voice scares me. “I know what you did man. You need to tell me what’s going on or I’m talking to Nick.” I’m hoping this is some kind of joke.

“Haha. Very funny Jake. Have to be honest though. I have no idea what you are talking about.” My tone hardly convinces myself I’m innocent of anything.

“Cut it Jim. We need to talk. I tried to stop by and talk to you person to person, but you had already left. You better come straight with me, or I’m going to Nick about this.” Crap. He must have been suspicious after running into me on Friday, and somehow monitored my activity. This isn’t good. The last thing I needed in all of this was a loose end. If Jake truly knows what I did, then my only option is to try and convince him to be on my side about this.

“Alright. I think this is all just a big misunderstanding, but if you come over tonight, around six or seven, after I’ve had some time to rest up, we can talk.”

“I’ll be there. I sure hope you have a good explanation. You are a good friend Jim, and I’d had to lose my faith in you over this.”

To think that my actions and my involvement in this weird game would go completely unnoticed was naive of me. As I had up Wabash Street, I try and clear my head and come up with a game plan. Knowing what I know now, maybe this isn’t a bad thing. Maybe having Jake in the fold is just what I need to figure out the mystery behind Mr. Man.",https://medium.com/when-desperation-meets-opportunity-a-nanowrimo/when-desperation-meets-opportunity-chapter-9-a-nanowrimo-2015-story-b2231981cbe3,['Josh Gauthier'],2015-11-14 03:38:09.051000+00:00,"['Fiction', 'NaNoWriMo', 'Short Story']"
Man’s Culture in Sons Eyes,"It was New Years. The Ethiopian New Years. The only reason I knew about it was because my coworker is from Ethiopia. I asked him why is he at work and not at home spending time with family and he said, “Over here you cannot really celebrate it the same way. You would want to invite friends but most of the Ethiopians over here forgot about our New Years. It’s not the same. In Ethiopia everyone is off of work, out of school, and we all gather and celebrate with food and music. It is amazing.”

The moment he started to gradually rotate his head back towards his tiring job position to continue working, you could see the pain, sadness, and yearning for a past that will never come back. You could feel the anger of a culture that is being lost in a mans eyes as he is struggling to hold on like someones sweaty hand as you dangle from a rooftop. Knowing that he will never get the money needed to go back for a simple vacation with his family and have his relatives and siblings look at him and say, “He made it,” he continues to work the same job he has had for years.

Sketchnoting Manifesto,"Held at the beautiful Autodesk Gallery overlooking San Francisco’s Ferry Building and Bay Bridge, Manifesto was an exciting Thursday afternoon for 250 product thinkers, designers, and makers in design and technology to come together to share, learn, and collaborate. With 4 keynotes and 3 panels on a spread of topics including product design, behavior design, customer retention, and disruption, the conference was the perfect opportunity for me and others from Salesforce UX to meet some inspiring folks in our field.

Between all the talks and mingling, it can sometimes be tricky to capture the content of these cool live events. Photographs don’t really say much, and videos can be too long to watch. Meanwhile, hand-scrawled notes scribbled on a page are often too cryptic or personal, and forgotten about after the fact. In light of this, I’ve actually always thought of visual note-taking as a fantastic medium for capturing live events. It’s essentially cartoon journalism: easily consumed, easily shared.

To test out my hunch, I decided to take my visual note-taking skills out for a spin during Manifesto last week. Here are my sketchnotes from some of the keynote presentations.

Thoughts on Diversity Part 2. Why Diversity is Difficult.,"I am passionate about Twitter the service, and I love Twitter, the company. The opportunity to work on a product that is positively changing how African Americans are perceived in this country is humbling. Every day for almost three years, I have looked forward to making contributions to the platform that enables #BlackLivesMatter, and that amplifies the voices of #BlackTwitter.

That is why is the public commitment by Twitter to a measurable diversity goal is so important. In 2014 27% of African American, 25% of Hispanic Americans and 21% of Women use Twitter according to Pew. Only 3% of Engineering and Product at Twitter are African American/Hispanic and less than 15% are Women. This is why the work many people have done, and continue to do in diversity at Twitter is so important. They are indomitable, have the will, strength and courage to change the story of diversity at Twitter.

Twitter SF HQ The Commons April 2015

During my time at Twitter I experienced the pride and sense of purpose on seeing #Ferguson and #blacklivesmatter on the most prominent wall at Twitter HQ. This is something I will never forget.

And yet there were moments that caused me to question how and why a company whose product has been used as an agent of revolutionary social change did not reflect the diversity of thought, conversation, and people in its ranks.

I began to understand the challenge of improving diversity when the 1st Twitter Diversity report illustrated just how much work needed to be done. This is illustrated by the fact that even tho African-Americans and Hispanics make up > 30% of Twitters (US) monthly active users, <5% make up engineering and product management combined.

There were also the Hiring Committee meetings that became contentious when I advocated for diverse candidates. Candidates who were dinged for not being fast enough to solve problems, not having internships at ‘strong’ companies and who took too long to finish their degree. Only after hours of lobbying would they be hired. Needless to say, the majority of them performed well.

Personally, a particularly low moment was having my question about what specific steps Twitter engineering was taking to increase diversity answered by the Sr. VP of Eng at the quarterly Engineering Leadership meeting. When he responded with “diversity is important, but we can’t lower the bar.” I then realized I was the only African-American in Eng leadership.

In all of this I tried to remain on the diversity sidelines, this changed in early December 2014.

Twitter sponsored an event celebrating the work of Freada Kapor Klein and the Level Playing Field Institute. The former Head of the NAACP, Ben Jealous was a featured speaker. This event was attended by many a variety of leaders in tech representing a broad cross section of races, genders, and backgrounds. However, the employee resource group representing Twitter’s black employees (@blackbirds) did not receive an invitation.

And in June of 2015, Jesse Jackson was allowed to present at the Twitter shareholder meeting. Again, there was no communication to Twitter’s black employee resource group. In comparison, when Hillary Clinton and Mellody Hobson visited, the Twitter Women Engineering resource group was notified and given an opportunity to meet privately.

Why wouldn’t there be a concerted effort to invite the few African American employees to these events? Is it because, as one colleague told me, “they forgot that you were black?” Is a prerequisite to working in tech as a minority that one is expected to, in the eyes of the majority, sublimate your racial identity to ensure a cultural fit? In attempting to achieve the appropriate level of blackness that makes me palatable to tech, had I unwittingly erased the importance of maintaining my blackness in a sea of white faces?

Each of these moments caused me to rethink what role I was playing at Twitter and in tech and how I could participate in dismantling what I describe as the diversity problem in tech. I want to be a leader in eliminating environments where I am the only African American in engineering leadership.

But then, in August 2015, Jack Dorsey returned to Twitter, and during a company meeting, responded to my question about committing Twitter to a measurable diversity goal. He publicly committed to diversity in front of every Twitter employee in attendance, and a few short weeks later, Twitter publishes this. And in a profoundly emotional moment, Jack Dorsey plays the video below at the next company meeting:

This epitomizes the best of Twitter, and I left the meeting inspired and ready to drive the bus of diversity in engineering.

After several weeks of meetings and guidance acceptance from Executive Staff, I pitch a job proposal to focus on increasing diversity in engineering to the Sr. VP of Eng. In the course of the meeting, he suggests that we begin tracking the ethnicity of potential candidates in the pipeline to understand better where candidates are falling out. I agreed that this is an important metric to track and conveyed that the current data we had indicated that the problem is not just the pipeline. While ethnic and gender data early in the pipeline is incomplete, we do know that in 2013, 4.5% of CS graduates from the top 25 schools were African-American, and 6.5% were Hispanic/Latino.

As we continued the discussion, he suggested I create a tool to analyze candidates last names to classify their ethnicity. His rationale was to track candidates thru the pipeline to understand where they were falling out. He made the argument that the last name Nguyen, for example, has an extremely high likelihood of being Vietnamese. As an engineer, I understand this suggestion and why it may seem logical. However, classifying ethnicity's by name is problematic as evidenced by my name (Leslie Miley) What I also found disconcerting is this otherwise highly sophisticated thinker could posit that an issue this complex could be addressed by name analysis. (For reference, here is a tool that attempts to do that. With Jewish or African/African Americans, this classifier scored 0% on identifying these groups in Twitter engineering). While not intentional, his idea underscored the unconscious tendency to ignore the complex forces of history, colonization, slavery and identity.

I left that meeting wondering how I could, in good conscience, continue to work in an organization where the Sr. VP of Engineering could see himself as a technology visionary and be so unaware of this blind spot in his understanding of diversity. Leadership keeps citing the pipeline when the data does not support it. They continue to churn out ethnic and racial minorities and women but still claim a commitment to diversity.

Twitter SF HQ The Commons Aug 2015

This is the last meeting of any consequence I had at Twitter. My time at Twitter is over. And I end it very conflicted. Twitter as a platform has empowered underserved and underrepresented people. It has fomented social movements and brought to the forefront of American media and politics issues that impact me personally and professionally.

Twitter’s issues with growth and engagement and the issues with internal diversity are somewhat related. The over-reliance on a limited number of schools and workplaces for talent has caused a type of group think to dominate. Any change would be approved by people who all think alike. There was very little diversity in thought and almost no diversity in action. To quote Mark S. Luckie “Without a variety of voices contributing ideas, the workplace becomes a homogenized environment where potential brilliance may never be achieved. Diversity should rightly be seen as a benefit to growth, not an obstruction to avoid.” For some at Twitter, diversity is an obstruction to avoid. With my departure, Twitter no longer has any managers, directors, or VP’s of color in engineering or product management. From this position, Twitter may find it difficult to make the changes to culture and product.

The return of Jack Dorsey has the potential to change the diversity trajectory for Twitter. It is my belief that Jack understands the use case of Twitter better than anyone else, understands how diversity can be additive to growth, and is committed to making that happen. The leadership that Jack is showing has been long missing from Twitter and tech. His belief in the team, his belief in what is right for Twitters users and not in building a 100 billion dollar company is what’s been missing.

I did the best work of my career at Twitter. And this was possible mainly because of the incredible people who believed in each other. To my friends, co-workers, and associates, Qapla’!

With Hardship Comes Ease Review,"Inspirited Minds strikes again with another fab event that left some speechless, intrigued, and motivated to know more about themselves, addictions that we may be oblivious to, the realm of the unseen, and dealing with anxiety and depression — this time, in the form of an epic 2 day workshop.

Day 1

What better way to start the day than introducing yourself, to yourself, with Ramiz Ibrahim. It lead to many individuals taking a leap onto their journey of self-discovery. Everyone thinks they know themselves, but the attendees soon realised that they were their own strangers. Brother Ramiz had us think about our boundaries and limits that stop us from becoming the better us that we want to become, because we all want to improve and ultimately secure our places up top. However, as we all struggle with the daily battle against our nafs and other elements, we must know how to get over these hurdles — and that’s exactly what we were exploring. Underlying our daily hurdles is our resistance to change.

Why is there a resistance to change? Our ego. This is why we were taught to humble ourselves, remember our purpose and question if we were fulfilling that, remind ourselves that there is no harm in learning from our mistakes for betterment in the future, and be open to adaption and adjustment which are fundamental for progression and moving forward. In order to get to location B, we need to know where we are at with A and what path we need to take. We need to find ourselves, our true selves, who we really are, we need to understand and co-operate with our own mind, our emotions, our thoughts and how we change in situations in order for real and permanent change to be implemented.

“Most people dream about their lives, but do not live it. Stop dreaming, it’s time to live your life.” Ramiz Ibrahim

Have you ever wondered how awful it must be to want to change, but not know how to? Sister Nazish Hussain talked us through the processes, the consequences and the ‘background info’ to addictions that we all seem to ignore. It is our duty as Muslims to be empathic and non-judgemental, because we’re all struggling with something, whether it is with picking up the Quran once a day, drinking far too much green tea, swearing, smoking, gambling, drugs or even social media, we’re all struggling. Sister Nazish highlighted that we have to be the good company that people need, “with our scarves and beards, we cannot judge. We have to acknowledge responsibility”, and have to imagine how we would react, respond and treat the person who has come to us for help or needs help, if they were a loved one?

Sister Nazish effortlessly put it all into perspective and made us realise that there is a lot more to addictions than what we think, the roots, the cause, the strong feeling of need, the need for control, and so on, it’s a vicious cycle that would break down even the most strongest of people. Many would focus on their sinning (if we’re talking about gambling and substance use addictions), but we were asked to knock down the barrier we instantly put up, causing an “us” and “them” partition because it is against Islam. We fail to realise that something must have been missing in order to prevent their connection with Islam, something must have affected their spirituality that caused them to fill it with something else. We cannot go in guns blazing when trying to help, or be too hard for trying to deal with struggles, be sensitive to the chaos going on in someone’s life — as their struggle does not define their existence.

“They are not an addict; they are person with an addiction. We have to hate the problem, and not the person.” Nazish Hussain

Day 2

The second day started bright and early with jinns, black magic, and mental illness… Okay, it’s not as heavy as it sounds. Brother Abu Taher cleared a path for us to begin delving into the unseen influences by firstly highlighting how complex the relationship is between jinns, black magic, symptoms and the effect it has on our mental health. I believe most attendees went into the workshop believing that they would be able to put jinn possessions and mental illness into 2 different boxes, but we realised that the unseen world, parallel to us, is in fact more intertwined than what we thought. Brother Abu Taher had us examine case studies where certain people had illnesses and we had to conclude whether or not it was a jinn possession/black magic or whether they could be clear cut diagnosed with a mental health disorder — but it wasn’t as easy as that, and most of the times we found ourselves with a combined answer, demonstrating how mixed it is. Many misconceptions were cleared up from goat feet, to wolves’ kryptonite, but most importantly a clear distinction was made between black magic and jinn possession. These are commonly mixed up, which can often lead to misdiagnosis and further trauma.

Black magic are the symptoms of jinn possession let’s say, and jinn possession is when the mind and body has actually been taken over by an external force. Therefore, if someone is doing something out of character or they are acting unusual, or they have been feeling in some way for a period of time — we can’t jump to the conclusion that they are possessed, nor can we say that they must have had black magic done on them, as the symptoms can be very similar to other mental health disorders such as mania, hallucinations, hysteria, depression, erratic thinking etc. It was brought to our attention what Jinn’s actually are, where they live and how there are good and bad jinns just like us, who will also be held accountable and how black magic comes about — just think typical scary movies. (Who knew they would take such inspiration?) We were given duas to take home which can aid in protecting ourselves from such situations, as dua is the weapon of the believer. Although symptoms may appear to be intertwined, and that could be a reason of why mental illness is so easily blamed on unseen influences, we have to remember that mental health and jinns/black magic are acknowledged as independent in Islam, as it should be in today’s community.

“Verily we created man from a wet product of earth” [23:12] “& He created Jinns from smokeless fire” [55:15]

What comes prior to anxiety and depression? Sister Aaliyah Shaikh suggested what happens before the beginning, where potential causes of depression and anxiety take place, in the womb. When we’re young and healthy, what we put inside our bodies is for ourselves, but when there is another human growing inside us — it is different story. Harsh toxins and chemicals, not just in the air but in our food can expose stress to the embryo, we are all aware it is for the health of the child — but have we ever thought about the effects it may have on the mental health? In the last few stages of the pregnancy, where in some cases the baby has to be forced out of the womb can cause anxiety and depression at a very early stage in the life — but more externally, sister Aaliyah pointed out the fact that pregnancy is almost seen like an illness. Where pregnant women are expected to take on the sick role and end up being treated in hospital, where everything from the environment, to the machines to the uniform can set off alarm bells in the mind and cause the body stress and anxiety. We started to question society’s way of dealing with a natural process of life.

Our brain structure can be moulded by the events we experience, thus “children who experience maternal depression early in life may suffer from lasting effects on their brain architecture and persistent disruptions of their stress response systems”. This lead to an intense discussion on medicalisation, and politics of health and treatments, are we really getting what we’re asking for? The discussion sparked new and comprehensive ideas for a health care system that doesn’t involve GP’s having patients on conveyor belts, rather a more positive outlook on health with gratitude in all aspects. There is a lot of pain and suffering in every individual, and we all have degrees of unwellness, but it is our naivety and ignorance that needs to change in order to expose the true causes of suffering. Everything about us depends on our emotional and psychological wellbeing, and it is when we create boxes for our human aspects that it becomes labelled and uncommon to have an illness that nobody can see or touch. We are whole, not a body and mind made up of individual components. With that said, Sister Aaliyah gave us super beneficial pointers on how to stay healthy on a ‘whole’, from our food and nutrition, to sleep, to having regular routines, to moving, to being aware of our environment but most importantly recognising our intentions and realising our purpose. We need to have a peaceful meaning, to have a peaceful mind.",https://medium.com/inspirited-minds/with-hardship-comes-ease-review-52283d5fa4dd,['Inspirited Minds'],2015-12-06 00:27:49.650000+00:00,"['Mental Health', 'Islam', 'Quran']"
After the Fall,"My wife’s world has turned upside down. Last week, I came home to find her standing on the ceiling, drinking coffee.

“Come down this minute,” I said, but she didn’t.

She eats up there, sleeps up there. I tell her that I cannot possibly have every conversation with my neck lobbed back, that it’s uncomfortable, but she stays up there anyway.

Today, she is sitting at her computer and typing. She has brought a chair up there and a desk too. She has a mattress and pillows, sheets and blankets. She put a ladder against the wall of the bedroom so she can get up and down freely. We have quite a tall ceiling, so she needed one of those industrial ladders, the kind the painters use when they need to reach the roof.

“Are you having lunch?” I ask.

“Maybe,” she says, not looking down.

“I will not have this,” I say, “I will not have this at all.”

“I’m working,” she says.

At first, I thought it was a phase, maybe some kind of sickness or something. I asked the doctor, and he said this happens sometimes, after something like this. “It’s normal,” he said, “don’t worry.” But it has been almost five weeks now, and she has not come down for longer than it takes to use the restroom or take a shower.

In the beginning, I asked her nicely, kindly, in a way I thought might make a difference. “I understand,” I told her, “but please come down.”

“I can’t,” she said.

“Why not?”

“It gives me a headache. My ears ring.”

“That is ridiculous,” I said, but she just shook her head.

I go into the kitchen and start fixing sandwiches. After a few minutes, I hear her above me.

“I’d prefer no mayo,” she says, shuffling her feet.

“Then come down here and make it yourself.”

I finish her sandwich and hand it up to her. I have to stand on the counter to be able to reach. She grabs it and shuffles back into the bedroom.

“Wash your feet,” I yell. There are smudges all over the ceiling. I see them at night when I lie in bed, tread marks of oil and dirt.

The television is gone by the afternoon.

“You cannot have that,” I tell her.

“Why not? I want to watch.”

“Then come down here.”

“You don’t understand,” she says.

“Try me.”

“You’re still down there.”

“What else can I do?”

“You could come up here.”

“How?”

“Just try.”

I try. I can’t. I climb up the ladder but I’m afraid to step off.

“I’ll fall,” I say.

“No, you won’t,” she says, “look at me.” She demonstrates, swinging onto the ladder above me and back off again.

“Here goes,” I say, but when I do the same thing I fall, straight to the ground.

“Are you okay?” she asks, looking down.

“No,” I say, looking up. My wrist is throbbing, my leg is in pain. We look at each other, our foreheads squished, our faces distorted. “Come down.”

“I told you, it makes me sick.”

“You make me sick.”

“Then don’t look up.”

I hear her walk into the bedroom. She comes out dragging something, probably her mattress.

“It shouldn’t have been like this,” I say. I am not sure she hears. I am not sure she is still in the room.

****

We stop speaking, almost entirely. The ceiling becomes littered. Old socks and dishes. Newspapers, breadcrumbs. Papers everywhere. A few weeks later, one of them drifts down. I pick it up and turn it over. A name, scrawled in the top left corner.

“I’m starting to forget,” I tell her that night. She is in the living room lying on her mattress. I look up and can see the outline of her torso through the blankets, the curve of her breasts, the shape of her hips. It is odd to me that her body looks the same, that she hasn’t changed up there, mutated or something.

“What?”

“Everything.”

“Oh.”

“Is it better up there?” I ask.

“I don’t know,” she says.

“Yes, you do.”

“How could it be?”

I walk from the living room into the bedroom. I leave the door open. She follows inside. I lie down on the bed. She lies down on the ceiling. We are exactly opposite. I can see her features perfectly. Unlike her body, her face looks older. I want to reach up and touch her, put my palms on either side of her face, and hold her head in my hands.

“I miss him,” I say, “but I miss you, too.”

She reaches out her hand, and I do the same. Our fingers don’t touch; there is too much space, but the intention comforts me. Then she drops her hand, takes a deep breath, and gets out of bed. She goes over to the ladder and climbs down.

“Okay,” she says, when her feet are on the floor. She gets in bed next to me.

“How do you feel?” I ask.

“Fine.”

“Really?”

“Let’s sleep,” she says. She curls into the fetal position, tucking her knees tightly into her chest. I put a hand on her cheek and run it down her neck. She brushes me away and lifts the pillow out from underneath her head. “Goodnight,” she says, and turns over.

The next morning, when I wake up, she is already out of bed. Immediately, my eyes dart to the ceiling, but she is not there. I keep my neck in my hands as I make my way into the living room. I am so focused on the ceiling—her discarded blankets, the same shape as the day before—that I knock right into her. She is standing in the kitchen, making eggs.

“Good morning,” she says.

“You’re here,” I say.

She smiles and rubs her forehead, motioning for me to take a seat at the counter. “Do you want toast?” she asks.

“Okay.”

We eat in silence. It takes her a long time to finish her food. She keeps coughing and scratching her neck.

“What should we do today?” I ask. I take our plates and stack them in the dishwasher. I cannot remember whether the others are dirty, but I run them all anyway.

“I’m kind of tired,” she says, “I may just go lie down.” I notice that her face is red. It looks swollen, filled, ready to explode.

“You’re sick,” I say.

“Maybe,” she says.

“Come on,” I say.

She gets into bed, and I lay a cool compress on her head. I take two pillows and stack them under her feet.

“Thanks,” she says, quietly.

In the afternoon, it is worse. Her face is sweating, her hands and feet white.

“Go back up there,” I say.

“It’s okay,” she says, eyes closed.

“You have to,” I say, “or you will die down here.”

She shakes her head.

“I’m sorry,” I say.

“For what?” she asks.

“That it’s like this,” I say, “that we’ve ended up here.”

“It’s not your fault,” she says, reaching for my hand. She takes it to her cheek, which is so hot that I think it might burn my skin.

“We should have done something differently,” I say.

“How could we?” she says, whispering.

I help her out of bed and up the ladder. I hoist her onto the ceiling, see the blood drain out of her head, down her neck. I see her wiggle her fingers, stretch her arms.

“I’ll go,” I say.

She nods and opens her mouth, but no words materialize.

I start packing my stuff immediately, dragging the two trunks out of the closet and filling them. It seems ridiculous to leave; there isn’t even a reason to, and it’s not as if we share this house anymore. I wish she could go on living up there and I could go on living down here. I remember what it was like to have her down here. To watch her picking up the toys, turning off the lights. The memory is too much, but it is for precisely this reason she will never leave.

I close the trunks in the living room and walk back into the bedroom. I can hear her up there, typing softly. She stops when I stop. We are both silent, still, our breathing like a harmony, one note on top of the other.

“Please,” I say. I offer this word up like a prayer.

I drop to the floor in supplication, placing my head on the hardwood, my palms flat. I am not sure whether I am expressing sorrow or hope. With my head still pressed to the ground, I hear her move above me. I know without looking that she is prostrating herself, too. We lie like this: I am on the floor, and she, is on the ceiling. Both on the ground, like children.",https://humanparts.medium.com/after-the-fall-5a101e5d03fd,['Human Parts'],2015-02-28 13:26:46.110000+00:00,"['Fiction', 'Relationships', 'Prose']"
StreetScore,"By Nikhil Naik, Camera Culture

What makes a neighborhood look safe, lively, or depressing? And how does a city’s appearance affect the health and behavior of its residents? We can’t answer these questions with census data alone; we need quantitative tools that can measure the visual appearance of a city. StreetScore, a project by the Camera Culture and Macro Connections groups at the Media Lab, is a tool that measures how safe a street view looks to a human — but using a computer.

By using StreetScore to measure the visual perception of safety of hundreds of thousands of street views from Google Maps, we can generate high-resolution maps which show how safe different neighborhoods of a city appear. These data can help us explore important connections between the appearance of urban environments, crime, and health. Dig a little deeper, and these visualizations can give us valuable information about the history of a city’s architecture, planning, and policies.

How StreetScore Works

StreetScore is a machine learning algorithm. It learned to predict how safe an image looks by using many example images labeled by people as safe or unsafe. This data consisted of 3,000 street views from New York and Boston, obtained from another Media Lab project called Place Pulse, launched by the Macro Connections group in 2011.

From Place Pulse to StreetScore

Place Pulse can be thought of as a “hot or not” game for street views: people are presented with a pair of images and asked to click on the one they think looks safer, or more lively, or more beautiful. The throughput of Place Pulse, however, is limited. Even though online participation can give us hundreds of thousands of clicks, this throughput does not allow us to scale to millions of images. To scale we need train a computer to predict how a human will perceive a picture of a street. So how do we train a computer to do this?

To begin the training, we first needed to convert the pairwise comparisons from 3,000 images scored by Place Pulse to image rankings, in much the same way golf players are arranged on a leaderboard as first, second, and so on. We created this leaderboard using the Microsoft TrueSkill ranking algorithm, and scored each image on a scale from 0 to 10. Next, we used “image features” to describe these images. An image feature is an abstract representation of an image that encodes information on the colors, textures, and shapes present in the image. In other words, image features try to quantify things like the greenness of the grass, roughness of the bricks, and pointiness of the roof.

Using the 3,000 examples of street views from PlacePulse, we developed a predictor, or a set of rules, that quantify the contribution of different image features on the perception of safety. We called this trained predictor “StreetScore.” The training enables StreetScore to evaluate new images. It extracts image features from an image and assigns the complete image a score based on the associations between features and scores learned from the training dataset. In our paper, we show that StreetScore does a good job of predicting the perceived safety of the areas shown in the new images, meaning that we can use it to generate relatively accurate maps of the appearance of different cities.

From Algorithm to Visualizations

Once we had a working algorithm, the next step was to create interactive map visualizations based on the thousands of street views evaluated by StreetScore. Jade Philipoom, an MIT undergrad studying electrical engineering and computer science, joined the project as an undergraduate researcher (UROP) to work on the visualizations. She did a great job setting up the pipeline for generating the maps—work that allowed the team to look at different visualizations and make important design decisions. She was then able to incorporate these changes and create the beautiful maps you now see on the website.

Key Insights and Next Steps

This project is at the intersection of a few disparate research areas, namely computer vision, urban science, and data visualization, and we gained key insights in these different fields while working on StreetScore.

On the urban planning side, we want to follow up on a few other ideas that came up. First, we are planning to use StreetScore to study how neighborhoods evolve over time using street views captured at different times. Second, we want to use StreetScore to study the segregation of urban environments due to different urban planning decisions. We’ll post examples of our findings on the StreetScore website. Our data are also being used by different urban planning and economics researchers studying similar questions.

From a computer-vision perspective, it was great to see that there is potential to aggregate information obtained by an algorithm from millions of images to generate meaningful insights about this image collection. As big visual data becomes common in social media, urban planning, public health, entertainment, and many other fields, computer-vision algorithms that can synthesize information from troves of visual data will become important. We are excited to work on algorithms and applications for this fast-developing field. We’re also very interested to see new applications of StreetScore and follow-up projects by researchers, companies, and other users.",https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/streetscore-1b8f846ff13d,['Mit Media Lab'],2015-12-02 19:34:59.279000+00:00,"['Research', 'Data Visualization', 'Technology']"
The day my life story went viral,"This is the introduction to my book, The Internet is My Religion, which is available now in paperback, and can also be shared for free online because internet.

I’d just flown into New York. I was staying at a random stranger’s apartment near NYU that I’d found through Airbnb after Facebook informed me that we had three mutual friends. The wi-fi password was not on a sticky note in the kitchen like it was supposed to be. I texted the owner, but she didn’t know what the password was. Why was this not a big deal? If the water wasn’t working, that would be a crisis, but I could do without a shower before I could do without internet!

I was a little high strung. Crazy nervous, really. In two days I would be giving the most important speech of my life. Standing in front of 800 of the most influential political and technology professionals in the world, I was going to tell a deeply personal story about religion that I wasn’t even sure I could get through without crying. I had no idea how they would react, and I was terrified that I’d be booed off the stage.

The morning of the Personal Democracy Forum, I sat between Ben Rattray from Change.org and Jay Rosen from NYU in the first row as I waited for my turn to speak. It felt like I was the only person in the entire room not staring at a glowing screen. Instead, I was staring at the floor reciting the speech over and over again in my head. Then three friends — Lea, Ramin, and Jesse — walked in and sat behind me. They were the only ones who knew what I was about to do

Micah Sifry, the conference organizer and a great friend, called me to the stage. I repeated the first line of the speech in my head, Growing up I had two loves: Jesus and the internet. And then I started.

In the Christian faith, giving one’s testimony about how Jesus saved your life is the necessary rite of passage. It’s the personal story of transformation that spreads the Good News from person to person, one by one, to every corner of the earth. These stories of faith in Christ formed the basis for the infrastructure behind the most powerful movement in human history. So on that day, I shared my struggle with faith, my story of transformation, my testimony — with a twist.

Towards the end, people started clapping. I waited, but then everyone kept clapping and started standing up! It was the last thing I expected. I finally got my head together and motioned that I had one more thing to say, just one more thing.

When I finished, the place erupted again. I had managed not to cry, just barely. But, looking around the room, it seemed like others hadn’t. Completely exhausted, totally overwhelmed, and fully unable to process what was happening, I snuck out through the side entrance of the auditorium. A couple people from the audience ran after me. More people kept coming, but my friends finally found me and steered me away. Alone, we stared at each other in disbelief.

“What just happened?!”

“Um … I think you just started a religion.”

“Oh my God, I forgot this was being livestreamed.”

And then Ramin asked, “Did you see Twitter?” That got everyone’s attention.

There were thousands of tweets.

Within a couple days, the video had been seen 300,000 times and I had a major publisher offer me a $100,000 book deal. Agents were crawling all over me. They told me I could sell my story for a million dollars if I wanted and there would be a hundred copies in every bookstore.

But what no one knew was that Lea and I had been working on a book for over a year. It was through that process with her that I’d come to discover what I really believed, and why I knew — and knew I had to tell — my story.

I was an activist and a geek. I saw my strength as building technology infrastructure for leaders and had just started a new company, NationBuilder, to do exactly that. But I’d learned about the power of stories while producing documentaries. The stories we tell create our culture. They illuminate our worldviews. It took me a long time to accept that possibly the most important thing I could offer wasn’t something I would build, but was simply telling my story.

I believe that there is a new worldview. One based on internet values and the connectedness of all humanity — where instead of waiting for a savior, we create the future. And I now know that I’m not the only one who feels this way.

I turned down the book deals and told the agents to go away. We’re publishing this on the internet, for free. For this story, there really is no other way. I have faith that you will share it with your friends, family, and community — that’s the only way it will exist in the world. But most importantly, I hope that you will share your own story, your testimony, your faith in what’s possible when God just happens.",https://medium.com/galleys/the-day-my-life-story-went-viral-4f5fb96ee854,['Jim Gilliam'],2015-08-13 19:27:35.735000+00:00,"['Storytelling', 'Religion', 'Internet']"
What I Learned About Money in My Twenties,"by S.L. Bathgate

I’m 30. By virtue of that fact, I should be qualified enough to tell you about how to get your finances in order during your twenties. Luckily for you, I am not going to dole out the same tired financial advice that you’ve heard time and again. I bet you already know all the “right” things you are supposed to do with your money. And there are probably a lot of reasons why you’re not doing them. But what I will tell you is that you’ve got to figure out why you spend (or don’t spend) money if you’re going to start solving your own financial woes.

Everyone has his or her own very personal and unique relationship with money. Looking back on my twenties, I realized that I spent my money mainly because I wanted to feel richer than I actually was. This single desire was probably the most fundamental problem I had with money during my twenties, and admittedly, it is one that I still struggle with today.

My parents were small business owners who worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week. We weren’t poor, but we definitely went without things found in most family households, most notably, cable television and an abundance of toys. Knowing how hard my parents worked, I decided that I would have to rise above my upbringing and make the best of it. I traded in my dreams of going to a small Northeast liberal arts college for a free ride at a nearby state university. While in school, I supported myself on waitressing tips until well after I graduated.

I got my first office job in my early twenties, complete with a paltry, yet steady, salary. Suddenly, I was hungry to experience the full spectrum that life had to offer, and all too eager to ignore the wide disparity between my means and aspirations. It was still a time when everything in the world seemed novel, and by virtue of its novelty, was mandatory to experience. Bottomless mimosa brunches? Buying that $200 used guitar on a whim? Impromptu road trips? Yes, yes and yes.

I knew I shouldn’t have been spending my money so liberally, but for the first time, it felt like a relief to just have the nice things that always seemed missing from my life. Somehow, it seemed perfectly fine to drop at least $200 a month on sushi dinners, to purchase designer handbags, to drink endless rounds of American craft beers, and to have and to hold each new Apple product in my hands.

As I marched towards 30, I had desperately wanted to bid farewell to my purely middle class upbringing, as I had been seduced by the fantasy of a more beautiful and perfect life. I started to swap out my particleboard furniture for something with clean mid-century modern lines, and leather upholstery. I bought brand new suits at retail price, at around $400 a pop, because I subscribed to the cheesy adage of dressing for the job I wanted, not the one I had. I longed for French cookware, said yes to happy hours that lasted until midnight, and snapped up luxuriously scented (and priced) organic shampoos, because I wanted it all, and didn’t want to wait.

As the years went by, I felt as though the wage gap between my peers and myself was growing wider, and I wanted to pretend that it wasn’t. I was still struggling to find a decent paying job, while others seemed to be steadily advancing in their careers. There were little hints to suggest that my life was not as finely appointed as those of my friends’, like when I still carried a flip phone when everyone else had smartphones, or when I still drank milk chock full of artificial hormones instead of organic milk that cost twice as much. But in all honesty, I didn’t really know much about the state of my friends’ personal finances, as discussions of money were (and to a certain extent, still are) the ultimate taboo.

When I actually took the time to look through my crumpled receipts and credit card statements, I got mad at myself. Why had I paid almost $40 just to eat breakfast at a restaurant? How did I drop $140 on cosmetics alone in the prior month? Did I really want to pay nearly $80 a month for the privilege of doing yoga poses in a room heated to 100 degrees — if I went to Bikram yoga class at all? Whatever my reasons were, they just weren’t worth it in the end.

It was clear that I had refused to live within my means, and I needed to do something to change my situation. On one too many occasions, I had ransacked my short-lived savings to pay off mounting credit card bills. I still had an array of credit cards I had accumulated during my early twenties while playing the balance transfer game. And my credit score had taken a sizeable hit.

By some twisted logic, I decided to borrow six very big figures to get rich. At the time, I believed that I could become financially set for life if I went back to school to become a lawyer. My then-boyfriend (now husband) was reluctant of that proposition, given the expense. When I enrolled in law school, we both understood that it would be up to me to repay my student loan debt. As I approached graduation from law school, I went numb when I realized exactly how much student loan debt I had accrued, and how terrible my job prospects were. (This was after 2008, when the economy tanked and law firms basically stopped hiring.)

At 29, I had reached the most financially vulnerable moment in my life: I had no permanent job prospects, no savings and no way of knowing how I would begin to pay back my federal student loans. Even though I was married and had a supportive husband, I had never felt more unstable in my life. It contrasted starkly to how I began my twenties, back when I had no credit card or student loan debts. I could have been one of the smart ones, those sound individuals who amass a small fortune by my age, instead of spoiling myself. The sense of regret and fear was enough to wake me up from my decade-long denial.

Eventually, I was lucky enough to find a full-time job that not only paid the bills, but allowed me to save a little bit. As for my federal student loans, I had consolidated them and entered into an Income-Based Repayment Plan, which I wholeheartedly admit has been the saving grace of my life, making it far more affordable for me to pay back my debts. I paid off all of my credit card balances, and actually have the makings of an emergency fund. I scrupulously record my expenses every day, stick to a budget and always try to come up with new ways to reduce my spending. Most of these, of course, are very basic things I always knew how to do, even back when I was just 20 years old. It still surprises me that I spent the past decade squandering my earnings on my fleeting desires to feel rich, when deep down I knew exactly what I needed to do to build wealth.

In retrospect, I’ve come up with some new goals for my thirties. I am going to contribute at least 10 percent of my salary towards my retirement. I am going to chip away at my student loan debt until it is paid off or forgiven, whichever one comes first. I am going to embrace the very simple concept that I must spend less than I earn. And I am going to be richer than I have ever been in my entire life. But you already knew that, didn’t you?

How to Prevent New York from Becoming the Bitcoin Backwater of the U.S.,"Digital currency is “one of the most promising emerging technologies for the next 10 years,” according to Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab. More than $600 million has been invested by venture capitalists in startups building on bitcoin and related digital currencies. Additionally, companies like UBS, IBM, and Intel have established labs to identify opportunities to leverage digital currency.

Bitcoin, and the underlying technology, blockchain, let people transfer money without a bank. It also allows them to write simple, enforceable contracts without a lawyer, or, turn physical items like real estate or tickets to the ball game or concert into digital assets that can be sold with low to no transaction fees.

Many are projecting that the impact of digital currencies will be similar to that of the Internet–disrupting traditional industries, challenging existing regulations, and significantly increasing the volume of commerce by dramatically lowering the cost to transact and establishing trust between two previously unknown parties.

Like any emerging technology, it is still unclear exactly how Bitcoin and other crytpocurrencies should be regulated.

If regulation is done right, it will increase investment in digital currency startups, create jobs and allow consumers to receive cutting-edge financial services of the future, faster and safer.

This month, the superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), Benjamin Lawsky, is expected to issue a new regulation called BitLicense. The goals for issuing the BitLicense include protecting consumers from fraud and preventing money laundering and other illicit uses of cryptocurrencies.

However, because the NYDFS is the bellwether for financial regulation, the rules it creates, good or bad, could be replicated by the majority of states in America. If replicated, Bitcoin companies will face substantial regulatory burdens and only a handful of the most well-funded companies will survive— not because of the best product or service, but because they have access to the most money.

My goal in writing this post is to share with Superintendent Lawsky, his hardworking staff, and the public, what I believe to be the four critical flaws of the BitLicense and the unintended consequences the regulation will likely create.",https://medium.com/mit-media-lab-digital-currency-initiative/how-to-prevent-new-york-from-becoming-the-bitcoin-backwater-of-the-u-s-931505a54560,['Brian Forde'],2015-05-14 12:27:14.612000+00:00,['Bitcoin']
How we kick-started our sales funnel.,"One thing at a time.

Justin Grossman . June 24, 2015

Many entrepreneurs believe, “build it and they will come.” Meaning you can put up a cool, well-designed website or an app and it will go viral when millions of people flock to it.

While there are a few anomalies out there, most new products and apps do not strike gold right away. When building Talu, we didn’t kid ourselves about customers showing up on day one. Our goal was to receive valuable feedback to improve the app. We launched Private Beta by invitation only, our first users were friends, business associates and family. After taking their feedback and making subtle changes, we launched public beta, with a multi-pronged approach.

Step 1: Marketing Site — Basic Messaging and App Demo

After launching our marketing site, we spent time reviewing and refining messaging. We had been too close to the app and needed to take a step back with help from the outside. During the proccess, we made sure our CTA’s were clear and set up Google Events for beta signups, this allowed us to measure how our CTA’s were performing. The last item we added to the marketing site was a real-time demo with our company’s report. There is no better way to show what your product does than showcasing your own authentic data to the world.

Step 2: Basic SEO

We started making some noise on social media and used various URLs with Talu keywords to link back to our site.

The second phase of SEO was creating mini sites populated with Talu methodology and content (whitepapers, infographics, etc.). These sites redirect and link back to our marketing site. The goal of these mini sites is to use industry related non-biased content to appear as experts in our field and quickly build our SEO prescene.

We were also in an Arizona startup competition, Venture Madness. We ended up making it to the final rounds of the March Madness style competition and received several linkbacks from well established news and business sites like Phoenix Business Journal, Arizona Republic and an Inc. Magazine blog article.

Through this proccess we heard people had difficulty finding our marketing site and became aware it was burried on page six of Google Search. We used a small spend on Adwords to buy ‘Talu” as a keyword to help people find us more easliy. We went from being buried, to #1 on the first page of Google. Not bad!

These efforts, along with adding content to our site, helped get us our first visitors and become optimized on search.

Step 3: Paid Advertising Testing

While we were waiting on our SEO efforts to start kicking in, we ran paid ad testing to help accelerate signups and increase exposure. During a two week period, we used $800 across Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Adwords-search and display networks. Although this is a small chunk of change, we saw what worked and what didn’t relatively quickly.

We used KISSmetrics and Google custom tracking URLs to measure the conversion rate for beta signups on our marketing site. With A/B testing several different images and copy we found what spoke to our target audience and where the cost per aquisition was most cost effective, allowing us to get more users for less money. We took what worked and setup a monthly campaign with the remaining budget.

The Results

Our beta strategy for the marketing site took us from 58 new visitors in the first month to 772 visitors in the 2nd month, and 984 visitors in the third month. By that time we were also on first page of Google, as mentioned above. Our traffic continues to grow steadily, along with new users.

While there is still a chance we might get lucky and go viral, we will continue working hard to grow our pipeline the old fashioned way; One thing (aka, marketing tactic) at a time.",https://medium.com/talu-app/how-we-kick-started-our-sales-funnel-6d4c642d55a3,['Justin Grossman'],2015-08-25 21:37:44.521000+00:00,"['SEO', 'SaaS', 'Marketing']"
Connecting the IoT and Your C-Suite,"Modern technology is like toddler; it’s quick, it’s imaginative, it’s always growing and changing, and if you turn your head, you might lose track of it. In today’s fast-paced market, no company can take the wait-and-see approach to innovation. The key to keeping or expanding your market share is getting ahead of the latest trends, and right now, no trend has more potential than the Internet of Things.

As you likely know, the Internet of Things is the network of sensor-laden physical devices that communicate with other hardware and software via the Internet. What you may not know is there will be 20 to 30 billion devices connected to the Internet by 2020. This includes the smartphone in your pocket, the tablet in your briefcase, the computer on your desk, and thousands of things that haven’t been invented yet.

If executives want to turn this opportunity into profit, they’re going to have to understand not just how the IoT works, but it’s value — and fast.

What Do You Have to Lose?

In short, revenue. According to McKinsey & Company, the IoT is projected to generate $11.1 trillion a year in economic value by 2025, with $5 trillion coming exclusively from B2B settings. From consumer-facing retailers to manufacturers, every company stands to benefit from the Internet of Things.

The problem? Most businesses have yet to realize the potential:

Over 50% of business leaders had no plans to pursue or implement IoT technology

Only 32% of business leaders were taking any steps toward IoT connectivity

But brands are starting to catch up:

Forrester reports that 50% of North American companies of 250+ employees are increasing technology budgets over the next 12 months, and

49% of business decision makers consider the expansion of IoT initiatives a “high” or “critical” priority over the next 12 months

If your executive team requires convincing before investing in IoT, now is the time to introduce them to the basics, including:

How IoT is making an impact across industries

The business risks of delaying or ignoring implementation of IoT technology

How to begin incorporating IoT into product roadmaps

Are you sold on the value of IoT, but need a little help perfecting your pitch? Read on to learn how to win executive buy-in for your proposal.

Step 1: Teach Executives the Basics of IoT Technology

Despite what some executives may believe, IoT technology isn’t much different from the devices currently used on a daily basis. Lightbulbs, kitchen appliances, and even clothing can all become a part of the Internet of Things with the addition of a connected sensor.

Here are four IoT building blocks your C-Suite should be familiar with:

MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems): MEMS are low-powered, miniature sensor sets that collect data, communicate with servers, and perform actions prompted by users and machinery. They come in all shapes and sizes and contain a variety of sensors including gyroscopes, accelerometers, eCompasses, thermometers, pressure and humidity detectors, etc.

By opening their APIs to third-party developers, companies empower the entire development community to improve their products and push innovation further. Partnerships: The IoT is literally built on partnerships, starting with the alliance between hardware and the Internet, and extending into strategic partnerships between businesses. As more businesses begin investing in the Internet of Things, it will be increasingly important for companies to align their interests and priorities.

If your executives are familiar with these IoT factors, they’ll be equipped to better understand your Internet of Things proposal. Be sure to send them diagrams, infographics, and articles of real-world examples leading up to your pitch. And if you really want to impress your executives, build a quick prototype that demonstrates what MEMS and APIs are capable of.

Step 2: Demonstrate How IoT Is Transforming Industries

Although the Internet of Things is still in its early adopter phase, there are plenty of industries where it has made significant business impact.

Automotive

IoT technology is the biggest revelation for the automotive industry since the internal-combustion engine. If you’ve ever used Uber or Lyft, you know the significance of IoT to modern commuters. However, ridesharing is only the beginning — the automotive industry is set to undergo a foundational transition. As PWC’s Connected Car Study states, “Automakers that have always seen themselves as product suppliers will take on a new identity as providers of mobility services.” The report estimates that by 2021, annual sales of connected car technology will triple to reach $140 billion.

Health & Wellness

What began as a variety of glorified pedometers has exploded into an industry predicted to be worth $5.4 billion by 2019. As the value of the wearable health and fitness market increases, product innovation will also boom. Activity trackers and smartwatches are now capable of monitoring our step counts and vital signs, and companies like Google are creating breakthrough products, including a contact lens that detects the wearer’s blood glucose level–a crucial metric for diabetics. As more connected devices comply with medical regulations, the Internet of Things has the potential to transform the healthcare system by making accurate health-monitoring devices more accessible, affordable, and portable.

Home Automation

Connected home devices are gaining popularity, with two-thirds of consumers planning to purchase an in-home device in the next five years. Revenue in this market is expected to grow 28.2% per year, resulting in a value of $20.86 billion by 2020. Smart thermostats like Nest have ushered in a new wave of home technology by learning user habits and temperature preferences, even learning when a user is and isn’t at home. And thanks to Apple’s HomeKit and Google’s Brillo operating system, consumers will soon be able to control everything from their refrigerator to the garage door with nothing more than a smartphone or tablet.

Industrial

Players in manufacturing, mining, oil and gas, and utilities are also joining the IoT movement, with investments in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) market spanning industries representing 62% of gross domestic product (GDP) among G20 nations. These large investments are predicted to result in even greater gains, according to analyst David Floyer, who predicts that the cumulative net value of IIoT spending will reach $1.7 trillion by 2020.

Manufacturing

Efficiency is key to profitability for manufacturing facilities. Wasted time or material costs businesses millions of dollars a year. According to a recent Microsoft case study, KUKA Systems Group built a new factory for Jeep Wrangler bodies that utilizes over 60,000 IoT devices connected to a central data-management system. Once all the pieces were in place, the Wrangler factory increased capabilities to consecutively operate 24 hours a day for over eight years, resulting in the creation of a new car body every 77 seconds, or 830 car bodies a day.

Toys & Games

Children’s entertainment icons from Barbie to Disney are delivering connected toy experiences to take play to new levels of interactivity and profitability, with analysts expecting the smart toy sector to generate $2.8 billion in revenue this year. As this generation becomes immersed with connected devices, the IoT movement will continue to grow exponentially. Gen Z, which is comprised of children born in 1995 and beyond, already makes up 26% of the US population and has $44 billion in purchasing power. That economic impact is only going to strengthen as they enter the workforce, likely in positions requiring a high degree of technological aptitude.

As you can see, the idea of a connected world is becoming a reality, and several industries are already making huge strides in the IoT. Seize this opportunity to join the stampede of innovation before it passes you by.

Step 3: Highlight Potential Consequences of Missing Out

Some executives are wary of the IoT waters, but standing on the shore can be riskier than diving in. Patience is rarely rewarded in modern markets. Case in point:

Blockbuster Video

While industry disruptors like Redbox and Netflix began making their way into consumers’ DVD trays, Blockbuster doubled down on their brick-and-mortar business model and lost everything. In 2004, Blockbuster was a $5 billion company ($5.9 billion in revenue) with 60,000 employees and 9,000 stores worldwide. Now, it’s as non-existent as Betamax. By the time Blockbuster threw together a digital strategy, the market was already flooded with companies offering a wide array of content and original programming.

Kodak

A little over a decade ago, Kodak was the king of the recreational photography market. Their affordable film cameras were perfect for amateur photographers looking to document their holidays and vacations. Now, with the advent of social media and smartphones with a 10+ megapixel camera, there’s no longer a need for point-and-shoot cameras full of film that needs to be developed. Although their industrial printing revenue has kept them afloat, Kodak’s stock price continues to fade like a printed picture left in the sun.

BlackBerry

Not long ago, every power player from Wall Street to Silicon Valley carried a Blackberry in their pocket. Fast forward to 2015, and we find BlackBerry clinging to a miniscule .4% smartphone market share. BlackBerry may still be the most secure OS on the market, but that doesn’t resonate with consumers who prefer convenience to privacy. Apps, touchscreens, and efficiency are the keys to success in today’s smartphone industry, and BlackBerry took too long to see it.

In summation, if Blockbuster started their streaming service first, Kodak expanded its digital offerings, and BlackBerry kicked its keyboard to the curb, we would be praising their acumen. Instead, they’ve become cautionary tales to the consequences of resisting innovation.

Step 4: Build a Solid IoT Proposal

By now, it should be clear that the Internet of Things is a worthy investment. The only thing left to do is sell its value to your executive team.

To help nail your pitch, consider these tips to make your presentation run smoothly:

1) Create a Sound Strategy

Before you book time on a C-level’s calendar, be prepared to present an iron-clad business strategy that answers the following:

What is the value proposition?

Fully detail how IoT technology can enhance value across business units, including product, customer experience, and finance. For example, detail how IoT capabilities impact competitive positioning, what customer pain points it alleviates, and forecast financial impact based on gains in market share.

How long will the plan take to enact?

In business, time is money, and your executives need to know how long your proposal will take to execute. Although you’ll want to keep timelines as short as possible, do not underestimate the time it takes to successfully execute an IoT strategy.

What will it cost?

The only thing more precious than time for executives is money. When pitching your IoT strategy, highlight how inexpensive connected hardware currently is and will continue to become overtime. For example a 3-axis accelerometer that used to cost $3 in 2007 now costs around $0.50, with even smaller packaging and better performance than the former version.

How do we determine ROI?

Now that your timelines and budgets are set, bring the pitch home by establishing an attractive ROI. Similar to your time frames, don’t overpromise with your estimated ROI. See how other companies in your industry have succeeded in the IoT space and plan accordingly.

How will it impact the next five years?

From preparations to implementation, create a roadmap for how your IoT strategy will impact business over the next five years. Define clear variations in time commitments, cost requirements, and projected profits, ending with recommendations for the rest of the decade if everything goes according to plan.

2) Share Success Stories

Although the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, there are plenty of success stories to reference when meeting with the C-Suite. In addition to others mentioned in this report, sample these for your pitch:

ATM leader Diebold placed IoT technology in 5,000 of their machines, resulting in a “17% increase in remote issue resolution, a 15% reduction in equipment downtime, and average downtime responses shortened to less than 30 minutes.”

BSX Athletics uses IoT technology to provide elite athletes with their blood-lactate threshold level without the need for blood-based lab tests.

The world’s largest agricultural equipment manufacturer, AGCO, uses IoT technology to help dealers achieve 10–15% fuel savings for customers through equipment optimization while reducing idle times by 15%.

Global vending machine company Cantaloupe Systems connects over 100,000 of their machines to the Internet of Things for faster stocking and maintenance information.

It’s best to find a case study that is related to your industry, but the breadth of companies currently implementing an IoT strategy is worth noting.

3) Utilize an Expert IoT Partner for Support

Any C_O worth their bonus will respond to your proposal with several questions, comments, and potential concerns. The best way to prepare for this feedback is to consult with an IoT partner who knows:

What is involved in executing a successful IoT strategy

Best practices for implementation, including timeline

What work flows look like for short-term and long-term projects

Pricing for the parts and labor your plan will require

Trusted hardware, cloud, and data partners

Well-defined success metrics

Best practices in design, usability, and promotion

Finding a partner with a breadth of IoT knowledge and experience can be difficult, but leaning on third-party expertise will better validate the ideas you’re selling to the C-suite.

Step 5: Pitch

By now, you can explain the basics of IoT technology in your sleep. You know how connected devices have revolutionized businesses across industries. You’ve seen what happens to companies that are slow to adopt modern technology. You’ve tailored your proposal and timeline to align with business goals. The only thing left to do is pitch.

Getting an Uber ride with the Amazon dash button,"See this article for an improved version for the new AWS IoT Button

This weekend I got inspired by this great post and decided to order an Amazon Dash Button. I knew this little device could help me solve a pain point I’ve had since I moved to San Francisco 3 months ago.

Like many people, I use Uber daily for my work commute — looking at you Uber, I would love to see a monthly commuter plan! Every morning, I go through the same routine — unlock phone, open the app, select the same pickup location and the same destination over and over again. I know, first-world-problem right?

But I love optimization, so what if all that can be done with the push of a button?

The goal was simple; by pressing a button — conveniently located in my bathroom, I would just need to finish getting ready and get out of my apartment. The car would be right there waiting for me without ever having to touch my phone.

I had my first live test this morning, and it was awesome!

Here is how I did it, and how you can try it out too — however, if you prefer to go directly to the code, please visit geoffrey/uber-dash.

Setup the button with the Amazon App

First, you need to setup your dash button to communicate with your network using the Amazon App. Follow the steps that you can find under Amazon App — Your account — Dash devices —carefully exit the setup process before the last step that actually lets you choose your order from Amazon. :speak_no_evil:

Get your button’s Identity

Using and running the first python snippet provided in this article, you can find the MAC address of your button (e.g. a0:02:dc:b1:3d:b2).

Intercept your button’s communications

After getting the button’s MAC address, I decided to play a little bit more with the network using Nodejs and the pcap module. I’m not a network expert, so I spent some extra time playing with the packets. I inspected their structure in order to spot and extract the ones I was interested in.

Unfortunately, I was only able to find MAC addresses as an array of integers (e.g. [160, 2, 220, 177, 61, 178]). I didn’t really search further and converted that array into the usual 6 group of two hexadecimal digits separated by colons— please ping me if you know a better way to extract hexadecimal MAC addresses from the packets with this pcap module! Then I compared these against the target’s MAC address: the dash-button. Every time they match, I call the handler function.

I also had to throttle the packet detections as I was detecting a couple of them within just one press.

Calling Uber when the button wakes up

Once you are able to detect the button waking up on your network, you’re almost done. You can now do virtually anything you want, including ordering a Uber ride using their API.

I created a very simple Express app that allows you to OAuth with Uber in order to give the app permissions to request rides for you.

And voilà, now we just need to listen for the button and call uber.call whenever the button gets pressed.

Get your first dash-uber ride!

First, clone this repo and edit the ./source/config.js file to add your dash button MAC address, your Uber application credentials as well as the pickup and drop-off coordinates and the product id (UberX, UberBlack…) you want to order.

Install dependencies using npm install.

Run ./dash-button.js which will listen for the dash button and call Uber:

In order to get the product id you want to use when the button is pressed, you can visit http://localhost:3000/products — after you log in. It’ll respond with the list of products available at your pickup location. Copy/paste the id of the product you chose into your config file, and relaunch the program.

Human + Normality = Sanity?,"What takes your dignity away? It varies from individuals, but it’s usually those pitying stares and awkward silences, the advice given in attempt to be helpful but comes across as though the empathy is not quite there — and I’m sure you could add to the list. This is often why it can come to the point where it becomes difficult to realise or understand one’s worth or rights whilst suffering mental health problems. Mental health problems not only have physical constraints, but also psychological, which can be crippling to an individual’s sense of dignity. It is easy to feel labelled, lost and lose self-value, but remember,

“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope” (Qur’an 2:286)

It is easier said than done, but you can build your self-esteem back up, you can strengthen your mind and body bi’ithnillah because suffering does not mean there is no hope. Although it may feel like there is no hope, don’t forget that Allah is Ar-Rahman (The Most Compassionate), Al-Wadud (The Loving One), Al-Basit (The Reliever), you can get through this!

Having dignity helps us to remain sane but this can diminish from the effects of mental illness and the attitude of those around us. Generally, mental health is viewed in a negative light, with some cultures even making the sufferer feel responsible for ‘failing’ to be ‘perfectly normal’ thus becoming a social outcast. By normal, perhaps society means ‘to fit in and be the same’ but who wants that? Our individuality is what makes us stand out and it should be embraced, that’s including our mental health. There is no such thing as perfect, well not for humans anyway, but if there is one thing we can always be, it is better.

Human dignity contributes to our sense of self-worth and in having a useful and purposeful life — because if we feel that we are of no worth, what worth is there to life? To acknowledge as well as respect our own and others dignity may be hard to do, especially when we feel there is no reason to do so.

“Verily, We created man of the best stature (mould)” (Qur’an 95:4)

It has been stated that mankind has been created أَحْسَنِ تَقْوِیم (in the best of moulds) which serves as a reminder, that externally and internally we were created by Allah, in a beautiful fashion, and whatever has been bestowed upon us from Allah is not undignified. You are valuable, you were created by the Best Creator!

It can be easy to fall into despair and a downwards spiral of self-loathing, because you are suffering and you aren’t acting ‘normal’. Just like there are differing disorders suffered, whether it be depression, personality or eating disorders, the norm from culture to culture differs. Which is why it is important to constantly ask ourselves, what exactly is normal? Does normality automatically mean an individual is sane?

It’s difficult to remember how important we are when we are having a tough time, and sometimes remembering that we are being tested can be more difficult as we feel that we are failing, but we are not the test makers.

“Say: “Nothing shall ever happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us. He is our Maula (Lord, Helper and Protector).” And in Allah let the believers put their trust.” (Qur’an 9:51)

So don’t sell yourself short! You are not a failure, your suffering does not define you, and you are not alone. Suffering a mental illness does not make an individual worthless, it’s how we deal with the suffering that matters.

Spiritual, social, legal and cultural influences all can play a role in shaping our sanity, outlook and value. This is essential in finding inner peace and successful connections to our surrounding environment and people. Sadly, dignity is one of those things that can be lacking in mental health care and treatment, through the use of stereotypes, discrimination from work, stigmatising language and behaviour, even by doctors and nurses! Therefore, interactions with others can be and feel difficult, which is why many mental health sufferers may feel like outsiders, affecting one’s dignity. Just because you may not behave or think like others does not mean you don’t have societal value.

Society creates labels for a sense of order and belonging, so when an individual is diagnosed with a mental health disorder, the discrimination towards the individual or associated groups can be quick. It creates a situation of them vs. us, because people think of the label rather than the individual. The stigma faced by sufferers can be crushing, with individuals no longer feeling like themselves, but simply a collection of doctors’ opinions and old fashioned ideas held about mental illness. This helps create prejudice, and it’s time we didn’t use such derogative language to describe those with mental illness and had an open mind towards mental health. It’s better to tackle something unknown to become compassionate and understanding than to stay ignorant. Just imagine how you’d feel if you were in their position or if it was a loved one. This alternative approach can help to change our perspective and remind us to treat sufferers with respect, value and honour. The respect, value and honour they deserve.

We all deserve and have the right to be treated with dignity.",https://medium.com/inspirited-minds/human-normality-sanity-d0a5e61161ad,['Inspirited Minds'],2015-12-06 00:27:21.668000+00:00,"['Dignity', 'Mental Health', 'Islam']"
Hunting Orion,"Just before midnight I headed back to the park and sat waiting for Orion to appear. I set up in the parking lot where I had started my hike earlier in the day. Setting up the telescope mount to track the movement of the stars takes about 30 minutes to do. It requires precise alignment to the north pole and can be challenging to get right. I also set up a time-lapse with a second camera to give a different perspective of the process involved in capturing these deep space photos. The compiled time-lapse condenses a 5 hour period into 11 seconds and gives you a unique view of how our world turns.

Orion was now peeking out over the horizon in the east. My camera was ready to go and it was time to see what I could get. These deep space images require immense patience as the light gets absorbed into the camera. Ideally you can do exposures as long as 10 minutes per frame, but with the equipment I had, you’d be lucky to get a 3 minute image without seeing blur. After a few failed test shots, I thought luck wasn’t going to be on my side. Then after a few camera setting adjustments I was able to get solid 3 minute frames. Happy with this, I set up my timer to take photos for the next couple of hours.

While hours passed and my camera snapped away, I wandered around the area exploring what the night had to offer. I didn’t venture all that far from the car because I’d hear scurrying about, crashes or loud noises nearby and then retreat to safety. It was most likely a racoon, but I wasn’t going to take any chances. Being out there completely alone definitely put me outside my comfort zone. I had to take a few deep breathes and look up to calm my nerves.

It was approaching 5am and I had been capturing the night sky for over 5 hours. The images that appeared on my camera looked good, but only when I got home and reviewed them on my computer would I know if I was going to get a decent final result. As I packed up my gear I noticed a thin layer of frost forming on everything. It was getting cold. I headed back to my campsite to get an hour or two of sleep before the sun began to rise.

Before I went to sleep, I looked at the captured frames again. There in front of my eyes was a structure of gas, dust and stars that was over 20 light years across. I looked up into the sky and saw the three stars that made up Orion’s belt and shook my head. It was hard to believe that what I was looking at on my camera was actually up there. For millennia these objects laid hidden until the early 1600s when we first laid eyes upon them with our newly minted telescopes. Knowing that fact, it’s quite an awesome feeling to see them appear on your normal everyday camera.

After returning home, I poured over the captured frames compiling them into one final image. I then spent hours tweaking them using software. Deep space images require huge amounts of post processing to make the details shine. Below are the results of the hunt. Not only was I able to capture the Orion Nebula, but the neighbouring Running Man Nebula as well. Half way through the night I moved my camera ever so slightly and as an added bonus caught the Horsehead and Flame Nebulae as well.",https://medium.com/get-outside/hunting-orion-306879dfca25,['Matt Quinn'],2015-02-24 18:05:01.964000+00:00,"['Story', 'Astronomy', 'Photography']"
Is Garry Trudeau Right About Charlie Hebdo?,"Is Garry Trudeau Right About Charlie Hebdo?

Garry Trudeau’s recent Polk award speech on the Charlie Hebdo attacks was both criticized and praised for his views on where to draw “red lines” with satire. Some saw his remarks as victim-blaming while others agreed the Hebdo cartoonists were racist, punching down instead of up.

He appeared on Meet The Press Sunday to discuss it further. His remarks in part:

I was as outraged as the rest of the word at the time. I mourn them deeply. We’re a very small fraternity of political cartoonists around the globe… What I didn’t do is necessarily agree with the decisions they made that brought a world of pain to France. I think that in France the wider Muslim community feels disempowered and disenfranchised in way that I’m sure is also true in this country. And that while I would imagine only a tiny fraction were sympathetic to the acts that were carried out and the killings, I think probably the vast majority shared in the outraged. Certainly that seems to be what people are hearing in the schoolyards in France now, is that they’re finding common cause at least with the issue, if not with the action. I think that’s bad for France, it’s unfortunate, it’s a tragedy that could have been avoided. But every body has to decide where the red lines are for themselves.

The #Giving Tuesday Fundraising Campaign,"#GivingTuesday’s 4thannual campaign this December 1, 2015, was created by 92 Y and the United Nations Foundation in 2012. Online donations have increased substantially from year to year. Last year’s donations were estimated at $45.7 million.

The campaign is a way for nonprofits to join over 30,000 participating organizations, foundations and corporations in catapulting charitable fundraising and charitable awareness. Through the online exposure of Giving Tuesday, nonprofits can draw attention to their own mission and campaigns while raising money.

Nonprofits have done everything from flash dances, water dunks[i], bake-a-thons, and family and friend donation challenges as part of their outreach. So what are some of the best strategies for #GivingTuesday?

Web-driven Messaging Giving Tuesday is social media driven, and an increasing number of people donate online. Tailoring your message to this audience is crucial. Hashtagging alone will not bring in donations, therefore messaging needs to be about concrete actions and ways to drive people to support your cause.

Planning ahead[ii] and developing messages that work in different mediums is key. Think about what you want to say via video, social media, email, text and your website. A coordinated campaign across these media will increase traffic to your donation page, so make sure that page is attractive, branded and clear.

In addition to message development for multiple distribution channels and planning, here are other ways to ensure success:

Get organized early: develop a time-line, schedule your content and determine who will implement your campaign.

Run a complementary campaign or a year-end campaign[iii] alongside Giving Tuesday, e.g. mention winter meals or sweaters needed in January or your current campaign goal of raising money to send a child to school.

Use relevant hashtags and/or creative hashtags to connect to your organization and campaign.

Video: kickoff the Giving Tuesday campaign, summarize your mission or thank donors by using your videos as part of your content to share online.

Make your website and donation pages scalable and accessible on mobile and tablets.

Donation Page: create a new donation page, or update your page for Giving Tuesday — keep the style consistent with your image and use your logo. Make it easy to navigate and reiterate your campaign cause and goals, and explain with visuals how the donors’ gift helps. Care’s donation page is attractive with its bright colors and images and allows donors to easily enter an amount they would like to contribute.

Social Media Success The #GivingTuesday campaign hashtag connects your organization to the global movement, meaning great exposure. Since many organizations participate, joining in local campaigns or running your own creative campaign hashtag in conjunction will target your message further and help your nonprofit stand out. Connect your nonprofit to the state and city level movements like #ILgive or #DCgivesmore. Last year the number of tweets with #GivingTuesday was 754,600.

Another popular component of the campaign is the #unselfie hashtag, which was a clever play off the popularity of the “#selfie” social media trend, and appealed to millennial and other social media savvy donors. Last year on Instagram, there were 7,500 #unselfie and #GivingTuesday posts. The Michael J. Fox Foundation found success by sharing their donors’ #unselfie photos on Instagram and other social media. They raised $348,201 and had a donor give a $100,000 match last year. Here are some images from #unselfie.

Tangible Goals & Multiple Gift Options Setting tangible goals[iv] is a great contribution motivator — donors like knowing exactly how their gifts are used, and can share the experience with others. Make your goal[v] and share progress over the course of the campaign.

World Bicycle Relief’s 2014 goal was to sponsor 500 bikes for African students. They surpassed their goal, raising enough funds for 754 bikes. Another great tangible goal setter is Heifer International. They use interactive donation pages with colorful visuals and graphics, and show potential donors gift options. For example, you can choose to put your money towards a chicken or a rabbit, and learn more about how each will help.

Donors may want to contribute, but may not be able or may not want to give monetary gifts. Having other gift options[vi] available will still help your cause and involve donors by making them more likely to contribute to your nonprofit’s causes in the future. For example, Phoenix house encouraged donors to share their time and write a letter to those in recovery. If your organization offers objects and supplies to those in need like food, clothing, bikes, etc., consider having a drive or asking donors to give a particular item, or to volunteer their time.

Video Incorporate video as a means to launch your Giving Tuesday campaign, support your mission and thank donors. Have a story to tell and try narrating from a different perspective, like the donors or stakeholders themselves. Use video to establish a greater emotional connection by showing the people involved in your cause.

Boston Hospital used one of their beneficiaries to help announce their Giving Tuesday campaign.

Rotary International used giving Tuesday as a time to thank donors and showcase how their contributions have helped reach the organization’s goals, instead of just focusing on content that asked for donations.

Donor Appreciation Thanking donors[vii] and recognizing their contributions, like Habitat for Humanity’s 2014 campaign did with their website, makes donors feel appreciated and more involved in your nonprofit’s fundraising cause. Habitat used a side bar that showed their top donors and team contributions.

Video can be an excellent medium through which to thank donors. Partners Relief and Development created a great compilation video to show their appreciation.

What to Avoid in Your Next Campaign

Not using mobile[viii]: mobile donations are increasing, so make use of this growing donor preference. Check out how Africare uses Text2Give to accept donations via texting that charges phone providers.

Lack of visibility[ix]: avoid text, colors and format that are difficult to read and low in contrast. Make fonts and forms large and clear, and use colors for variation and interest.

Making it just too hard[x]: user profiles and logins, multiple forms or long forms and questionnaires make donating painful. Keep donation forms simple, avoid logins and don’t require too much personal information upfront — that’s what follow-up questionnaires do to learn more about your donors.

Bombarding your donors: Giving Tuesday is a large social media campaign and it is likely other organizations will be participating and contacting your same donors — don’t overdo your campaign outreach. Instead limit the amount of messages you send out, and make them succinct. Also, don’t just ask for money. Vary your content or consider asking for non-monetary contributions.

Asking for contributions only on Giving Tuesday[xi]: use Giving Tuesday as part of a larger end of the year, or year round giving campaign that can continue past Dec. 1st. Participate in other giving days like #GiveLocal[xii]. Use Giving Tuesday to gain momentum for your goals, not as your only fundraising campaign.

Not thanking donors: it is a big deal for someone to choose to donate to an organization; they want to feel like they have helped a good cause and that their help was appreciated. Thank donors via your website, personal letters and emails, or through social media or videos. This helps increase donor retention for future causes, too.

Disregarding corporate partnerships: some of the largest amounts of funds raised were because of donation and gift matching from corporations[xiii] and foundations. Look for partnerships and promote these partnerships in your campaign to encourage others to help you reach joint goals while tapping into a new network as well. Cross-promoting online will help both parties involved.

As part of A Story Each Day

I try very hard not to be one of those crazy people on the subway — one of the ones that holds an entire conversation with them self, and misses their stop doing so.

Waiting to get off the subway, I turned to face the closing door. I locked my gaze forward, looking out the subway car into the station at all of the people funneling up stairs like a reverse waterfall. The train moved past the station, and darted into the dark tunnels that snake through the underbelly of New York City. My reflection appeared: Dark, shadowed, a dimly lit mirror that hadn’t been cleaned in far too long. I stared at my reflection, trying to recognize myself. I was so focused and so intent that I didn’t notice the young kid who was standing almost right next to me, studying my reflection almost as closely as I was. It wasn’t until he spoke up that he shattered my focus.

“What are you doing here?” He asked, as if I had no right to be riding the subway at all. I looked over — not quite sure if he was even talking to me.

“I’m… going home…”

Who is this kid?

“You live here?” his voice took on a friendlier tone. More curious, and less accusing, but still sharp and precise.

“Yeah. In Brooklyn.”

He looked at me with some skepticism, but I could tell he wanted to question further.

“Where do you live?” I asked.

“Virginia.” He claimed, proudly.

“Really?” I turned to him, or at least my reflection did. “I grew up there. What part are you from?”

“I thought so.” He said, almost letting a smile through his expression. He didn’t seem like the kind of person who was comfortable talking to a stranger — he seemed like he would be more comfortable talking to himself, and yet, his curiosity fueled our discussion and kept it going.

“What are you doing in New York City?” I asked.

“What are you doing in New York?” He countered.

“I…” I had to think about that, but I had a damn good answer: “I live here.”

“Why do you live here?”

“Because…I do. You still didn’t answered my question.”

“Which one?” He quizzed.

“Which one what?”

“Which question: The part of Virginia that I’m from, or what I’m doing in New York?”

Just then, I realized that the train had stopped, passengers had gotten off, funneled up the stairs like a reverse waterfall once again, and the doors were closing. They clamped shut in front of me before I could realize what I’d missed, and the train kept on moving.

“Damn. I- You made me miss my stop! And no, beside distracting me from my station, what are you doing in New York?”

“I’m looking for someone.”

“Who are you looking for?”

“Well. I thought I would recognize him. I’m not sure if I do, though. I definitely didn’t recognize him when I first saw him.”

The train slowed to a halt, as I cycled through his words again-

Wait –

“This is your stop, isn’t it?” He said.

“Stand clear of the closing doors, please.”

I stepped off the train, onto the platform, my mind racing.

Wait–

The doors slid shut.

Time Unfolds,"I am a daydeamer. Or simply a dreamer, you may say. And most of the time, an optimist. Or more likely a sloppy one with so many dreams, and fantasies, and things I wanted to achieve.

I wanted to have a clothing brand, I wanted to make schools, I wanted to develop more games, I wanted to open a Coffee Shop, I wanted to help elevate the state of our nation’s economy by providing a proper education to Small Businesses about the use of technology and how to utilise social media, I wanted to support our country’s educational system continuously by lending my hands for the teachers and lecturers, and introduce them to future technologies.

I even wanted to create a Peci/Kopiah that would be able to automatically tweet every time I pray with it, so that I could trigger others to do the prayers as well.

Months before my wedding day, one of my close friend told me, “I actually miss the time where I were exactly like you, you know. Now all I want is anything but simple. I want to meet a woman of my life, get married, have kids, and create a happy family.”

At that time, what he said didn’t make any sense to me. At all.

Days passed and right before I was about to get married, a friend whom also a person I look up to, told me that: “I really wish that after marriage, you’ll still be the person you are now. The Daus Gonia that we all knew.”

Again, I wasn’t really grasp his meaning back then.

…And here it goes now. I am now a happily married guy, a father of a very cute little 1 year old son. And finally I have realised what were they saying back then.

Maybe if someone ask me right at this moment ‘what do you really want?’, I would simply give the same answer with what my friend said to me that day. I want no other than happiness upon my family, my wife, my son, and my friends. That is my top priority that no one else will take away from me.

But hey, I am so blessed I got the best family, and the very best wife that allows me to be whatever I want to be, creating whatever I want to create. How lucky I am, right?

So even my priority changes over time and maybe not like how it used to be, I really wish that I will forever still be able to create. Still be able to imagine.

So yeah, let’s never stop imagining. Let’s never stop dreaming and trying to make it happen. :)",https://medium.com/happiness-artisans/time-unfolds-310191a943cd,['Daus Gonia'],2015-12-08 03:52:29.406000+00:00,"['Relationships', 'Life']"
More Than $1K Worth of Clothes I’ll Never Wear Again,"by Emily Gould

I’ve tried to write the first sentence of this post about a hundred times now and it’s proving very difficult; it turns out money matters are incredibly hard to talk about. I think we found a taboo, you guys! Imagine: even here, in this adult-diapered medium, there’s a last bastion of self-revelation that’s untouched. I’m just stalling now basically. Okay, (deep breath) here goes.

In 2008 I got a book advance of $200,000, of which my agent took 15% and the IRS took approximately one-fourth. Still, that’s a lot of money, even paid out in quarters over the course of several years, and for a few months after I got that initial check — for the first time in my adult life — I mistakenly assumed that I didn’t have to keep track of how much money I was spending. Because surely this good fortune was the beginning of more good fortune to come!

There would be foreign rights sales, audio rights sales, fat old-school magazine payments for first serial rights when the book came out, maybe a film or TV option — not to mention all the paid teaching and speaking opportunities that having written the kind of book that a publisher would pay a six-figure advance for would undoubtedly bring my way. And then, too, there would be another payment of the same amount or more money for another book, a book I couldn’t quite imagine and hadn’t even started writing, but would definitely be able to write in a year or less after the first book came out because what was I, lazy? No, I was quick, quick like a blogger!

Without whining or belaboring, I will just say briefly that precisely zero of these rosy fantasies came to fruition. Other stuff happened, maybe better stuff in the long run, who knows. My publisher, I’m sure, did the best it could. My book did the best it could. The U.S. economy did the best it could, or something. Please don’t imagine a pathetic little violin solo here. I’m not asking for sympathy, I know I’ve been lucky. I’m just saying, if you ever find yourself in a similar position — and indeed, a few of you undoubtedly will! — here are some simple rules to follow, all of which I broke.

1. Don’t live alone in New York City unless you have a full-time, high-paying job and plans to keep it for the forseeable future!

2. Don’t pay for your own health insurance!

3. No international travel, even if your boyfriend is living abroad for a year!

4. No therapy!

5. Don’t do yoga teacher training, it is so expensive and you will never make any money as a yoga teacher!

But wait, actually, you know what? I’m glad I violated all of those rules. My year of working on my book pretty much exclusively while sometimes flying back and forth to Moscow and going to therapy all while renting my own apartment where I could have the furniture and stuff arranged any way I liked and if there were messes they were all mine — that experience was priceless. Well, it wasn’t priceless — I know exactly how much it cost (see above). And it sucks to have spent all that money and to be broker than a joker now. But if I had it to do over, I wouldn’t do anything differently… except for one thing.

I WOULD NOT BUY ANY CLOTHES. NOT ANY. ZERO CLOTHES.

Owning my mistakes and ne regretteing rien is kind of my “thing,” but these garments are the exception. Some of these items were mistakes from the moment I walked up to the register. Others just wore out their welcome, or have context associated with them I can’t stomach now.

Also, I should state upfront, I have worn a thrifted button-down shirt or, in the summertime, an American Apparel t-shirt and the same pair of jeans or cutoff jean-shorts almost every single day for the past six years, so what I thought I was doing buying any of this gear is very mysterious. Like for example:

Who doesn’t need a leather vest? Oh wait, I know: everyone. Everyone doesn’t need a leather vest. This is from that teenager store “LF” and it cost, oh god. I think it cost $200. I wasn’t hankering after a leather vest for weeks or anything either, I just saw it, tried it on, it looked good over whatever I was wearing that day or the mirror was really flattering or something, and I bought it. Almost immediately afterwards I realized that zero of my outfits were improved by a leather vest and also this particular vest was, maybe because I bought it at a teenager store, an appropriate size for a teenager. A small teenager. With a small ribcage. I want to keep my financial dysmorphia as separate as possible from my body dysmorphia but I will just say that it wasn’t until I saw a photo of myself wearing it — a photo taken by someone I don’t know during a panel I moderated at the Brooklyn Book Festival, which perhaps that selfsame helpful anonymous Internet person has submitted for use alongside my Wikipedia entry‚ that I realized: wearing an undersized leather vest makes a person look HELL OF LARDY.

(I know that I am not fat, but some clothing is more flattering than other clothing, and if we can’t speak frankly about that then we should just call it a day right now.)

Related: this dress. I bought it in anticipation of a holiday party, towards the end of my year of plausible potential-nonbrokeness, and I guess I wanted to send a message with it along the lines of: I can afford a nice dress. Unfortunately the high waist of this dress bisects the broadest part of my giant ribcage and blouses out right below it. A person with small shoulders and a tiny natural waist, aka the inverse of my body type, would look great in this dress. “Are you sure you should be drinking that?” said someone at the holiday party, pointing to the glass of wine in my hand. It took me a minute to realize that what she was implying wasn’t that I was drunk, but that I was pregnant.

I was not pregnant. I never wore this dress again. It cost probably around $300.

Wool cheerleader skirt from Opening Ceremony, more than $100. Because a wool cheerleader skirt is a totally appropriate thing for an adult to own. “Simple Basics for Winter: A Wool Cheerleader Skirt,” Lucky magazine does not ever say. I blame this one on going shopping with rich enablers, lovely but irresponsible people who also encouraged me, during the same shopping trip, to purchase a 3.1 Philip Lim cashmere sweater-blouse that was adorable and genuinely luxurious and which I left hanging in an inadequately defended closet, the result being that it was consumed almost 100% by moths. The moths refused to eat this skirt. We can only assume that they held it in contempt.

It’s also too small for me, but that seems besides the point.

This ethereal little number was purchased for the purpose of wearing to a good friend’s wedding, a wedding I had some trepidation about attending because my ex-boyfriend is even better friends with this good friend than I am and I was 100% sure that he would be there. He was not there. Also it was unexpectedly cold and rainy in spite of being a summertime outdoor wedding so I wore a jacket over this filmy sex-dress the whole time anyway.

Just looking at this dress now reminds me of how stupid I was to go shopping in anticipation of seeing someone I never wanted to see again. Also in retrospect it’s so obvious that this is not my style. Flowy, filmy, witchy sleeves are a perfect physical representation of the kind of girl I used to think I was, that mysterious, ringing-like-a-bell-through-the-night type. Wouldn’t you love to love her?

In a way it’s a relief to know myself better now and to know that I’m not a filmy wispy person. However, this dress cost $250 and I will never wear it again.

I wore this objectively awesome floral Betsey Johnson dress, a reissue of a classic Betsey style, to a lot of my book release events and readings and such. I bought it because it matches my book jacket. I also wore it in this cute photo. During all of those events I was nervous and I sweated a lot and now the dress, which is white, has yellow marks in the underarms that have thus far resisted all attempts at laundering (paging A Clean Person, kind of, but I’m pretty sure it’s hopeless).

Want to buy this dress? I’m pretty sure it’s historic. I am going to say it originally cost $250 but, shudder, I think that’s actually a low-end estimate.

Why can’t I wear it again, you ask? Uh, why can’t you wear your wedding dress again, jerk?! (Also the sweatstains.)

Oh and it made total sense to also buy the shirt version of this garment. Sure! Why not.

Some other sundry purchases, not pictured here because I’ve already found a way to destroy or misplace them, include a pair of jeans bought at my anxious thinnest that for a hot minute I tried to alter by slitting the waistband in the back and a pair of No. 9 clogs that I had custom-made in red patent leather in a fit of amnesia about my inability to wear high-heeled shoes of any nature (I gave them away at a clothing swap). And there’s probably other stuff that, mercifully, I’m blocking.

I’m telling you about this in the hope that someone out there might be able to learn from my mistakes. Or, if you’re a size 6 or thereabouts, you also have the option of wearing them. Make me an offer!

Emily Gould would just like to point out that $200K is not very much money at all when you think about, for example, what some publisher paid for sTORItelling.

A Year Ago Today I Got a Rejection Letter from Medium,"Improper use of “whom” instead of “who.”

A year ago, I was looking to be a part of something big, so naturally I thought of Medium. Ev’s story and the values of Obvious Corp, resonated with me, so I applied. I really wanted it but I didn’t get it, so I did the next best thing and met Ev yesterday, a whole year later. I was never formally trained in design, never worked for a large company and my longest running job was working as a technology teacher at a democratic school. Truthfully, I never graduated college either. Though I completed all my coursework, the college failed my basic English proficiency exam, for reasons I’ll never know nor do I want to know now.

While all that is not the accepted criteria for a designer, it wasn’t until I met Mikko-Pekka Hanski — a former teacher and one of Finland’s most influential designers—that I realized the strengths of being an outsider, namely perspective. I was pretty determined to move my design career forward, so I did what any underemployed millenial would do.

I stopped waiting for doors to open, I hustled and made my own way.

I designed as many apps as I could, I learned more code and built throwaway projects like typelift, “a typographer’s sandbox.” I also worked for cheap, sometimes for free while applying to jobs. At the same time, I struggled to define myself as a creative — I’m a generalist, a tinkerer who’d been doing graphic design since high school yearbook. I think that summer is when I realized that hiring was broken in Silicon Valley, that it was as elitist as the old guard, where Facebook is the new IBM on your resume. Which is why I’m heartened when Jack Ma says;

“Don’t hire the most qualified, hire the craziest”

—

Fortunately Silicon Valley has plenty companies that hire for crazy, and soon after, I settled into a role as a product designer for Verdigris, working on machine learning & smart energy. It filled a lot of criteria that I was looking for — a world changing problem, staff diversity and an appreciation of design thinking. I’ve learned more working with this startup in 1 year then I have in the last 5 years of my career. I also got to execute on everything from branding to agile product management. If you want to move far in your career, work for a Seed or Series A stage company.

But funny thing, I couldn’t shake rejection. I was simply unwilling to accept that big companies like Medium, Twitter, VSCO, Nextdoor, Heroku…found my skills lacking for even an interview. I’m not saying that the candidates who were hired weren’t qualified … but I am saying that when I applied to jobs using my first name, Dominic, I got a lot more responses. So let me go on the record and say:

My name is Dominic Vikram Babu,

I’m not a vegetarian nor am I a developer.

I’m a beef eating, product designer, musician & publisher.

True story, most folks find it hard to believe that a South Asian can be anything other than a doctor, engineer or computer scientist, let alone a creative. But so jarring was this experience around Western perspectives of people of color with uncommon names, that I had to do something. Letter of rejection from Medium aside, the social reawakening in America around #BlackLivesMatter, along with a request from a friend to publish his writings, led me to turn a little tape blog into a radical publication.

MLK Jr. 5'x6' Watercolor @yungrama

I remember thinking that starting a publication around social justice, diversity of ideas and critical of technology in Silicon Valley, could be bad for business — but I didn’t really care and had little to lose. I still think the best thing I’ve written was “A Letter to Peter Thiel about Diversity,” where I pen a letter pretending to be a South Asian tech fanboy who is confused about Thiel’s views within “The Diversity Myth.” It played out my cognitive dissonance between my love for Thiel but my feelings of rejection as a person of color — so much so that I painted a watercolor portrait of my anti-idol.",https://medium.com/endless/a-year-ago-today-35229da886df,[],2015-07-29 18:40:39.450000+00:00,"['Culture', 'Media', 'Millennials']"
Why you should read Blink,"Gut feeling explained

Blink is an amazing book by Malcolm Gladwell. Gladwell is what I would call a damn good storyteller. This guy brings scientific research about gut feelings and intuition in a manner that is super pleasant to read. You will read this book like a good novel. Once you start you won’t be able to stop. Do yourself a favor and go read it.

But what will you learn out of it? You will discover the value of intuition. You will see how you can make better decisions without overthinking.

Oh. My. Blog.,"Independent data

Once you’ve made this sort of mental reorientation, it’s much clearer that there is not a single constant presentation form of the source data. Your notes could be presented in a number of forms: a blog post, a presentation, a book, etc.

This all builds on the related concepts of representation independence and data abstraction. Think about changing the theme of a PowerPoint or Keynote presentation. Obviously, there is something underneath that is your real presentation, with the theming being endlessly changeable.

One of the most technically interesting startups I’ve had the opportunity to work at put a lot of effort and investment into building systems that structured some of the hairiest data around: the entire molecular interaction graph. The solution at that company was to use ontologies, to represent a substantial fraction of all human knowledge about the science of life. Tricky stuff, no doubt. If we could do something useful with notoriously difficult biological data, surely there’s some way to make forward progress with my little blogging problem.

Blogflows

Originally, when I started blogging on my own site, wrote all of my posts in reStructuredText and then used Pelican to process this source data into a static website view of that data. The true source, immutable data was tracked in version control, Mercurial specifically. Even there it was possible to create more derived views, so I created an exported form of one of my Mercurial repos as a Git repo, hosted on GitHub, instead of BitBucket. This allowed me to go back to any point in time on any element of my work and create new derived forms of that data, as I wished. This mental model of my blog posts, as data commits to a Mercurial repo, was very easy to internalize and allowed me to flesh out the other elements of the whole “blogging about code” project. Version control systems are some of my favorite applications as a developer, and Mercurial is one of my favorites.

The reason I stopped using this workflow was the composition interface. I ended up writing my posts in reST using PyCharm, which was great for maintaining a sort of representational independence but awful for helping me visualize the post as it evolved. Yes, I could just rebuild my site on my local machine and see my changes, but it ended up ultimately feeling like sculpting via remote-control robot.

So I switched to writing here on Medium, almost entirely for the composition experience. I can hear all of my vi and emacs using friends groaning that I couldn’t handle a little bit of interface difficulty in my editor. But I think this is a more serious issue than people give it credit to be. My concern basically comes down to how the tool affects my transcription fluency. If you’ve not come across this idea before, the research (as I understand it) points to the speed and ease with which a person can transcribe their thoughts having a huge impact on how well they can learn and grow. Here’s a great summary of the research, on Medium.

[Insert solution here]

What I wish this blog post was is an announcement of my new open source webapp that solves this problem. It’s not. I couldn’t dream of writing a document composition interface as beautiful and useful as Medium’s. So, instead, I’m going to describe my wishlist of tools. My hope is that I can get some feedback on how 80% of what I want can already be done. If I can get that far, then I may be so bold as to take a crack at the remaining 20%.

Composition

This is the killer part. Medium’s editor is incredibly useful. There’s nothing even close, so far as I can tell. Ghost blogs approach the beauty of the output, but the composition is back to being done in Markdown. But maybe there is some awesome open source blog post editor out there. Who knows? If you do, seriously, tell me on Twitter.

An interesting workaround might be to simply continue to use Medium as my editor and then scrape the derived pages. Then, the HTML could simply be translated to some representation independent format (like Markdown or reST), afterwards. This sounds hacky, but perhaps doable.

Using Medium as my primary composition interface would be way less troubling if Medium, like Twitter before it, had an API. If there was an API, then I (or any other interested developer) could just suck back out the necessary post data for use in other contexts. Am I unreasonably optimistic to wish that this will some day be the case? Perhaps, but I hope not.

Publishing

Once I have my data (blog posts) in a representation independent format, I want to be able to publish derived versions (pretty web pages) in multiple formats. This is pretty easy on my personal domain, toromon.com. I have been using Pelican there, but it would be relatively trivial to switch to some other static site generator. Personally, I find Pelican to be a solid platform that’s very easy to use and extend, so I’m not inclined to switch anytime soon. But I absolutely want to maintain the ability to do so.

Orchestration, etc.

Once I’ve gotten the above working as I’d like for my final workflow to go something like this:

Write the post. Translate to a representation independent format. Commit that data to source control and push to remote mirrors. Produce the derived views: my personal blog, Medium, etc.

The glue code to connect all of this seems well within my reach, so I hope to be able to pull all of this together and then publish my solution, similar to my previous blog workflow.

Help me

In case it wasn’t abundantly clear, I need and want your help on this one. I’m going to be trialling a few approaches, and I would love some suggestions on better approaches. Have an idea? Please let me know on Twitter.",https://medium.com/data-engineering/oh-my-blog-42e5e059d240,['Jeff Smith'],2015-06-06 01:26:32.901000+00:00,"['Mercurial is one of my favorites', 'Data', 'Functional Programming', 'Blogging']"
Experiencing Transness: What the f*ck is non-binary?,"(TW: transphobia, swearing, cissexism)

I could write this article by giving a bland definition, throwing in a few photos, and calling it a day, but I’m not. There needs to be more explanation behind the phrase “I’m non-binary.”

How do we experience gender? I challenge anyone reading this article to ponder: “What makes me, my gender?” And to some, that might be a threatening concept, that the idea of questioning your gender is suddenly a taboo topic. Upon considering one’s gender, we can realize the majority if not entirety of one’s gender can be rooted in harmful generalities and stereotypes. Also keeping in mind modern conventions of beauty that are inherently two things: Very white and very rooted in patriarchal standards of “beauty”. And if you don’t fit these requirements, you’re told that you’re inferior until you meet these requirements. Challenging these oppressive structures can be liberating. But not everyone has the access to the safety net I do. I have the privilege of being a white, able bodied, non-intersex, college-educated, DFAB (designated female at birth) trans person in California. Because of these privileges I don’t experience many of the oppressive behaviors that occur to my trans siblings across the globe. Just this year alone, over 20 transwomen/transfeminine people have been murdered. I’m a very femme presenting person and when you look at me you don’t immediately register something as being “different” from the gender binary. Which in of itself, is a fucked up thing to think about someone at first glance. Gender in our society is centuries of binary thinking that is immediately threatened at the first hint of anything as the “other.” We’ve seen this time and time again in our readings, especially when discussing gender in the Lauretis article, The Technology of Gender, when she states that the “representation of gender is a construct.” She is alluding to the fact that how we experience gender is a constructed concept. Gender is a construction based on binaries and biology. These binaries restrict and oppress people based on their genitalia, essentially. The metaphorical ivory tower can be blamed for this train of thought, primarily based on Freud. Between penis envy and castration anxiety, people are reduced to their genitalia and all of this discussion revolves around the “male body” (which is also a really fucked up phrase since not all males have penises and some females do have penises, go figure.). The leader of psychoanalytic thought legitimately believed that all people with vaginas secretly wanted a penis and all people who have penises are afraid of a vagina metaphorically castrating them. That is something that is legitimately influencing our theory today. Sounds ridiculous doesn’t it?

Of course, you might be asking, “But Alix, What about intersex people? What about non-binary people?” I’m glad you asked, this is all part of a binary system that influences every aspect of our lives, male/female, gay/straight, black/white, right/wrong, true/false. All of these are binaries and anyone who doesn’t fit into these binaries are inherently “wrong” or made out to be the “other” and this other is cast our socially and ridiculed or oppressed to the point of brutal murders or driving people to suicide. Trans people do not fit into these binaries or these standards of binaries (“passing” as your true gender is one of those oppressive requirements, more on this later.) Which drives many trans people to hide their trans status and live their lives in stealth*.

I had the privilege of moderating a discussion for my student group called Asterisk, we are a transgender identified and allies group on campus and we try to orchestrate discussions about gender and work as advocates and activists on our campus for trans rights. In our last discussion, we talked about how we experienced gender and how we fall into gender stereotypes in an attempt to “pass”* as our desired gender. Of course, this isn’t always how things work. As a gender non-conforming person, there isn’t really a rule book of how to “pass” as my gender because it’s consistently been erased. On top of that, the ideal for the androgynous non-binary “look” is inherently a DFAB person, dressed in a masculine nature, white, and thin. Society rejects anything else as false and not true androgyny. Ruby Rose and Kristen Stewart are examples of these standards that people who identify as androgynous are held too. Now imagine what that must be like for a person of color, a disabled person, a DMAB person, a fat person. These standards of non-binary beauty is harmful and drive us to extremes in the name of “fitting the mold.”

Ruby Rose

Kristen Stewart

And if someone doesn’t fit this very specific mold, how on earth could they possibly be anything but cisgender*? I’m here to tell you that what you’ve thought about gender is dead wrong.

I exist outside of the binary. I don’t belong to one or the other, my identity doesn’t allow it. I am constantly questioning the world around me and how the world interacts with my gender just as my gender interacts with the world. It is a confusing concept but it’s helped me develop this sense of identity that I would have never found within a binary. I’m not a boy, but I’m not a girl either. I am simply a person.",https://medium.com/gender-theory/experiencing-transness-what-the-f-ck-is-non-binary-b5f17cd4391f,['A.

How an Ordinary Person Can Memorise the Qur’an in 6 Months,"Assalamu ‘Alaykum, I’m Qari Mubashir

This is a story about what happens when you recognise that there’s more in this world for you to become. That you don’t have to have certain things to make contributions to the world.

Lessons learnt at every stage of Hifz including (a) the start (b) the memorising phase (c) revision (d) teachers (e) the difficult moments and (f) productivity.

What’s most important to your journey, whether you memorise in 6 months or more

What others are saying

“It is filled with a lot of good tips and observations that will surely benefit many!” “I am very happy that you have created such a very important book.” “..the book was amazing.. reading it felt as though you had written some of my own experiences for me.. especially regarding the many different teachers and their manners of teaching and so on.. it took me many years to finish just 13 ajzaa.. yet last year alone I completed the remainder 17” “Qari has inspired me on so many levels and moved me to act” “I must say, Masha’Allah, it is beautifully written. Inspiring all others like me who are desperate for motivation.” “I don’t know where I would be without Qari at the moment.”

Does Social Opinion really matter?,"When I told my mom that I want to marry a girl outside my caste, I could see crinkles growing fast on her head, like a stream of water flowing in to fill the gaps. I asked her, why are you so worried? She replied, “Char log kya kahenge?” (What will people say about it?).

It’s beyond my logical thinking that I take such life-changing decisions based on what people think about it. Contrary to that, almost everyday I count on the opinions of my friends, and even random people at times, before I take decisions. Decisions like, which phone to buy? which movie to watch? where to travel? which book to read? Marijuana: good or bad?..(OK, may be not this one!) and so on.. are majorly driven by people’s opinion. It is actually the reason why reviews and ratings are the heart of so many tech companies ( IMDB, Tripadvisor etc).

The thought has been stuck in my mind for a while — Does social opinion really matter?. Being in my late 20’s, it’s about my age that I should take a stand on such “philosophies” of life. Rewinding back, I recall a whole bunch of my childhood memories revolving around “Char log kya kahenge?” which somehow faded as I aged. The wise man grew in me, who could take his own stand on bigger choices of life, yet running around asking for opinions on rather smaller things.

The mystery here lies in the line you draw between your personal space and social space. That boundary is already defined when your emotions overtake the mind. And when that happens, the opinion is rather a judgement of the society. However, when it comes to this consumeristic world, you seek for a “social validation” before you make a choice. It is rare to go against the masses, when choosing a product (or service). More I think about it, more I realise the importance of social opinion, and it’s quiet presence in my life.

Isn’t it in the power of social opinion to make or break governments, companies, religions, markets…? I wish to see a world where society itself can drive its future, a world where every individual is visible, counted and considered. In the era of smartphones and social media platforms like facebook, I see us heading in the right direction. It’s just a matter of time that our society will start listening it’s own voice!",https://medium.com/sociale-blog/does-social-opinion-really-matter-41aabf91a03f,['Akhilesh Lahoti'],2015-12-24 14:26:08.488000+00:00,"['Social Media', 'Philosophy Of Life', 'Opinion']"
Some Indiana SB 101 (RFRA) synopsis.,"There’s a lot of misunderstanding about this new law, because people are reading it as plain English when they shouldn’t.

Below I’m going to go through the three sections that people seem to be having the most problem understanding, Sections 8, 9 and 11.

“Sec. 8. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability. (b) A governmental entity may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion only if the governmental entity demonstrates that application of the burden to the person: (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; And (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.”

This only effects Government interactions with Religion. This has absolutely no bearing on Person to Person interactions within the law.

“Sec. 9. A person whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened, by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding. If the relevant governmental entity is not a party to the proceeding, the governmental entity has an unconditional right to intervene in order to respond to the person’s invocation of this chapter.”

My Interpretation of this: If the Government of Indiana is substantially burdening a Person’s free exercise of religion, they may invoke this chapter in a suit against the government. If a Person invokes this chapter against another person then the Government must interject to determine if the person can invoke this law.

“Sec. 11. This chapter is not intended to, and shall not be construed or interpreted to, create a claim or private cause of action against any private employer by any applicant, employee, or former employee.”

At lot of people are interpreting this section as meaning employee’s have no right at pursuing punishment against an employer for terminating them due to the employer’s religious beliefs. That’s not what that is saying, in regards to the rest of the bill. What its saying in regards to the rest of the bill is that Private Employers are not covered by this RFRA. It spells out pretty clearly that the RFRA is only to be used in terms of Government and its interactions with people/businesses.

The main issue at hand with all of this, as I see it, is that people are reading this as though its plain English. Its not. It’s legalese. Which is to say that it IS English, but its put down in such a way so that judges will interpret it the way it is intended to be interpreted.",https://medium.com/founder-s-keepers/some-indiana-sb-101-rfra-synopsis-5f248e2e4572,['Darren Hertenstein'],2015-03-30 14:39:23.523000+00:00,"['Indiana', 'RFRA']"
The Most Volatile Countries In The World — 2015 Edition,"That’s just touching the Middle East. There is still the problem of ISIS, the bloody civil war in Syria, the on-going collapse of Iraq, the challenge of the Kurds who want an independent Kurdistan. And this doesn’t take into account the needs of other Middle Eastern states like Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Oman.

(If you are confused, hopefully the graphic below will provide some clarity.)

And, that’s just one region of the world. What about Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America? Even North America, which has traditionally remained unaffected by changes around the world — specifically geopolitical changes— is facing challenges.

Read below for a briefing of the most volatile countries in the world.

Libya

The Economist (2015)

Since the ousting of Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has gone from having the highest quality of life in Africa to being called a failed-state. However, things can always get worse. In late 2014, ISIS expanded into Libya, capturing Derna, close to both Italy and Egypt. As ISIS enters Libya, rival factions continue fighting for control over the country, even as world powers and the UN call for the fighting to stop. Oil output has declined significantly, from a peak of 1.7 million to just 500,000 barrels a day. Meanwhile, the Economist has said that the Beida government has told the National Oil Corporation (state owned) to deposit income into an offshore account, not the Libyan treasury. With al-Shabab in East Africa and Boko Haram in the West, ISIS entering Africa could create even more regional and global insecurity. With heightened political and social instability, Libya faces an uncertain future.

Brazil

Protests against Petrobras scandal in Brazil (2015)

Things have taken a turn for the worst in Brazil, who is a member of BRICS. Economically, their economy has stalled. At Davos 2015, the Brazilian Finance Minister said economic growth “will be flat” this year. Meanwhile, unemployment rose to 5.9% in February and FT has reported that the Brazilian economy could shrink, recording its “worst performance since 1931”. Socially, things aren’t much better. A recent Petrobras scandal resulted in hundreds of thousands of protestors taking to the streets (270,000 in Sao Paulo alone), demanding the impeachment of President Rousseff. And, to top it all off, cities in Brazil are facing a massive drought. Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America. If it breaks down — economically, politically or socially — Brazil’s challenges could soon become regional.

United States

President Obama (2015)

The United States faces challenges that no other country in the world does. At the on-going IMF and World Bank meetings, one of the major themes is the changing US role in the world. The Chief Economic Advisor to the Indian government has said, “It’s (referring to the United States) almost handing over legitimacy to the rising powers” while the NY Times reports that anonymous officials are saying the role of the United States is their top concern. Politically, the United States faces an unprecedented amount of political gridlock, and even as candidates prepare for the 2016 election, questions persist as to what the United States should (or should not do) to remain at the top of the ladder. With China introducing a new bank (the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank) and Russia continuing to challenge the established order, the United States faces increased volatility this year and in the future towards its status globally.

Greece

Public sector workers in Greece calling for the debt to be written off (2015).

Greece is in a position that no country wants to be in. It has to choose between providing a safety net for its populations or facing a default on loans. Its debt to GDP ratio has grown from 98% in 2009 to 133% in 2010. Following debt restructuring programs, it is now 175%. The Guardian is reporting that the Greek economy has shrunk by 25% (along with wages) and youth unemployment now stands at 60%. But, the real problem is that if Greece defaults on its loans (or if the Syriza party which came to power by campaigning on anti-austerity decides to take a radical step), Greece could leave the European Union completely (“Grexit”). Other countries have proposed leaving the EU (like Britain where a recent poll found 51% would be in favour of an EU-exit) making a “Grexit” a precedent that other states may follow. If this happens, the future and stability of the European Union changes and the world’s biggest economic experiment faces significant challenges. Socially, Greece faced massive protests before Syriza was elected. If Syriza doesn’t deliver soon — in the form of jobs, standing up to the ECB/IMF or growing the economy — we could see the start of more social explosions in Greece.

The Usual Suspects

The above is only a brief overview of four countries whose volatility and change can bring about immense challenges for the world. However, let’s not forget the usual suspects.

Syria’s civil war has now claimed the lives of 210,000 people. Ironically, the Assad government, who has been embattled against ISIS since the war began, is now receiving indirect support from Western powers. If Western powers begin air strikes against ISIS in Syria, could the end of the Syrian Civil War be nearing?

Iran is in the final phase of signing a nuclear deal with the P5+1 nations that will result in all sanctions being lifted. While there is debate about whether this will pass through the US Congress, there is also challenges as President Rouhani says that sanctions have to be lifted the day the deal is signed. Iran is at a crossroads. If the deal succeeds and sanctions are lifted, Iran gets integrated back into the global economy and the world. If it fails, the deal will be dead in the water for an indefinite period of time, forcing Iran to potentially take radical steps.

Russia faces volatility as its economy reels from Western economic sanctions. The ruble alone has dropped 50% in value (compared to $US). However, the real volatility from Russia comes from its geopolitical actions on the world stage. Selling S-300 Missile Systems to Iran or publicly calling for the creation of a Palestinian state are all strategic geopolitical moves for Russia (they paused the sale of S-300 Missile Systems in 2009 at the request of the United States). It’s actions then, toward countries like China, India, Iran, North Korea, Greece and others, will continue to challenge (and upset) the established order.

Every single region of the world is facing an unprecedented amount of change. Europe has Greece, Germany and Britain to deal with. South America has Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. Africa has Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. Asia has divisions between China, India, Philippines, Vietnam and more. The United States is struggling to define its future in a world that is more and more becoming dominated by multiple powers.

If you are a business, the time has come to start preparing for geopolitical changes around the world. Your revenue, stock price, partnerships, supply chain are all at risk of being disrupted. Start taking steps now by analyzing geopolitical changes, identifying what they mean and integrating them into your broader strategy.

"Startups, here´s why you should ignore competition","The person with a business idea also has a reservation at most times:

“How can I protect my business idea, so that nobody is copying it?”

A statement which has come to my attention a hundred times and more over the last months and years, but nevertheless is not really comprehensible to me.

Here is why…

Particularly in the time of startup and crowd funding many entrepreneurs and initiators ask themselves about the privacy of their own business idea. Quickly lawyers and business administrators appear around the corner with declarations of confidentiality, patents, registered design and utility models or commercial protection rights. It is recommended to sign any agreements by writing — wrongly in my opinion and possibly also detrimental to the development of projects, as I have learned over the last few years.

Many own the idea but only you can bring it to fruition

The initial business idea is always just the tip of the iceberg. Before it seriously ripens in your head it grows in your unconsciousness. An idea is also always the beginning of a journey and never complete right from now on.

But why do we regularly feel chased from those who could copy my own idea? Does nobody else have this idea which is fluttering around my head at the moment?

Simply presume that at least 1000 other people had your idea previously but you are the one who brings it to realization. Than you have still won at the end, haven’t you?

Seriously, if you are the only one than keep the following in mind:

“If your idea is really that simple and easy to copy, than eventually somebody will do just that. Make your business unique instead of keeping it a secret”.

I believe that the idea and the ingenious mind flashes should be discussed with other people from early stages onwards. It helps to validate and to develop the idea further. Competition should simply be ignored and an orientation alongside those basically avoided.

Why do I say so?

Competition is never asleep, that is clear. But please understand that if your idea is really so simply copied than you have not thought it through to the end. As soon as you are in an attractive market, competition is bound to follow suit.

Why is early communication so important?

1. Feedback Sometimes one cannot see the forest due to all the trees. In relation to your idea that means — you are really so convinced by your own idea that you do not sufficiently illuminate it from all sides. Can the idea be realized? What if, when…? Who is your target market? Is anybody really going to buy the product? Are you addressing real problems? Questions over questions which one tends to forget in the heat of the battle. That is human but can have fatal consequences. From an utter illusionary business plan, to the complete product that no one buys, everything is possible.

Are you communicating with friends or associates and are you allowing them to participate? You are automatically minimizing risks. Even better is not to talk to friends but with people who can give a real feedback. Why? Because they look at your idea from the outside and are much more objectively since they are not emotionally tied into it and do not tend to sweet-talk themselves into it either.

Here you will come to understand very fast if you are going home with a pre-order or a few question marks.

2. Learn to pitch One of the highest disciplines in the early stages of an idea founding is the perfect pitch. Maybe you have all nooks and crannies of your idea prepared but you cannot deliver it with one to three sentences to the point. Unfortunate, since that is exactly what the pitch is about… the first explanation, later on at the web-site, in the pitch deck for potential investors and at last but not least, in the relationship with your customers. Through the early communication of my idea, I have come to understand the essence of it. I have taken out this part in accordance and formulate through that my pitch of one sentence.

3. Development and maturity Many cooks do not always spoil the broth. Let yourself be inspired by the feedback and bring your idea through that to maturity.

The reality is turning up differently most of the times. A team creates more complex, better ideas and projects than a single person. This stems from the diversity of the ways in which humans think. Everybody thinks differently, has made his own experiences and can make use of those. That’s why startup weekends work so well.

And if every string attached snaps and the business idea does not withstand any validation, than stick to the words of Albert Einstein:

“If at first an idea is not absurd, there is no hope for it.”

But the competition…!?!

Now that we know why it is important to discuss a business idea with others instead of protecting it, let’s have a look at the aspect of competition. One ground rule can be applied in 99% of all cases:

“Where there is no competition, there is no market.”

The possibility that there is an undiscovered market for a business idea does exist but it is limited. Therefore try to form and formulate your idea as good as possible, so that you can clearly identify your market.

If others are already playing on a smaller scale in that particular market it is a very good point to enter. The market has been recognized by others too.

Foray:

Anybody interested but who has not studied business management, can look at Michael E. Porter’s Five Forces Analysis. Essentially this is the delimitation from competition through cost leadership, differentiation, or focus. Not every variation applies to every business, e.g. one who wants to undercut Amazon with cost leadership will soon discover limits.

Competition is great, saturation difficult

Should your market already have been discovered by competition and at worst already be saturated, than do not make the error and orientate yourself to much on it. Try to find a niche market instead.

Why you should ignore competition:

If you follow a competitor, you will only run after him!

From my own experience I can say, that it is okay to enter a market which does have competition. It is perfectly right to orientate myself, to briefly look left and right. But it is NOT OKAY to try and to copy the competition.

There is one mistake which most business startups walk into when thinking of competitive differentiation: they limit themselves to the differentiation of some features or a concrete product only. But your unique selling proposition (USP) has to be visible from many more different corners and angles. Be different, be unique, and be special with what you do and how you are doing it.

My experience at FastBill

Over the last years I have often enough been stumbling over comparative tables which have contrasted competitors with FastBill. The end result always looked the same: A table, on top some names, in the middle functionalities and at the bottom the line with the prices. Guess what: the table was nearly always the same. Everyone had ticked nearly all the boxes and at the end it was the price difference which decided about victory or defeat. Just as little as these tables are not helping anyone, this type of competition evaluation (only on the basis of price and function) does not help the design of the overall experience. If this would be the basis to enter a market, I would have not been allowed to either start up FastBill or this particular blog. Even before FastBill receipt writing software existed and blogs were written around the topic of startups as well. Whoever hears the sentence “that has been around for a while” has to think about alternative differentiation and how to distinguish oneself and define these aspects. Sometimes these are not to be found on the surface, but show up in the detail. Don’t be deterred but create it differently and to a higher standard!

How to distinguish yourself from competition with the same product

How does it work to differentiate oneself from competition? A general rule of the thumb is — just as in many cases — that it is difficult, if not impossible. Potential points for entry in spite of it all:

Create your business as your own, which means — you should try and undertake everything possible to add a personal or other detail to it and therefore let it be unique. Your customers are not only buying a product, but also a feeling or an experience. “Popcorn in cinema is great but at home on the couch it’s boring.” Same product, different experience.

At the end the mix of brand, product and service will be decisive. Take care that your unique selling point is the first thing your customers are thinking off (the brand) and do not disappoint once you have won them (product and service).

You offer exactly the same product as your competitor? Try to offer something different. Different headline, different pictures, different choice of words, different location. Just because you are wearing the same shoes, does not mean you have to walk the same way.

Success stories — that’s how it can be

The following success stories of well known companies show how their differentiation has stirred attention and generated revenue:

Amazon — Focusing on the simplification of the checkout process and the acceleration of the delivery phase had been unique at the time (and they still are to a certain degree today). Amazon has become worldwide Nr. 1 partly for these specific features.

Zalando — Developing from garage trading to a consumer giant in five years. Nobody would have thought that a business with free returns would ever function. At the beginning Zalando wrote red numbers only but in the last quarter the break-even-point was reached and that with a sales volume of nearly 2 Billion Euros in the last year.

Airbnb — Who would have dreamed of quickly renting ones flat over the internet to strangers in September 2007? With this community-marketplace for holiday flats a revolution unfolded at the time. Nobody believed in it but with the established trust of the Airbnb community this turns out to be a profitable company since seven years now.

Briefly spoken

In the rarest cases it is of advantage to protect ones business idea or to keep it hidden in the dark. Preferably choose communication with your environment and validate your idea. In this way you can improve on the idea and enlighten it from every angle. And once you have decided that your idea turns into reality don’t make the error and run after your competitors. Rather use your time to take care of the special features for your business, formulate them and organize things differently. Only in that way will you draw attention.

Behind the Counter,"The owner of The Crooked Cup reveals his secrets about the Kolache

The Kolache is a Czech pastry that gained its popularity in America in the Czech belt in Texas. It has recently spread across the country with increasing buzz about the flaky, filled pastry. The Crooked Cup in Fort Collins, Colorado serves their version of a kolache and it is amazing. I talked to the owner of The Crooked Cup, Gabriel, about his baking process and his inventive kolaches.

Q: Is there a special process for baking at a high altitude?

A: There are no specifically general answer for this unfortunately, each item has ingredients that react differently to different changes. Higher flour content and a different temperature are suitable changes for many things that we bake, but not all.

Q: How do you make your pastries distinct from the other pastry shops in Old Town?

A: We make ours distinct both by hand crafting small batches and by the fact that we have a culinary trained pastry chef at the helm of everything. Most coffee houses do not have a full bakery, but rather they purchase par baked items and finish them off in an oven.

Q: What would you say is your most popular pastry?

A: Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Kolaches. If you combine all 4 kolache flavors we are extremely close to selling our 100,000th! This will happen sometime in early October.

Q: How did you hear about the Kolache and decide to feature that in your pastry case?

A: My best friend (also a CSU alumni and now a Mechanical Engineering Assistant Professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and I were talking about new and interesting items that no coffee houses had upon our opening. He told me about the traditional Czech version and I tweaked the dough and fillings until we had a product that I was happy with.

Q: When did you eat your first Kolache?

A:3 days before we opened :)

Q: Are there other flavors that you are experimenting with for your Kolaches?

Extirpation and Variation,"Instead of defending my discipline against Khan’s polemic rant, I want to answer a more productive question: What use is cultural anthropology?

Cultural anthropology is useful, I think, because of its focus on two things: mundane life and variation.

People tend to think that their daily lives are unremarkable. Most likely, nothing much happened this week — you went to work, you ate some meals, maybe you spent time with your family or at a religious service. If you are a scientist or employed by one, then you probably spent much of your week in a lab or in the field, doing things that have come to seem ordinary. Pick two people, from different sides of the globe or even different sides of town, and their weeks will look quite different. Dating, driving, working, cooking, walking, spending, and even reasoning vary to a surprising degree.

This variation is the basic fact of culture, and it has serious implications: everything you think you know about human nature could potentially be otherwise. Think marriage is essentially between one man and one woman? See fraternal polyandry in the Himalayas. Think cogito ergo sum? See how people around the world imagine “selves” that divide and circulate through other people and material objects. It doesn’t matter whether particular human features turn out to exist everywhere; the point is that human existence and the stories we tell about it are radically variable. What you see as the bedrock of human nature, someone else sees as a bizarre aberration.

Ordinary life (science included) is a profusion of stories — and stories do not have to be false — that tie together different groups of people, objects, and processes into causal chains and communities. Stories, regardless of their truth value, can have wide-ranging consequences. The stories that cultural anthropologists tell are about other storytellers, and we spend a lot of time working out the consequences of this meta-storytelling: How do we make sense of coexisting, but apparently contradictory, stories? How do we locate stories in the contexts where they are told? How do we track stories in their rise, fall, and variation? How do the reasons people tell stories coincide and diverge?

In cultural anthropology, we tend to tell two broad types of meta-stories: nomothetic and idiographic. Nomothetic stories are law-seeking, looking for general rules that govern variation. Idiographic stories draw out the details of particular cases (which, given the extent of human variation, is not a straightforward as it might sound). The signature of cultural anthropology is a concern with local detail, which we get at through ethnography — long term engagement with the members of a cultural group. I personally tend toward the idiographic (inspired by the goofy man up top, Franz Boas, and his brand of historical particularism), but even for the most abstract nomothetic storyteller, the ethnographic details of culture in all their variation are foundational.

The question is how to tell stories about this variation. Materialist or naturalist approaches like Jared Diamond’s (or Khan’s, for that matter), are “scientific” in the sense that they trace cultural phenomena back to the influence of non-human things: food, genes, environment. They are generally nomothetic, looking for explanatory laws. This approach is not necessarily at odds with cultural anthropology — in fact, it has been a large part of cultural anthropology from its origins. However, materialism alone does not tell the whole story, and it does not exhaust the possibilities for a rigorous and, indeed, scientific engagement with culture. When cultural anthropologists take issue with Diamond, it is not because he aims to generalize, but because we take issue with the ethnographic details he uses to support his claims or the connections he draws between details and general laws.

Good cultural anthropology acknowledges the inevitable fact that research is always part of someone’s mundane life. Scientists and other makers of knowledge are not working from a blank slate. Our interest in culture is itself cultural. Research into culture is not an encounter between a completely objective observer and a subjective “culture,” but rather an encounter between people with different aims, stories about the world, and, often, amounts of power. Instead of attempting to erase ourselves from the scene (in order to claim a dubious form of “objectivity”), cultural anthropologists acknowledge that we are there. There is no view from nowhere, and even the most objective of sciences are built in the daily lives of ordinary people. When studying culture, the object of interest is precisely mundane life, and there is no better starting point than to be there — our methodological discussions in cultural anthropology circulate around just how complicated “being there” turns out to be.

In many cases, our interest in the variety of human experience coincides with political concerns: there is an incredible amount of violence in the world perpetrated against variation in the name of unity (and not only by cultural anthropology’s supposed bogeyman, the straight white European male). As experts in variation, often with longstanding relationships in the communities we study, it is not surprising that cultural anthropologists make for well-informed and passionate advocates.

It is worth noting that there is significant variation within cultural anthropology itself and that the story I tell here is itself one among many, its terms open for debate and revision. This is the view from my little corner of cultural anthropology, dedicated to the varied stories of mundane life. The basic interest in variation, however, is something that I find shared across cultural anthropology (and other forms of anthropology as well). Khan’s inability to see the variety within cultural anthropology might, ironically, be remedied by using some of the methods he so passionately opposes.

In the end, the stories made by cultural anthropologists coexist with other stories, by scientists and non-scientists alike; they do not simply supersede the stories told by “ordinary” people, because we are ordinary people ourselves, and this is not how stories work in practice. Stories sit alongside each other, resonating at some frequencies while diverging in others, they are picked up opportunistically by people with particular aims, and, of course, they vary. There is always more to say, and there is always more than one thing to say.",https://medium.com/anthropology-and-algorithms/extirpation-and-variation-9975f5a42df7,['Nick Seaver'],2015-03-18 17:51:34.784000+00:00,"['Anthropology', 'Storytelling']"
All Together Now: Best Practices in Journalism Collaboration,"This post was adapted from a presentation I gave on journalism collaboration to public radio news directors gathered in Salt Lake City for the PRNDI annual conference.

Collaboration is at the heart of the work we are doing through the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation’s Journalism Sustainability project which is focused on developing a statewide model for a more connected, inclusive, sustainable news ecosystem in New Jersey. We believe that quality local news is critical to healthy communities and that sustainability for that kind of reporting depends in part on collaborating across news organizations and with your community.

Why Collaborate?

I have been building and studying journalism collaborations for years. Back in 2012, I conducted a series of interviews with journalists in a range of very different newsrooms about what was motivating them to explore collaboration. The answers I got then still hold true today:

Rapid Technological Change : Journalism practice has always been tied to technological development. The telegraph ushered in the inverted pyramid, the telephone begat the phone interview, and the always-on cable news channel sparked the 24-hour news cycle. Today’s participatory, Internet driven media gives us better tools than ever to share, connect and collaborate. There are tons of examples, but projects like the Public Media Platform, tools like Slack, and networks like Facebook are obvious ones.

Economic Factors : This new era of collaboration is not just a function of new technology, it’s also fundmentally wrapped up in the economic challenges in American newsrooms. Journalism collaborations present opportunities to share resources, but partnerships are not without their own costs too. Collaboration is not only driven by dwindling resources but also by targeted investments from foundations (and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting) that increasingly make collaboration a focus of their grantmaking.

Better Journalism : Collaborations can create better stories too, otherwise we wouldn’t be interested. Through collaboration you can tap into skills and expertise outside your organization, uncover new story angles, bring in diverse perspectives, and extend the reach and influence of your work. Collaborative journalism projects regularly win awards and have local and national impact.

Collaborative journalism projects regularly win awards and have local and national impact. Strength in Numbers: All the factors above have encouraged an ethos of openness in journalism which some have called “Show Your Work.” By sharing code, project design, engagement models, revenue strategies, and more, we can build on each other’s work, our failures and our successes, to help strengthen the entire field and serve our communities better. Showing your work shifts the industry from partnerships inspired by scarcity to collaborations that leverage abundance.

Newsroom should have discussions about their own motivations for collaboration and what your specific goals are. It’s critical to have agreement internally before your start negotiating a partnership externally. Talk about when not to collaborate: If you have a sensitive scoop should you collaborate? If you are worried about the safety of your source or staff should you collaborate? Understand your collaboration red flags and approach partnerships strategically with buy in and shared values across the organization from management to business to the newsroom.

Collaboration Best Practices

Based on my interviews and case studies here are some of the lessons I’ve gathered from people reflecting on their own collaborations.

Have Clear Goals — Know what you want to get out of it before you go into it. Are you pursuing this collaboration to save resources, enable new forms of reporting, reach new audiences, etc?

— Know what you want to get out of it before you go into it. Are you pursuing this collaboration to save resources, enable new forms of reporting, reach new audiences, etc? Find a Fit — It can be useful to partner with organizations who are different from you, but you need to have some connection to make collaboration work. This is especially true around fundamental ethical issues and values. Collaborations can often feel uncomfortable, but if they feel downright uneasy you may need to walk away.

Build from Trust — A key to finding a fit is establishing trust. Trust in the people, trust in the editorial product, trust in the process.

Relationship Building is Part of the Work of Collaboration — Don’t assume you’ll just build a good working relationship by working together. You actually need to plan for how you will build those relationships as you plan the project. Create space for team building.

— Don’t assume you’ll just build a good working relationship by working together. You actually need to plan for how you will build those relationships as you plan the project. Create space for team building. Document Your Agreements — A Memorandum of Understanding doesn’t have to be a formal legal document, it can be simply a vehicle to make sure you have the conversations you need to have before the project launches.

— A Memorandum of Understanding doesn’t have to be a formal legal document, it can be simply a vehicle to make sure you have the conversations you need to have before the project launches. Communication is Key — Partnerships rise and fall on how well those involved can communicate. Communicating well comes down to both culture and logistics — there needs to be a willingness and good tools in place. Ensure there is one person tasked with managing communications and keeping everyone informed and engaged.

Ensure there is one person tasked with managing communications and keeping everyone informed and engaged. Know Who is in Charge — It seems contradictory to the idea of collaborations, but every successful collaboration — whether it was a one-to-one partnership or a project involving 15 different newsrooms, benefitted from a clear understanding of who the buckstopper was. For some, this means having one project lead, for others it might mean having a clear understanding of who the point person at each partner newsroom is.

Encourage Ownership of Pieces of the Project — Collaboration is rarely about a total sharing of every aspect of a project. Outline who owns which pieces of the project so there are clear roles mapped out from the start and everyone knows how to bring their skills to bear.

Recognize All The Partners — Be a gracious and generous partner and regularly acknowledge your parters. I’m often amazed by how hard this is for newsrooms.

— Be a gracious and generous partner and regularly acknowledge your parters. I’m often amazed by how hard this is for newsrooms. Have Shared Financial Plans — If you are jointly fundraising around a project, or selling sponsorships alongside it later, be sure to have discussed financial agreements with partners early on.

— If you are jointly fundraising around a project, or selling sponsorships alongside it later, be sure to have discussed financial agreements with partners early on. Agree to Timelines — For both the project and the collaboration make sure everyone agrees on timelines and create opportunities for reflection and gut-checks.

— For both the project and the collaboration make sure everyone agrees on timelines and create opportunities for reflection and gut-checks. Start Small and Build Up — Create many small chances to work together with partners before tackling a big high stakes collaboration. Make mistakes early on small projects so you can iron out the challenges before big projects.

Viggo Mortensen on the Tough Lessons He Learned from His Son,"Respect is listening.

I remember staying up late at night as a kid when I was supposed to be sleeping, listening to the radio. I’d listen to it quietly out of necessity — to not be found out. Especially on a school night. I had this idea, which may be true, that I could train myself to hear very low sounds by turning the volume lower and lower and seeing how low I could drop it and still hear.

No is just a word. That’s a good principle.

Life can end at any second, and often does. Which is just a reminder: Pay attention.

What you learn as a photographer is that depending on the angle of the camera, things look different.

The McDonald’s french fry is unbelievable. When you bite into it, you think: It’s so tasty, it can’t be real. As soon as it gets cold, it turns to lard and flubble. I mean, have you ever tried to eat a McDonald’s french fry that’s gone cold? That’s one of the circles of hell. The gulf between the warm, fresh, lightly salted McDonald’s french fry and the cold McDonald’s french fry is as great a gulf as any I know.

A friend is someone who listens to you no matter how stupid the things you’re saying may be.

Life is pretty chaotic. You’re bounced here and there. You really can’t control world events or traffic or the weather or how your body’s going to function moment to moment. You just can’t. No matter how smart you are and how much money you have and how many doctors you see. You really can’t control life no matter how hard you try. But it’s good to take a nap every once in a while.

The same problems keep on coming back at us in different guises.

There are people who go to museums who look at paintings and think: Shit, I could’ve done that. But you didn’t.

Ideally, there is no difference between love and sex.

I don’t think it matters whether you’re married or not. It’s a question of listening and respecting the other person. Not trying to have it all your way, you know?

My son has taught me to forgive. I saw him doing it with me. I saw him accept me even at my worst.

The first teacher is Mother Nature. It starts with: I’m hungry. It ends with: I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe.

The best things are the most sensible.

No curiosity? That’s death. Curiosity is what keeps me going.

People say: Oh, he’s a Method actor. There is no such thing. That’s like peace. What’s peace, you know? What’s Method acting? A method is whatever works.

Laws are there to keep honest men honest.

It’s imposing your dream on others that does damage.

Hippies get a bad name because they make people nervous. There’s nothing wrong with giving a stranger on the street a hug or walking around naked. But once you’re doing it as a political movement, it’s dead.

I think it was Robert Louis Stevenson who said it. “The main thing is to travel hopefully, and the true success is to labor.”

What makes me laugh? Anything that reminds me of what I know in my heart. Which is that life is absurd.

You can read all the philosophers in the world, you can listen to every single person — whether they’re wise or not — you can talk until you’re blue in the face. You can live in a cave, not say anything for years. You can try to clean yourself out completely. In the end, all you have any say over is: What kind of human being am I?

The United Nations. I happen to like that idea. Two words. United Nations. Is that possible? Not entirely.

I could be from New York as well as anywhere else, I suppose.

Drama. People want drama. To provoke it. To watch it. To participate in it. Because it makes them feel alive.

Democracy is a concept. It’s about the process of coexisting. It’s about a relationship. We have this idea that it would be good to get along and learn things from each other. It’s a good idea. But it’s not the final event. It’s not an accomplishment that’s possible to attain and maintain for any period of time.

Speculate all you want. But all you can really know is you. And even you, you’ll never really know.

It’s impossible to survive. But it’s what you do in reaction to that which probably says the most about any given person.

It’s the endlessly entertaining, often ridiculous, sometimes admirable, sometimes embarrassing attempts that some people make to find some meaning in their lives that make life worth living.

Tag, you’re it.

What I Learned in Seven Years of Blogging,"Articles with sniff-of-curiosity drug titles such as this one are tricky. They not only give the readers a false sense of expectations, typical of a Blogging Guru, doling out expert advice to his enthusiastic followers to build rock-star careers, get dream jobs and earn millions. They also do disservice to the act of blogging -an intensely personal activity of mental hygiene, necessary to clear the cobwebs off your thinking head.

I don’t mean to deride the Blogging Gurudom here. Careers, jobs and money — these are noble pursuits and blogging leads the pack of marketing tools available in the Internet to help you achieve them. However, to appropriate blogging as a means to achieve these pursuits alone is limiting.

So dear readers, if you have come here so far expecting some tips to increase your blog followers, let me redirect you to this excellent guide by Amit Agarwal. I will totally understand if you close the window now and read the hyper-linked post containing 20 valuable blogging tips.

With the electrons of the Internet already exploding with “how-to-”’s of blogging everywhere, I have no interest in adding to the clutter. I am more interested in “Why” rather than “How”, because, you see, when the “why” is clear, tackling “how” is simply a matter of diligence.

Please note. This is going to be a really long post spanning more than 2000 words, and I sincerely hope, amidst frenetic distractions desperate for your attention, you would join me in this journey. Grab your coffee, or better, green tea, if you want. I’ll wait for you, before we get started.

1. You are not the content you publish.

In an age where brands are turning into humans and humans are turning into brands, pundits can be seen rallying around social networks exhorting everyone with their clarion call: Publish or Perish! Yet, there can be nothing more uplifting than discovering our intimate space amidst the mad rush to participate in the Procrustean branding exercise which works by chopping off our human selves to snuggle under a catchy brand title — Social Media Guru, Career Coach,and, the latest one, Digital Transformation Consultant.

How do you discover that space of intimacy? At first, alleviate your anxiety by circling over the edges between who you are and what you want to write about. Be generous enough to accommodate the ragged edges of your personality in your writing. As you start respecting the space between you and your writings, your audience would value them immensely.

2. Ideas come and go, but stories stay forever.

We are living in the golden age of storytelling. Living in the digital age, marketers very well aware that stories are the surfboards which help us wade comfortably in the tempestuous ocean of information which surrounds us. But, how does the whole damn thing work?

This is how I understand the story process.

We humans, engage with life through our sense organs and live through a wide palette of experiences. Our human brains reconcile these experiences through the faculties of reasoning and churn out the inner response in the form of facts. By facts, I refer to them, not in the scientific sense, but in the experiential realm. Now, these facts are imbued with various emotions, depending on the feelings we associate with the experiences. Gradually, with the passing of time, the emotional reactions fade away, as the context of our experience changes. Facts recede into memories and fade away in oblivion.

What happens when you start telling stories to your self and others? You start creating a heady narrative cocktail of fictional facts, charged by the electrical impulse of emotions. The brain releases enough dopamine to make the audience remember these emotionally charged facts and re-construct the context through their own ideas and experiences (by a process called as neural coupling). When this happens, the audience lives through the experiences vicariously along with the storyteller.

Haven’t you observed in your own experience how often you tend to forget the plot of the movie you watched, but you can never forget that emotion which was churned by the movie? There is a reason why we never get tired of hearing the great stories of Shakespeare and back home, the epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata. We continuously recreate the context of these stories with the experience of our own lives.

When Vishal Bharadwaj narrated the contemporary politics of Kashmir through the seventeenth century writings of Shakespeare in the blockbuster Hindi movie Haider, our hearts bled in grief as Vishal, in a stroke of genius, brought back the searing agony of the Kashmiri Muslim, weaving the 200 year old “Bhand Pather” Kashmiri storytelling tradition inside the mouse-trap plot-point of Hamlet.

3. Try telling stories wearing a good looking mask

Inspired by the transcendence of stories, as you start narrating them, the first thing you would realize is that you have to find a listener. Listening happens only when the listener is willing to suspend his belief and convince himself that the person telling the story is “not me”. This otherness is crucial, a social contract to let storytelling work its magic upon.

What I’ve learned the hard way in all these years of blogging is that you can create good looking masks, ( Yes, I am talking in plural terms. Who said you could only wear one?) and consciously play around without any fear of them eating your face. What you get in bonus, is that you get to figure out many things about yourself in the whole process. Some people prefer to call this mask, personal branding, but I prefer the term mask, as it reminds me of the conscious choice I make in wearing them, not just in the world of bits, but also in the world of atoms.

I’ve closely observed two people who did this incredibly well, in their unique journeys of self-discovery. One of them later turned out to be a good friend of mine. Long before the age of twitter, he created a fictional character called “Mark Zorro” as a thought experiment to see what will happen if he inhabits this fictional character and explore his inner world. He could voice his thoughts freely, and, in his own words,

..experience the vulnerability of placing my thinking alongside the thoughts of others, but ,to also see if I could construct a way of life for myself that I couldn’t find in a textbook.

The essence of his character was captured in the byline he had created. “Mark Twain wasn’t Mark Twain. Mark Zorro isn’t Mark Zorro”.

Another person who ran this experiment with a wonderful sense of humour was FakeGrimLock. Annoyed by the high authoritarian world of tech blogging, he decided to have some fun and created a minimum viable personality to prove a theory, in his own words…

. .. [that] who you are doesn’t matter. In fact, truth requires that you aren’t anyone, because if you’re someone, whatever you say is always biased. It’s influenced by what you know about that person…It’s the words…not the person that matters

4. Writing is a lot like cooking. And blogging ? Slow-cooking.

You would know what I mean, if you’ve tried your hands in cooking. Sometimes, the dosa doesn’t come in proper shape, no matter what you do and every now and again, the dosa blooms and tastes like the perfect sun-kissed tribute to humanity.

Traditional wisdom treats blogging as an ersatz cousin of writing, and there is a germ of truth in that. When words can disappear into nowhere like foam in the digital ether, you tend to get lazy with words. However, if you approach blogging as a perpetual work-in-progress, it brings in the discipline necessary to bridge the deep chasm between the fluidity of the thought and the solidity of word.

Blogging is an invitation to be a lively raconteur of stories which are born this moment, right now, captured through the rainbow of media available in the palm of your hand.

The real fun begins when these blips-of-consciousness stories, mature and slowly attune themselves with the staccato rhythms of the facts, opinions and reactions which gather around the stories like termites creeping out of wood works. If you feel strongly convinced about the taste, you can package this slow-cooked output for publishing, Or, if you aren’t, you can let your stories simmer more to make it more delicious with time.

5. It doesn’t matter which narrative God you worship

Some time back, Seth Godin wrote a short, insightful post about Clarity Vs Impact. Seth argued that in the longer run, impact is far more important than clarity because, in Seth’s words, “humans don’t use explanations to make change happen. They change, and then try to explain it”

In Seth’s bias for action and impact, I think he has chosen to ignore a lot more happening beneath the surface. Let me share my backstory.

Back in 2007, when I was wet behind the ears in the emerging world of blogging, I devoutly worshiped the narrative Gods of clarity. Enchanted by how the blogging medium mirrored the fluid nature of human perceptions, my blog served two functions, firstly as a chronicle of my perceptions and thoughts as they found expression and secondly as a witness to the kinesis, the movement that unfolds the shift in perceptions over time.

I didn’t care a hoot about who read it ( mostly my friends anyways), how many page-views my blog attracted, and what the audience felt. My blog was my personal expression, and strictly remained so. In my hermetic insulation from the outer world, I never realized that my communication would slowly get afflicted by the curse of knowledge.

Curse of knowledge is the painful realization of the truth that what seems obvious to you isn’t always so, especially when your audience gets lost like Hansel in the woods, unable to follow the trail of bread-crumbs you’ve left for their journey to arrive at where you are currently anchored in your stream-of-thought.

When I clearly understood the nature of my curse, in my futile attempt to reach the middle path (the sweet-spot which manages to create an impact without fogging clarity) , I succumbed to the familiar human habit — jump from one pole to its opposite. I began to embrace the antithesis - the narrative Gods of Impact.

I read everything I could gather to follow the rituals observed to please the Gods of impact, be it priceless advice on writing from the masters, nuggets of tips from the SEO Experts, and ready-made templates of bait-clicking headlines from pros, in my earnest attempt to share and amplify the message.

As I got more enthusiastic to share my message for a widely growing audience, I didn’t notice that I was unconsciously becoming a con-artist, narrating stories deceitfully like Ponzi schemes for the gullible minds. My writing became contaminated with narrative bias.

Image Credits: Sketchplanations Blog

In my attempt to absolve my writing (and thereby thinking) from the curse of knowledge and narrative bias, I’ve begun to focus closely on narratives whose span of influence deeply affected not just my writing, but also my consulting engagements.

Today, I enjoy the irony of zooming in my lens on narratives only after Taleb took enough pains to argue against the perils of narrative thinking with all its biases. Rather than getting cynical about them, I reason to myself, it would be more wiser to leverage the power afforded by them responsibly.

Guess what? When you focus your attention on narratives, it really doesn’t matter which narrative Gods you worship.

6. Are you kicking up dust?

I love Whatsapp. Its no-fluff, ascetic approach to customer experience deeply resonates with me. During 2011, when Whatsapp stood tall among the Top 20 apps in US, during a dimsum lunch with the staff, someone had asked Jan Koum, founder of Whatsapp, why he wasn’t crowing to the press about it. Koum replied,

“Marketing and press kicks up dust. It gets in your eye, and then you’re not focusing on the product.”

Every content marketer worth his salt in the Internet today is waiting to feed you with popcorn content — Looks good, tastes good, atrociously expensive to do, and no nutritional value.

Before you set out to write, it is always valuable to ask yourself honestly, are you kicking up dust?

7. Rumours about the death of blogging are greatly exaggerated.

Blogging in the Internet can sometimes look like playing a game of musical chairs. The Internet keeps arranging the chairs every time differently, and you are always running around them, to the tune of the music (some might say, cacophony and they are right as well) played by the elite band at the top. Every time, when the music stops, and the tune changes, the chairs evolve, and the ones who were caught up with their old ones, fail to move on.

Marketers, and the content cottage industry at large is busy preaching the message — Blogging is dead, tied with their old religious belief that the medium would influence the message, and the slow death of the medium would thereby ring the death knell of the message itself.

No, they are wrong in multiple levels. In the new world, where the message is the medium, bloggers have become the modern day pied pipers, playing in the town square, luring the audience away to their private mountains where they become writers through the shared rituals practiced with them.

The mediums are going to change, every now and then, as the message liquefies further to adapt with the breathtaking diversity of online creative expressions sprawling in the Web. So, in short, you are left with only one choice.

Keep blogging and have fun with everything else, as long as you have the energy to play your own tune, jamming in unison with the music played by the bands out there.",https://medium.com/building-context-and-crafting-narratives/7-learnings-in-7-years-of-blogging-bc5dd8d4dddb,['Venky Ramachandran'],2015-08-07 05:39:42.091000+00:00,"['Blogging', 'Social Media', 'Storytelling']"
Family Interrupted.,"In September 2010 my wife Tara was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. I won’t go into crazy detail here about the immediate aftermath, because I’ve written about this before, but after her initial surgery we packed up our lives from Bali, went on the trip of a lifetime through Europe, moved back to Western Australia, both started new careers and had two beautiful little boys. Every 6 months we would go and get a checkup MRI to make sure the tumour was stable. Everything has been going great — until last month. The fucker appears to be growing again.

Just four weeks after our latest boy Kai came into the world, the checkup MRI has shown about 3mm of growth since the last scan (actually 12 months because we didn’t get MRIs during pregnancy). More concerning is that there is a small amount of contrasting now present in the imaging, which the oncologist panel thinks might indicate faster growing cells. If that’s the case, it could be upgraded from a Grade 2 tumour, to a Grade 3 or 4. Rather than go into the clinical explanations of the grading system, I’ll simply say this would really, really suck.

It has currently been recommended that we go into surgery before the end of the year to ‘debulk’ as much of the tumour as possible and get tissue samples for pathology analysis. The analysis will help confirm any true grading and also indicate what kind of ongoing treatment there may be. It has been suggested that a combination of radio and chemotherapy will be likely recommended.

We’re currently in the process of getting second and third opinions. Last week we flew to Sydney to meet with Prof. Charlie Teo, who is renowned for operating on tumours other surgeons will not, and taking out more than other surgeons would. This is a radical option for us. Prof. Teo has suggested that if we wanted him to take out as much of the tumour as he can, there’s a 5% chance of paralysis and a 15% chance of a permanent speech disturbance (including potentially an entire loss of the ability to communicate). These are very high risks, so until we have a clear indication of what other surgeons can do or recommend we do, then we won’t make a decision.

The next steps are two more appointments. One with a surgeon in Perth near where we live, and the other with a team of brain tumour specialists in Melbourne at the end of November. Once we have all of these opinions on the table, we’ll make the best choice we can for us. The goal on our end is to give Tara the longest and highest quality of life we can. That might sound kind of obvious, but when you’re weighing up, for example, the possibility of living 1 year fully functional, or 2 years paralysed, it becomes quite a tricky decision.

I’ll be posting updates to our journey on Medium once new information is at hand. This will be partly to keep friends and family up to date, partly to help others know what what to expect if they ever have to go through this, and partly for my own form of writer’s therapy.

Stop Tone-Policing,"“My response to racism is anger. I have lived with that anger, ignoring it, feeding upon it, learning to use it before it laid my visions to waste, for most of my life. Once I did it in silence, afraid of the weight. My fear of anger taught me nothing. Your fear of that anger will teach you nothing, also .”—Audre Lorde

What is tone policing?

The concept of tone policing is hard to identify often in line with narratives that preach of “respectability” “professionalism” and “politeness” politics. Tone policing is when there is a lack of understanding of the reasons why women of colour react in an “emotional” and/or “aggressive” manner to acts that they feel are injustices to them. Tone policing is often accompanied by the mindset that “she could’ve said this in a nice way” or “she can have an opinion and not be so aggressive about it”.

The major flaw of tone-policing is that it focuses on “how” something was said, rather than “what” and “why” these things were said.

Tone policing, most of the time is done onto women of colour, most often than not, black women in particular.

“Don’t be in such a hurry to condemn a person because he doesn’t do what you do, or think as you think or as fast. There was a time when you didn’t know what you know today.” —Sir Malcolm X

Tone policing is wrong for many different reasons:

Tone policing does not take into account the experience of women of colour as a marginalized group in society. Their experiences encountering injustices on a daily basis is often undermined and diminished, deemed not worthy of discussion or even acknowledgement they what they experience are hurtful acts.

In fact, most often women of colour are told not react in an emotionally aggressive manner, because their points will not be heard otherwise. This renders their feelings to be less valid, because had they reacted in a “polite” and “respectful” manner, people would hear them, they might even “like them”.

Minaj called out Cyrus’ tone-policing during her VMA speech.

Recently, the feud between Miley Cyrus and Nicki Minaj happened as a result of Miley tone-policing Nicki Minaj. Here are Miley’s original comments to the New York Times that tone-police Minaj:

“If you do things with an open heart and you come at things with love, you would be heard and I would respect your statement. But I don’t respect your statement because of the anger that came with it…What I read sounded very Nicki Minaj, which, if you know Nicki Minaj is not too kind. It’s not very polite.”—Miley Cyrus

This tactic, tone policing, alone attempts to silence women of colour. More than that, it also attempts to centre the tone policer’s feelings on the issue, deeming it more worthy to be heard than women of colour’s voices. Furthermore, tone-policing not only diminishes women of colour’s identity and voice, but also works to deflect the argument, and may even work to make the act of injustice to have been justice all along.

“But you don’t want to know how black women feel about something that’s so important?”—Minaj

One can express anger, and still validly express their point of view on mistreatments and inequities. If you’re tone-policing, you’re saying that your feelings are more important than the oppressed. Most of the time, it’s hard for women of colour to voice their opinions to start, without having to think about your feelings first.

“Code violation for this? I expressed who I am. We’re in America last time I checked.”—Serena Williams

Tennis player Caroline Wozniacki mocks Serena Williams’ body.

It is widely known that Serena Williams is subjected to the most crude racist and sexist comments and treatment due to her being a black woman in a mainly white-dominated sport. The sad reality is that many of those racist comments and even acts come from women. When they should be supporting a fellow female on the field, they mock instead. I don’t see any kindness here.

The hatred and racism that Williams encounters is nothing new. It’s historic. Representation of the black female body throughout history was dehumanized.

Serena Williams said she didn’t feel offended from Wozniacki’s actions, but it still doesn’t mean what Wozniacki did was okay. In fact, it’s this type of behaviour that creates an unwelcoming, hostile and downright an aggressive environment for black women, and women of colour which often leads to the “emotional” and “aggressive” stance that they take on such issues of racism and equality.

“Usually when people are sad, they don’t do anything. They just cry over their condition. But when they get angry, they bring about a change.”—Sir Malcolm X

Anger drives change

Change will not occur if we all react to things in the same way. Here’s the thing, what you may feel is a polite way to express one’s opinions, concerns and experiences might not work for women of colour, solely based on the experience of oppression that they have experienced. Thus, tone policing often is spoken from the voice of the privileged: because you have never experienced and will never experience their experiences of injustice due to the colour of their skin.

Saying that anger is not a form of expression is another tactic that attempts to silence against acts of cruelty and injustice, and thus perpetuates oppression.",https://medium.com/endless/stop-tone-policing-7ff02563d12e,['Rusul Alrubail'],2015-11-02 19:51:28.895000+00:00,"['Women', 'Nicki Minaj', 'Racism']"
Currying & Partial Application,"A lot of blogs posts have been written about partial application and currying. Unfortunately a lot of them get it wrong. There is a widespread misconception about what currying and partial application actually is and there are countless examples in all kinds of languages that are completely wrong. This post is going to set things straight with examples in JavaScript.

Partial Application

What is partial application? Wikipedia tells us pretty straightforward:

In computer science, partial application (or partial function application) refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity.

Arity just means the number of arguments that a function takes (un-ary, bin-ary, tern-ary, …). Doing it manually looks like this:

Here we are fixing a number of arguments (one argument which we called a is fixed to the value 1) to a function (the function add) producing another function (the function inc) of smaller arity (inc takes only one argument).

But we can do much better by using the functional powers of JavaScript and write it this way:

This is proper partial application now. When using underscore or lodash you can use the partial function which is much nicer than the raw bind method. And there is the handy partialRight function which fixes arguments starting from the right which is quite useful since underscore and lodash are doing it wrong.

Currying

Now that we understand partial application we can learn about currying. It is named after Haskell Curry. Wikipedia tells us:

In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments (or a tuple of arguments) into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument (partial application).

That may seem convoluted but once you understand what it all means it’s actually pretty clear.

Consider a logging function that takes three arguments:

log(status, context, message)

If we were to manually write a curried version it would look like this:

Writing it this way has the benefit that we don’t need to use explicit partial application if we want to produce new functions by fixing further arguments. For example:

Currying is really just automating this manual process with the added convenience that we don’t have to use this weird butt-looking syntax if we supply more than one argument at once. Here is an example using the lodash curry function:

Comparison

If it’s still not quite clear what the difference between currying and partial application is maybe it will be clearer with the following example. Consider a variadic function, i.e. a function that takes any number of arguments, like the (s)printf string formatting functions for example.

function format(format, ...args) {

// fancy formatting code here

}

We can’t really curry this function unless we fix its number of arguments but we can use partial application. For example:

Essentially the observable difference between currying and partial application is that a partially applied function will always delegate to the original function when it is called, a curried function only does so once all the arguments have been supplied. See this silly example for demonstration:

And now the curried version:

tl;dr

Currying is not partial application. It can be implemented using partial application. You can’t curry variadic functions (unless you fix the number of arguments, i.e. making it non-variadic).

I Don’t Wanna Talk About It,"Since I announced the release of The Church Next Door and started my mission, I’ve had a lot of people contact me. Some people share their experiences, some looking for help and others showing their support. I love it. It gives me the assurance that I’m doing the right thing and the drive to keep moving forward.

I noticed something though.

I’ve known a lot of these people for years. Some I’m very good friends with. Yet, I’ve never had a real religious talk with them. Now all of a sudden I am? Once I opened the door to this “unspoken” topic it was easy. We were all of a sudden comfortable talking about it when we wouldn’t have before.

Why do we push the subject of religion to the side even with our closest friends and family? Shouldn’t we be having these conversations?

I know, I know. Religion is a touchy thing to bring up, especially in today’s society. But now that I’ve gone public, I believe society is much more spiritual than it looks. We hide it because we think we may offend others. But with friends and family? I think we can all say we’ve had conversations that has upset one another and still remained close. Yet, we’re still scared to talk about religion like it will end every relationship instantly.

I thought I knew my friends well before, but now I’m learning things about them I never knew. We’ve grown closer. It’s amazing. Talking with them has helped me grow and I know it will lead to a deeper relationship with each and every one of them from now on. We (or at least I do) feel like we have another person to go to with our future struggles. We have someone that really cares about our wellbeing. Neither one of us may have the answers but having someone there to support you in that way is a BIG THING.

I’m really glad I went public with this “touchy” subject. It turns out it’s not so touchy after all.

Please share this with everyone you know. The more people that know my story, the more people I can help.

On altered orbits,"As far as change management challenges are concerned, Galileo Galilei was faced with one of the toughest ones going. Unfortunately for him, it didn’t go too well.

Between 1615 C.E. and 1632 C.E., debate was raging about whether the long-held view first put forward by Aristotle was still a valid one, that the Earth was the center of the universe.

As an alternative, theories that had been developed by Nicolaus Copernicus between 1511 C.E. and 1546 C.E. were suggesting it was the Sun around which all else orbited, an idea that was known as ‘heliocentrism’.

Galileo, who was called the ‘Father of the Scientific Method‘, defended heliocentrism. It was a stance that set him against the perceived teachings of contemporary scripture generally, and against Pope Urban VIII, who was Pope at the time, in particular.

In 1632 C.E., an Inquisitorial commission in Italy declared heliocentrism to be ‘foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture.’ This is a copy of their original pronouncement.

Faced with a changing world view (quite literally in his case), Pope Urban and his Inquisition reacted out of anger and fear. Galileo was put under house arrest, which is how he lived until his death, a few years later.

This is a classic story about the clash between faith and science, facts and beliefs. Yet, we know today that a changing world view is part of life. Without ideas, innovation cannot exist. New knowledge is continually causing us to revise previously held assumptions as we evolve.

An exponential rise in human possibility is being created from code that asks us to be teachable. As the world gets more wired up and connected, a human ability to learn and adapt, using initiative and all the information and frames of reference available, is an important part of our response to it.

That trade-off between facts and beliefs is in some ways a distraction. Because, at its core, emergence is neither one nor the other. It is a next-generation synthesis of both, reconciling the previously unreconcilable, going beyond them and ushering in new horizons that had been unimaginable before.

When entrenched views and methods are challenged by emerging ideas, it can be hard to give up old assumptions and respond to them positively. But if we were still thinking the earth was the center of the universe, imagine how much of the last five centuries of progress we would have been missed as a result of that rigid thinking.

Holding onto industrial economy ideas in a connected age is very similar. With code, we have an altered orbit. It is asking us to think about how we revolve around it in ways that are fit for today’s age.",https://medium.com/emergent-code/on-altered-orbits-71f38c39efa8,['Anne Mccrossan'],2015-11-23 10:58:10.624000+00:00,"['Science', 'Religion', 'Digital Transformation']"
Is not technology that’s tearing us apart,"The increased use of social media is being portrayed as responsible for bringing the worst humanity has to offer. Is not rare to find whole campaigns against the use of such tools because they lead to “negative behaviour” that’s responsible for pushing people further apart as days passes by.

Well, social media are not guilty, they only enhance society’s values that were stimulated previously, but not faster enough for it to backfire in our faces. How can we accuse communication tools of being responsible for turning people lonely, vain, lazy, or hypocritical, if we receive strong cultural pressure to become a “successful member of society” using exactly those same values?

“You are special”; “Nothing’s ever so bad that it can’t get worse”; “It’s not difficult if you try hard enough”; “There’s nothing impossible if you have enough willpower”. Those are lies we heard since childhood, but through life, those fantasies reveal themselves as being demonstrably false.

We are taught that only strong people are successful in life, weakness is evil, achieving happiness is the most important goal, happiness is only possible through money and power, and they can be acquired getting a good job, by doing so, society will respect you, you’ll be happy and suffering will go away.

Land of fantasy promised in our childhood.

Social media opened a whole new way to expose who we want others to think we are, it’s a smoke screen for a sad, pathetic life that we are too powerless to change or cope with. Those values praised and stimulated by culture are applied to a real time battlefield for happiness and welfare, leading people to ignore their most inner feelings of regret, sadness and loneliness, to create the image of a successful-respectable-admirable-role-model citizen.

It’s not social media’s fault that we exult values that lead people to seek an unreachable standard of life that forbid them to feel in all its fullness, creating machines that seek nothing but achieve business goals, isn't it time for people to start changing this mindset?",https://medium.com/quarto-escuro/is-not-technology-thats-tearing-us-apart-986e5180be76,['Murilo Costa'],2015-03-17 16:05:56.818000+00:00,"['Narcissism', 'Stupidity', 'Hypocrisy']"
The digital nomad lie,"by Yann Girard

I’ve now been traveling and working remotely for the past three and a half months. Or at least I’ve tried to.

I don’t call myself digital nomad. And I’m not a true digital nomad. Whatever a true digital nomad really is. I just wanted to see what it’s like.

Over the past few months I’ve been to Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia.

And while trying to visit all of these amazing places I was trying to keep all my other stuff going, as well as some new ideas I wanted to work on for quite some time.

And what I’ve learned is that it’s almost impossible to build anything from scratch while trying to travel and enjoy life at the same time.

It’s already super tough to build anything while you’re at home. In an environment you know. Where you know your obstacles. But trying to build something while traveling is so much harder.

When you travel everything is amplified. The distractions. The things to do. The things to see. New people. New places. The barriers. The unknown. The obstacles. Everything. All the time.

And all of this stuff you’re reading online on how awesome it is to be a digital nomad is basically a lie. It’s a lie to sell you a product. Or a lifestyle. Or a service. Or a coaching session. Or whatever.

People are trying to sell you the dream. Or the lifestyle package. Or the freedom package. Or the whatever package. For just $99 a month.

I ask myself over and over again since when we were able to buy freedom online. Since when we could buy freedom with just a few clicks.

And even more importantly why should we even pay for freedom? I always thought freedom was a basic human right. And basically for free..

It’s indeed a strange world we’re living in.

Don’t get me wrong though. I’m really, really grateful for this time and all of the incredible things I’ve learned and experienced. It was an amazing time. It really was.

I just want to share the things I’ve learned over the past few months to paint a more realistic and more honest picture of what it might really look like to be a digital nomad.

# working on the beach

All of these pictures you see online where people work on a beach are just BS. If you’ve ever tried to just check your emails while you’re in the sun, without an aircon, you’d know that you’d die after just a few minutes.

Working on a beach without an aircon is just not possible. As a matter of fact working anywhere in these dream locations without an aircon is absolutely impossible.

Don’t believe it? You don’t have to. Just try to work outside in your home country during summer time for an hour or two. And you’d instantly understand..

# work & travel

Every time you change your location you’ll lose a few days. Well, it’s not actually losing time but it’s time you can’t use to work. Because you’ll want to explore the city.

Even if you don’t want to, you’d have to figure out a few basic things like where to buy stuff, where to go to eat and so on. After all you don’t want to eat Mc Donald’s all the time, right?

Changing location more than every two weeks makes it almost impossible to get a work routine going. It usually took me about two days until I was able to get back into the flow when I moved from one place to another. Sometimes even more, if I didn’t really like the city. Or ended up in a shitty hostel.

Just think about how hard it is to get your work done anywhere else than the office. Sometimes you might be able to work from home.

But only when you have the perfect setting. It gets soooo much harder to get anything done when just a few things just don’t feel right..

# housing

Finding a good place to stay where you can live and work at the same time will also take a hell lot of time. And searching online just doesn’t work for most of the places.

Sure, you can go on AirBnB. But they just don’t have many real flats on it. At leat not at the places I’ve been to. It’s usually hostels trying to sell their dorm beds.

And even if there were some apartments on AirBnB, the good ones were usually always fully booked.

And staying in hostels and going to work at a coworking space or local coffee shops is also not a real option. I tried it. More than half of the time I stayed in hostels.

And the sleep you get there just isn’t real sleep. You’ll be too tired the next day to get some real work done. Even with earplugs..

And you don’t want to buy 5 coffees at Starbucks every single day. Unless you have an unlimited budget. Just like staying in a hotel all the time will get too expensive for most of us.

# isolation

The only way I was able to get some stuff done was when I completely isolated myself from everything that was going on around me.

When I finally found an apartment I could rent short term or a nice place to stay where I could focus 100% on my work.

Or just like right now.

I’ve spent the past two days sitting in the lounge of a hostel where others come to socialize.While everybody was having fun, drinking and going for parties, I was working.

During these past 3.5 months I went out partying maybe twice.

The thing is this:

When you want to get stuff done, when you want to build (and not just manage) something, you just can’t do what everybody else is doing.

You have to focus on your own shit. Otherwise you could have stayed at home..

# loneliness

I call bullshit on everyone who says that being a digital nomad is like living the dream. It’s one of the hardest things out there.

And it can be very lonely. I just don’t think that most people are ready for this. Most people don’t know how to spend quality time with themselves anymore.

And if there’s one thing I think that disqualifies almost everyone for being a digital nomad it’s this.

If you’re not able to be alone a lot, then being a digital nomad is definitely not for you.

# routine

One of the most important things to get stuff done is to have a routine. And it’s sooo hard to get a routine up and running when you’re constantly changing places.

I found this to be THE most important thing for me to get going. To have something I do EVERY day. What helped me sooo much to keep on going was to write and publish one blog post every day.

No matter how many hours I spent traveling in a bus, no matter what obstacles I encountered during the day, I always pushed myself to do this one thing.

And once I did it, I was usually able to do some more thing. I think if you don’t have a routine, you won’t be able to make it work.

# successful digital nomads

Here’s the thing.

The digital nomad hype is filled by people making money selling you the dream. The dream of how amazing it is to be a digital nomad.

I think it’s safe to say that there’s a digital nomad bubble.

Just show me one successful digital nomad who is making a living without trying to sell you his lifestyle. Or her freedom package. Or whatever online course to change the world. Or whatever tickets to whatever digital nomad conference.

The really successful digital nomads, the ones you’ve probably never heard of, the ones who don’t brag about being a digital nomad, are usually the ones who just do it and don’t talk about it. The ones who just do their thing.

# freelancing

The only thing I see how being a digital nomad might work out is to freelance. But this doesn’t work over night. It needs years and years to make a name for yourself.

You can’t just quit your job and start freelancing from an island tomorrow.

You need to build your network first. And your portfolio of clients. And this will take a lot more than just buying an online course on how to build a freedom business..

# managing vs. building

What might also work is to just manage an already well running business. A business you’ve already built BEFORE you became a digital nomad.

Starting an online business from scratch, starting anything from scratch while traveling and enjoying life at the same time is just not possible.

Unless you’re trying to sell people your lifestyle (or the digital nomad lifestyle). Then it’s another story. Because it works. It’s probably the only thing that really works.

That’s why most of these so called digital nomads choose that path. And I’m not blaming them. I do the same. And I’m a strong believer in doing the things that work.

I just feel that it’s good to know a few things before you buy into the digital nomad hype. Before you become a believer. Before you believe in the digital nomad hype..

Greek elections: do Syriza want to win?,"Alexis Tsipras’ final election rally had the usual soundtrack and familiar props but a different cast. After more than a fifth of his MPs split to form a new left party, the inner core of party activists behind the stage were nervous. Would anybody more than the party faithful come?

Tsipras in July signed a third austerity memorandum with Greece’s lenders. Committed to massive privatisation, spending cuts and handing the Eurozone a veto over future legislation, a significant number of the party’s activists have quit.

Some have joined Popular Unity, led by veteran Syriza leftwinger Panyotis Lafazanis. Others have just chosen to sit outside the official structures.

Though Tsipras has been mobbed on his election tour, and is even now neck and neck with the conservative party New Democracy, both on 31% in the last poll, its clear some of the magic has gone from the Syriza phenomenon.

The first far left government in modern Europe lasted just six months: bludgeoned into submision by the closure of its banking system, and plagued by tactical mistakes with a single source — Tsipras’ refusal to believe the Europeans would themselves refuse a compromise.

The crisis of June-July 2015 revealed two things we didn’t previously understand about the Euro: first that the major powers of Western Europe have less say in its running than Germany in alliance with Slovakia, Latvia, Finland and Estonia. Many people in those countries feel that the Eurozone could become a bottomless pit for profligate nations in the periphery. They would in turn argue that the Eurozone has transformed into a machine for creating jobs in Germany and destroying them across southern Europe, and for shrinking the Eurozone’s GDP. Still, the second revelation is that the majority of Greeks would rather have the Euro plus austerity than leave the single currency.

It was trapped inside these two new realities that Tsipras had to make a choice in July, and he chose first to sign the memorandum; second to impose tough party discipline on those who were trying to mobilise resistance to his strategy.

Though it was certain he would lose the hard left of his party, it was the imposition of discipline — and alleged negative briefing — that drove parts of his own support group in the party away: half of Syriza’s youth organistion left, together with charismatic parliamentary speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou.

Ms Konstantopoulou told me: “The conclusion that could be drawn from Tsipras’ decisions is that the left cannot do anything. Tsipras has grave responsibility making people believe that. The lesson of Greece is that you should never, ever stop struggling. There was a huge group of people across the world saying ‘This Is A Coup’.”

Ms Konstantopoulou is standing for the new Popular Unity party, which opposes the terms of the bailout, and told me she was looking forward to leaving the office of speaker which has “been like a prison”.

For the wider left — not just in Greece but across Europe — the task is to work out how to pursue an anti-austerity strategy within the Eurozone. Their answer is to democratise its institutions, placing the ECB under the control of, and subordinate to, governments and using the poverty and human rights principles written into the EU’s treaties to set limits to the austerity countries can be forced to do.

Most of the people who will lead that anti-austerity movement in Europe were on stage with Tsipras last night. Pablo Iglesias, leader of the Spanish Podemos party, gave a rousing speech; Grigor Gysi, veteran leader of the German Left Party was cheered wildly as he slammed Merkel — whose image in Greece remains unchanged by the recent refugee crisis. Ska Keller, figurehead of the Greens in the European parliament also made a speech. Sinn Fein sent greetings.

For Tsipras these gestures were critical. Many among the European left have been highly critical of his climbdown in June — and critical in detail of the way Syriza ran the government: too slow to attack the oligarchs, too ready to “play the game” of power, and with too few democratic checks on the decisions of Tsipras and his inner circle.

Tsipras has promised to do more, and faster, if he is given a new mandate. But if the polls are right it will be a different coalition. Even if Syriza becomes the largest party on Sunday night, the ebbing of support for its former right wing coalition partner ANEL means Tsipras would have to seek a coalition with pro-austerity parties of the centre: the rump of Pasok (the Greek Labour Party) and the Blairite group Potami.

Tsipras is struggling to win tomorrow not just because his own party has fractured but because the conservative ND party has installed a softer, more liberal leadership. All it will take for Syriza to lose is probably that its own supporters don’t bother voting (many Greeks have to travel to their place of origin to vote), or a few key Athenian middle class districts switch back to ND, as they did in June 2012.

One question always on the minds of Syriza watchers is: do they want to win. It’s never admitted publically but insiders say they tactically threw the election of 2012 because Tsipras thought they were not ready.

Last night I managed to catch a few brief words with Mr Tsipras as he came off stage, visibly exhilarated and surrounded by a rolling scrum of security guards and wellwishers. He said:

“I feel vindicated by this event.” I wondered for a moment what he was referring to and then George Kiritsis, the editor in chief of the party’s newspaper, got his cellphone out and showed me the top-shot of the rally.

It had been huge. Syriza’s voters had easily filled the square.

Twice as Many Appointments in Mali,"Umu Bouare isn’t the only hairstylist in her village, but she has to be the most likable. Sitting on the quiet, well-shaded porch of her home, she welcomes customers in with an infectious smile; it’s no surprise that she has multiple appointments each day.

For women in this community, coming to see Umu isn’t just about having their hair styled for an event or a feast — they also come to relax.

“I do their hair and we talk together,” Umu explains, laughing.

“Because of the water taps, we have time to earn money and do other things — even take a rest. We didn’t think this day would ever come.”

That’s the part of her job she loves: the social aspect.

Sure, it provides income that she can use to buy clothes, food and shoes for her family, but the real highlight is the chance to connect with other women in the community, to make them feel beautiful.",https://medium.com/charity-water/umus-story-99e7f6ce7a0e,['Charity'],2015-02-25 18:58:56.804000+00:00,"['Clean Water', 'Africa', 'Hair']"
Working The Jobs That Must Stay Open Over The Holidays,"by Anonymous

Last year, the lead up to Thanksgiving felt dominated by stories about retailers adding Thursday evening hours to extend Black Friday sales. There was, of course, an ensuing backlash, including Change.org petitions and social media posts decrying the burden these hours placed on workers and their families (and the backlash to the backlash that I saw on social media, at least, arguing that the workers chose to take these jobs, etc.). REI’s announcement about 30 days before Black Friday that they and their employees would be opting out this year was a welcome contrast.

While I personally hope this helps quell the Black Friday creep, I’d like to call attention to all the workers, not merely those in retail, who have to work major holidays.

For many years I worked on a 24-hour crisis hotline for crime victims, where we were required to work 33–50% (depending on the year) of the big six: Thanksgiving, day after Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Years Eve, New Years. Working on holidays that are important to you is not fun; there is no getting around that, and very little mitigating of it. I think my organization did a pretty good job of addressing it. Getting time-and-a-half certainly helped. For more mundane holidays like Presidents’ Day, we actually competed to get the shifts, since it was a real paycheck boost.

There are no perfect fixes if your work must stay open every day of the year, but staffing/scheduling policies can help. Everyone had to put in their requests off by a certain date so they could all be fairly evaluated in total. We knew the number of major days we need to each cover, so no one person got stuck with all the holidays. I’ve heard stories about places where it was all based on seniority, which meant a few people got every holiday off and a few people got stuck working terrible hours every major holiday; and about places where requests were honored in the order received, which also had the effect of freezing a few people out of any holiday off.

Because my colleagues were amazing, everyone was generous with helping each other have a workable schedule. Rather than fighting over which holidays we personally wanted off, we fought over whether someone was taking on more than her fair share and deserved more days off. I’m very grateful to my colleagues who didn’t celebrate Christmas who jumped in to make sure the days around the 25th had coverage.

For me at least, the main thing that helped was that I had such a sense of purpose in being there on the crisis hotline on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s. No matter what, no matter when, if someone needed us, we were there. Always. I always found that to be magical. But it was never easy. If you think it’s hard to find someone emergency shelter on a normal day, it’s a thousand times harder on Thanksgiving. Somehow the most urgent needs seem to surface on the most challenging days.

The other saving grace was always my colleagues. We orchestrated elaborate potluck Thanksgiving feasts, usually with way more food than we could consume. I’m particularly grateful to one colleague who didn’t work on the the hotline directly, but who came by every Thanksgiving, usually with several homemade pies. He always had other places to be, dinner to get to, friends to visit, but he made a point to block out a solid part of the day to be with us and concretely show he appreciated what we were doing.

Feeling appreciated and acknowledged in the moment made a huge difference to my morale. If you do encounter someone working on a holiday, please know that taking a moment to thank them does matter.

My first year working after college in a new city hundreds of miles from home. It was a particularly cold, snowy Christmas, and because I relied on public transit that was running few buses during the holiday schedule, I had had a long, cold commute (waiting outside for a connection for 20+ minutes). I was woefully underprepared for my shift; I had brought a regular dinner and hadn’t realized how awful it would seem to eat a Lean Cuisine on Christmas. I’m not sure what I was thinking. I had planned to treat myself to a fancy drink at the nearby chain coffee store, only to discover that, of course, it was closed.

Looking back, it’s comical, but at the time I remember feeling close to tears as I prepared to microwave my dinner and contemplated the commute back. Before I started, though, one of my colleagues who was on shift that night, arrived with Chinese takeout for everyone, and kept us company over dinner. It completely turned the day around for me, and I’m still so grateful to her six years later for this generous surprise on a day when it meant so much. Though I was far away from my family, particularly difficult just out of college and far away for the first time, I was surrounded by a different kind of family.

Which brings me to my next point: I’m also incredibly lucky in that my family bent over backwards to make this work. That first year when I worked Christmas, my parents and siblings came out and stayed in my apartment. We were always a family that opened presents on Christmas, but that year we did it on Christmas Eve. Another year, we all flew to Disney World on Christmas so that I could work through Christmas Eve. Side note: flying on Christmas is actually really nice! No one does it, so it’s much less stressful than traveling during the lead up.

The contrast from crisis hotline to Magic Kingdom made for a bit of a culture shock, but it also made Disney perhaps more magical than usual. That same year we celebrated Thanksgiving a week early so that I could work over that holiday. My mom was a nurse before moving into instruction/administration, which made her familiar with alternative schedules, and we have always prioritized time as a family rather than dates on a calendar when it comes to celebrating.

All that said, I do not want to give the impression that I didn’t mind working these days, that it didn’t negatively affect me, or that I didn’t sometimes (often?) have a bad attitude about it. In some ways it helped that this was my first job out of college, so it was my normal. I now appreciate my flexibility that much more.

However, when I worked during the holidays, I preciously guarded the holidays I did have off. I wanted to make each day really count. That New Year’s Eve at Disney World I got unreasonably stressed out and frustrated with a colleague who got confused about the backup schedule and called me. I just wanted to go dance at the China pavilion at Epcot.

Even though I felt at the end of my rope and in need of that break, I should have been more patient. The truth is, it takes a toll: being away from family, feeling closed out of something that was part of your life since you were a child, is hard.

While I’ve heard people say that if you work on holidays, you likely knew you’d have to before you took the job, it really is more complex than that. Many people take those jobs because they have no choice. That doesn’t mean they don’t want to be with their families.

Others, like me, maybe had a choice, but are doing jobs that can’t be paused. It’s easy enough to address the retail situation since stores really don’t need to be open on Thanksgiving. But what about people working in nursing homes, emergency rooms, homeless shelters, poison control, crisis lines, fire departments? I’m not touching deployed service members here, because I know that’s a sacrifice that goes well beyond what I experienced.

I applaud efforts to curb consumerism and corporate desire for profit, and instead prioritize workers being able to be with their families on holidays, but that only addresses part of the workforce. There will always be people doing jobs that can’t ever close, and we need policies that support and protect these workers too wherever possible.",https://medium.com/the-billfold/working-the-jobs-that-must-stay-open-over-the-holidays-31ec3754ff1d,['The Billfold'],2015-12-09 23:40:28.605000+00:00,"['Holidays', 'All Of The Jobs', 'Disney']"
Review: The Psychology of Strategy,"I am sometimes prone to hyperbolic praise of books and authors (as I am to equally equally hyperbolic criticism of them) so take this with an grain of salt. But I can say without further reservation that Kenneth Payne’s The Psychology of Strategy is a book that might just help us repair and rebuild what is sadly an increasingly broken discipline.

Payne, a trained political psychologist, uses political psychology to analyze the ways in which the US blundered in Vietnam. As Payne notes, the methodology is not scientific — it merely uses well-known psychological notions as a way to frame possible explanations for strategic decisionmaking. However, the work does open up some room for a broad explanation of strategy as a cognitive activity.

Several themes emerge that I feel are very important: cognitive and evolutionary underlays to strategic decision making, the importance of strategy as a group activity, and pathological problems in modeling the opponent.

First, as my professor William Kennedy has observed in his work on fast and frugal decisionmaking in agent-based models, agents should be assumed to have rapid and resource-efficient modes of decision behavior that correspond to meeting needs in the decision environment. More broadly, anyone modeling human behavior should not assume that humans are purely random or general-purpose computers. Too often strategy assumes the strategist as a kind of disembodied strategy machine that lacks any broadly cognitive or “hardwired” mechanisms of decision behavior. Payne’s book focuses expressively on both strengths and weaknesses in human rationality and its impact on military decisionmaking.

Given that Lawrence Freedman’s book has looked at distinctions of different design idioms for strategy (e.g. “strategy from below” of Marx and Gramsci and others vs. more traditional military-strategic behavior), one interesting follow-on research topic would be to understand what kind of images of human decision behavior each of Freedman’s strategic design idioms seemingly presume.

Second, agents respond to how both the external environment (nature and other agents) as well as their own behavior affects their state. Strategy is implicitly cast as an individual activity in both standard conceptions of a “master strategist” or a game-theoretic agent, but the problem is that strategy is a messy group activity characterized by reciprocal causation. Agents may seek esteem within the group or be influenced by group norms, but their actions also influence the group state as well as the external environment.

Payne successfully argues that while to political scientists this is subsumed into “groupthink” or “bureaucratic politics” or even “two-level games,” that conception fails to get at the cognitve and emotional implications of strategic decision behavior. I thought this was a particularly apt criticism given that levels of analysis in social science research concerning this is terminally inconsistent. The use of social psychology and identity theory is particularly of interest here.

Finally, conceptions of the “enemy” and how it will respond to adversarial stimulus are frequently wrong, sometimes horribly so. This comes out especially during the sections on airpower in the book. A big challenge, which I think is under-explored by strategic researchers, is showing how a system of one agents can reason about how to impact and effect the other adversarial system in the manner desired. Payne looks at this quite a bit, but due to the focus of his book on the US one does not see how it is reflected in opponent behavior.

On the whole, despite Payne’s own admitted limitations, his book is an prominent template for how strategy might be rebuilt. Instead of a heroic image of the strategist or the strategy-making organization that we will be perpetually disappointed by, focus on the nature of strategy-making as it often is: messy, biased, fraught with emotion, and a product of our own very own flawed humanity.",https://medium.com/rethinking-security/review-the-psychology-of-strategy-cc18456397e,['Adam Elkus'],2015-05-17 05:13:28.598000+00:00,"['Strategy', 'Review', 'Psychology']"
Gospel for Vagabonds,"Gospel for Vagabonds

Something about impermanence.

I know what it’s like to wish to move constantly. To believe that motion brings comfort and that journeying is your meditation, your most significant nutrient, and the definition your very core. There is stability to be found in the purchasing of bus tickets, the neverending museum lines, the wearing down of your favorite boots from too many cobblestone streets and dirt paths, the constant weight of a backpack on your shoulders, and beers shared between strangers.

That was me, until two years ago. I stumbled upon a person whose presence put my anxieties to rest. The very anxieties which had for years caused me to shake in my Nikes and throw my MasterCard at the Amtrak ticket window. Fight or flight, right?

I found calmness and satisfaction in standing still with them, and that’s not to say that we have not shared many adventures. However, for a short while, I had convinced myself that the life I had once imagined for myself was not what I wanted entirely, anymore. And there is nothing wrong with changing your mind. I am still only 21 years old. I have plenty of time to figure these sorts of things out. Love can show you things that you had never before even imagined wanting. In a way, it was my newest adventure. And it isn’t over yet, but in my time away (in Morocco, in case you’re new here), I learned a lot about impermanence.

I took a risk in leaving, but it was one I had to take — for myself, for my relationship, for the sake of my education, career, and future etcetera. I reaffirmed that motion and travel makes me inexplicably happy. That opportunity can flee.

People talk a lot about unconditional love, but maybe that’s where we’re wrong. Maybe in demanding that the weight be carried no matter the strain is what prevents us from truly being happy. It’s important to remember how to take care of yourself, even while maintaining the love you have for others. Taking it day by day and riding out the adventure is more often than not the remedy when people, such as myself, invent problems and let their anxieties get the best of them.

I’ve come to learn that adventure is still my sustenance and that this relationship is an adventure all its own. However, I mustn’t forget that I am still me, and that requires constant redrawing of my life itinerary.",https://medium.com/philosophy-logic/gospel-for-vagabonds-8cbea2d932f9,['Joy Cohen'],2015-12-28 20:38:16.339000+00:00,"['Relationships', 'Travel', 'Short Story']"
When was the last time?,"“You’re starting to lose the magic.”

“Excuse you?” She looked up at him, raised her eyebrows up a notch.

“Tell me, when was the last time you randomly walk into a flower shop? When was the last time you spend your time watching the sky turning from yolky orange into an indigo dusk? When was the last time you sit in a coffee shop, staring at all those passing cars outside and thinking about dusty dawn?”

Alaska paused. She opened her mouth but none came out of it. She inhaled deeply and stutters, “I…I don’t know what to say.”

“Do you remember you used to talk poetry? You used to listen with your ears, your eyes, and your heart. You were a wizard with the pointy hat from across the road, happily playing with those cats and raindrops, you used to wave away your wand, saying hi to every passerby. You used to smile at strangers,” he continued as she stares blankly at the sky, avoiding his gaze.

He chuckled, knowing what’s on her mind. He knew this time she couldn’t deny his sentence. “You carried around your crayons, you loved the white one as if it’s the last man standing that guards its legacy bravely. You used to talk about it so happily I saw rainbow in your eyes.”

“I… I don’t know. It feels like all of my emotions are sucked into a blackhole of nothingness,” said Alaska. Her voice started to tremble. She hated it so much to face the fact that he’s right, “I don’t know what should I do?”

“Breathe,” he put his hand on her shoulder, giving her a sympathy pat. “Invite your melancholy outside for a stroll. Take photos. Read a poem. Or write one.”

“Find the magic dust!” he said, enthusiastly. He called out the Alaska he used to know. He knew that deep down somewhere, she’s there.

Analysis of the Hiking Discourse,"by Lian Harrington

Hiking is described as long walks on trails in more rural areas. Hiking comes with its own sign systems, values, beliefs, and ways of dressing. James Paul Gee, in his article “Literacy, Discourse, and Linguistics: Introduction” in the Journal of Education, defines this kind of combination as a Discourse. He writes

“Discourses are ways of being in the world; they are forms of life which integrate words, acts, values, beliefs, attitudes, and social identities as well as gestures, glances, body positions, and clothes”.

For one to be a part of the hiking discourse they must dress, act, and have the same values as those who are fluent in the discourse.

Identifying the Discourse

Hiking is a secondary, nondominant Discourse. Darcy Fiano paraphrases what Gee writes about secondary Discourses in her article “Primary Discourse and Expressive Oral Language in a Kindergarten Student”, saying “ secondary Discourses are those acquired through the various social institutions that we participate in beyond our home environment”. Thru-hiking is picked up or learned when one is older and many times through interactions with others. It does not bring with it any wealth or status outside of the hiking community and therefor I would categorize it under a nondominant Discourse. Gee describes a nondominant Discourse as one that “ brings solidarity with a particular social network, but not wider status and social goods in the society at large”. Thru-hiking fits into the nondominant Discourse description because it doesn’t bring any wider status or social goods outside of the Discourse.

How to enter the Thru-Hiking Discourse

One can enter the thru-hiking discourse in a few ways. The first is through apprenticeship. Gee writes that discourses are learned “by enculturation (“apprenticeship”) into social practices through scaffolded and supported interaction with people who have already mastered the Discourse”. People who thru-hike spend time before the hike to research and prepare for the trail. Most of the information about the trail comes from those who have already hiked it and could be called the mentor. This gives thru-hikers an advantage because unlike what Gee says that “failing to fully display an identity is tantamount to announcing you don’t have that identity” those who have never been on the trail won’t know everything there is about it until they have hiked it all. A hiker is in the apprenticeship stage I believe one doesn’t have to know everything about hiking to be apart of the hiking discourse. Hiking is a secondary discourse that has sub-discourses within it. For example one can be apart of the hiking discourse but may not be apart of the thru-hiking discourse. I believe that one can also mushfake being in the hiking discourse. Gee describes mushfake discourse as “ partial acquisition coupled with meta-knowledge and the strategies to ‘make do’”. If one had the right clothes and gear they could pass as being in the Discourse as long as their knowledge of the discourse wasn’t tested.

Sign Systems/Knowledge

A major part of the hiking Discourse is the knowledge needed to fit in. There are many things one must know before going out on the trail like trail signs and hiking etiquette. For longer hikes knowledge about the trail, wildlife, plants, and climate are crucial to keep safe. Respect is one of the most valued traits of a hiker. Respect of other hikers, of the trail, and of the landscape around you is crucial while hiking. “Leave no trace” is the motto for hikers. We are only there to experience nature not to alter it, so whatever we carry in we, we are supposed to carry out. This connects to the politics of hiking. While one does not have to be a conservationist to fit in most hikers follow that mindset when on the trail. Although this knowledge is important it is only one part of the Discourse. The other part is physical and mental preparedness.

Preparing for a Thru-Hike

When preparing for a multiple day or month hike being mentally and physically ready are critical to being able to complete the hike. Physical fitness determines the miles one is able to complete in a day. This is important because some of the campsites are ten or more miles apart. For thru-hikers it is important to get to a campsite because they have shelters. The less a thru-hiker has to carry usually means better mileage. When thru-hiking, keeping to a schedule is also important. There are certain months that are prime for hiking different trails. These times are when most hikers will attempt to hike because you will encounter the most mild weather. For the AT the best months are between march and may to start. Having the right state of mind starting the hike is key to being able to complete the hike. It will determine how you react to the unexpected on the trail. Many times the weather will change without notice on the trail especially at higher altitudes. Part of being mentally prepared is researching and knowing as much as you can about the trail before going for a hike. This is more important with longer hikes. Although all of these things are important one can be a hiker without having done any research or being that fit.

Transfer between Discourses

The thru-hiking Discourse is more challenging to enter into than the hiking discourse. Although one can transfer almost all aspects of the hiking discourse into the thru-hiking discourse, the thru-hiking discourse is a much more selective. One of the reasons the thru-hiking discourse is difficult to enter is because to be apart of the discourse one must have completed a long-distance trail from end to end. This is difficult to do because of the time commitment that is required. Members within the thru-hiking discourse have different statuses based on the trail(s) hiked, the time it took to complete, and sometimes age.

The three big trails in the U.S. that are known for thru-hiking are the Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail.

These trails are all over 2,000 miles long and take between 3–6 months to complete. All together they are known as the triple crown of hiking. There are few who complete one of these trails, so those who have completed all three are highly respected within the hiking community.

Hiking vs. Thru-Hiking

One can enter the thru-hiking discourse thru different avenues than the widely accepted way. Much of the knowledge about thru-hiking cannot be picked up until one has experienced it. These shared experiences creates a bond among the members of the discourse. People who may know everything about thru-hiking from being told still lacks the firsthand experience and therefore is not apart of the discourse. Some people are able to mushfake their way into the thru-hiking discourse by section hiking. Section hikers as the title suggests hike different sections of a trail usually until they complete the whole trail. Many section hikers set aside a couple of weeks every year to hike. Although they don’t complete the whole trail in one trip they do walk the whole trail and therefore are generally grouped into the thru-hiking discourse. There are also those who will hike the whole trail in one trip but will start somewhere in the middle of the trail. These people are called alternative hikers.

Sign Systems

The Hiking discourse has several sign systems that are widely known within the hiking community. These differ between trails and locations. In the Northeast the AT is marked by white blazes and cairns. The white blaze is only used for the Appalachian trail in the eastern part of the U.S. The amount of blazes and how they are oriented directs hikers to where they need to go next. For example one blaze means to continue straight while two offset blazes can mean turn right or left depending to which side the top blaze is placed.

Conclusion

Hiking is a non-dominant secondary discourse that gives its members the tools to enter into the thru-hiking discourse. Thru-hiking is also a non-dominant secondary discourse that is apart of the hiking discourse. Unlike the hiking discourse, to be apart of the thru-hiking discourse one must have completed a long distance trail. To enter the thru-hiking discourse one must first enter into the hiking discourse. As one becomes fluent in the hiking discourse the more prepared they will be to hike long distance trails, allowing them to more easily acquire the thru-hiking discourse.

Making Learning Easy by Design. How Google’s Primer team approached UX,"How can design make learning feel like less of a chore?

It’s not as easy as it sounds. Flat out, people usually won’t go out of their way to learn something new. Research shows that only 3% of adults in the U.S. spend time learning during their day.¹

Think about that for a second: Despite all the information available at our fingertips, and all the new technologies that emerge seemingly overnight, 97% of people won’t spend any time actively seeking out new knowledge for their own development.

That was the challenge at hand when our team at Google set out to create Primer, a new mobile app that helps people learn digital marketing concepts in 5 minutes or less.

UX was at the heart of this mission. Learning has several barriers to entry: you need to figure out what, where, how you want to learn, and then you need the time, money, and energy to follow through.

This meant our UX needed to serve double duty: The app needed to be inviting and intuitive, and it needed to overcome all the factors that keep people from learning.

To tackle that challenge, we thought about the three main places where users would spend time in our app: the dashboard, the individual lessons, and the activities within each lesson.

1. Dashboard

The dashboard is incredibly important because it’s the first thing people see when they open the app. We iterated and prototyped different dashboards for months. We had lots of ideas: lesson packs, letting users pick from three random lessons, geolocation for events related to the lesson topic, or special widgets about experts and brands we worked with. The possibilities were endless.",https://medium.com/google-design/designing-a-ux-for-learning-ebed4fa0a798,['Sandra Nam'],2015-10-14 17:12:00.761000+00:00,"['Mobile', 'UX', 'Design']"
A new wave of information sharing,"The power of Internet broadcasting is a subject that many have acknowledged but few have actually explored to its full potential. In a fast-paced, ever-changing world — it’s become a standard medium for some of the most prolific voices of our generation, along with some of the most entertaining. Of course it is also a new sort of beast — so rapidly expanding and built by so many hands, thoughts and ideas, that it is impossible to tame and, therefore, sometimes difficult to understand. But within the chaos, we can see certain patterns emerging and ways to create new pathways that allow us to utilise it to our benefit. Through simple applications, and a basic understanding of how to search and curate the content we’re exposed to, we can begin to use this creature to our undeniable advantage.

This is perhaps most evident in the way that we create, find and consume information — making it a perfect tool for broadcasting, a new platform for multimedia to take flight, and with it, the concepts, stories and voices of the global society. Broadcasting online is no longer an elite idea living somewhere in a distant future. It is a very real and immediate avenue, available to anyone who has Internet access and who wants to share their voice with the world.

Of course, the Internet was never meant to take on this role. It started out as a tool for the military and then academics, serving as a kind of network for classified information. However, through its growth and application to every facet of modern society, it has become the perfect place for sharing thoughts and ideas between all of humanity, as opposed to a wasted tool — kept only for select organisations.

The unstoppable momentum of online broadcasting

Radio across the airwaves needed 30 years to reach an audience of 50 million people, TV needed 13 years but the Internet only took 4. So what does this tell us? Simply put, information is no longer being controlled and owned by large, elite groups. Hubs of content have branched out faster than anyone could have imagined, not even 7 years ago, to reach almost every part of the world, right in the offices, studies, bedrooms and local cafes of the Average Joe. While traditional radio would eventually become a phenomenon in most households in the 60s and 70s, it was nowhere near as powerful or big as the reach of the Web is today.

In 1995, seemingly a lifetime but a mere 10 years ago, the first audio was streamed over the Internet. Now audiences of millions listen to podcasts that are created on a daily basis by people who lead normal lives, have other jobs and who have relatable experiences. The difference now is that they also have channels to discuss those experiences with likeminded people.

According to the Internet Census of 2012, the developing world is also jumping on board — gaining greater access to connectivity, and as a result, to new platforms for broadcasting from places that were previously left out of the global discussion. Parts of Africa, such as Botswana and South Africa for example, are growing steadily in the number of users with access to the Net. As a result, we are seeing new faces and voices emerging from these areas, like YouTube user Casper-Lee who has almost 5 million subscribers to his video channel aimed at young adults.

With the growth of online broadcasting comes an almost unfathomable opportunity for new voices to emerge. What will we do with this great new power? Will we harness it and get involved in the conversation or will we leave it to the brave to shape the global discussion? We’re routing for the former.",https://medium.com/speak-louder/broadcasting-online-9bcfcf275477,[],2015-07-14 07:58:35.137000+00:00,"['Broadcasting', 'Tech', 'Internet']"

When Desperation Meets Opportunity Chapter 8 — A #NaNoWriMo 2015 Story,"Chapter 8 — Maggie

“Mommie! Mommie! Wake Up!”

The sounds of an excited boy stir me from my slumber. It is a good thing too — my alarm has been blaring for nearly a half an hour, and I have to be at work in under an hour. Wednesday’s are my long day at the gas station. Twelve hours of work, from nine in the morning until nine at night. Thankfully, since my mom has been helping look after Brayden, it is a lot less stressful trying to figure out how I’m going to take care of him.

What I haven’t figured out yet, however, is what I’m going to do with these ten thousand dollars that I’ve been fortunate enough to receive. Part of me wonders if Mr. Man forgot about me. It has been four days since our last communication. I kind of thought he’d be in touch a lot faster than that. Something I can’t help wondering about is how he was able to find out that I did what he asked so quickly and get me the money as fast. Clearly, he has someone here. Was Rodger in communications with him? It doesn’t seem likely that he’d be the type of company a crazy rich guy like Mr. Man would want around. But, I can’t say I know everything about Rodger. He could have simply been feeding me a line.

“Come on mommie! You have to get up!” Brayden is persistent. I wish he was this reliable of an alarm clock every morning. We’ve certainly have more time to play together.

I sit up in bed and give Brayden a big hug. Then, I get dressed in my work uniform, as you could call it. It really consists of my only pair of brown khaki-ish pants that I own, and a company polo. They only had size medium shirts when I got hired, so some parts of me are much more accentuated than I’d like them to be. Let’s just put it this way — I’ve been offered tips. At a gas station. And I don’t pump any gas.

With time running out, I decide to break my cardinal rule of trying to get Brayden something semi nutritious for breakfast.

“Brayden, we are in a hurry. I’ve got to get you to grandma’s house so I can go to work. Would you like to split a pop-tart with me? Remember, this is a special morning. We won’t do this every day.” His eyes light up, and he starts giggling and running around. You could say he would be very interested in a pop-tart. I open the package and give him one of the two pastries. He takes cute little bits, nibbling around the edges first.

After finished our breakfast, and I use that word lightly, I make sure he is all packed and ready for the day at grandma’s. Even though I’ve had to leave Brayden in the care of someone else multiple times, it still is hard to say goodbye. You want to trust everyone, and hope for the best, but he is still your son and you want to be the one to take care of him all the time. Giving up a piece of that feels like giving up a piece of yourself.

We make it to grandma’s and I give Brayden a warm, long embrace and watch as he disappears into my mom’s house. I’m sure he’ll have a great day. As for me, it is another day and another dollar.

As I pull into the parking lot, I hear a familiar buzzing. It is him. Mr. Man is calling, and I’m almost late for work. Do I dare ignore him? He just paid me ten thousand dollars for something that, admittedly, was challenging, but only took a few hours. I’m about to work twelve hours and might get to take home a hundred and twenty dollars from that. I’m taking the call.

“I was wondering when you might call again” I reply, as if this is somewhat normal now.

“Well that make me feel all warm inside to be thought about!” He laughs. Goosebumps form all over me. “You’ve been such a good girl for me. Rodger, what a sad situation. I bet he’s happy to be out, thanks to you. It is nice to have someone I can trust who is a genuinely good person. That is why it is so hard for me to ask you to do this next task.”

I gulp. This doesn’t sound good. “I’m listening.”

“Good. You might not realize this, but I’m actually from around where you are. Some of the people I’ve associated with actually still live there. One of those people is Dr. Michael Yonowitz. He lives at 732 Sycamore Lane. Do you know him?”

His name sounds vaguely familiar. I feel like I’ve seen buildings that say something like Yonowitz Consulting or Yonowitz Data Services. Definitely somebody who must be important around here.

“Not really, but I think I’ve seen the name.”

“That isn’t too important really. In all actuality, Dr. Yonowitz has some pretty important research that I need. He works for the government and it snooping his nose around where it doesn’t belong. That is where you come in.”

I really don’t like where this headed. The clock on my car shows that I am already 10 minutes late for work. Somehow I have to wrap this up.

“So what do you need me to do?”

“Simple. You need to get into his house and take his personal laptop. Because of the secure nature of his work, he doesn’t connect it to the web. When finished, he uploads to a private server, and…” he stops himself, realizing that I’m probably the worst person to be saying those words to. I don’t have the slightest clue what he’s talking about. “…well, nevermind. That isn’t important. What is on that laptop needs to be destroyed. You need to get his laptop and find a way to dispose of it. You will also need to text me the general area and address of where you destroy it, so my associate can verify you did the job. Then, you’ll get your money.”

How many laws would I be breaking here? This is absolute insanity. I can’t really be considering agreeing with this, can I be?

“You are really asking a lot of me. If you are working with someone here, why can’t they just do this?” I thought this was a reasonable question. He does not.

He snaps back. “How is that ten thousand dollars serving you? Remember, you agreed to do this for me. There is no backing out. Not until what I need done is done. But, if you do decide this is too much for you, I understand. Just be aware that I think Brayden is a wonderful kid. I always thought I’d be a great father, and I sure could use an heir to my company.”

My heart stops for a moment. Not Brayden. Not my boy. What have I brought upon us? “You wouldn’t dare hurt my son!” I scream.

“Who said anything about hurting? I’d make sure anything we did would be completely painless. Don’t forget, if anything happens to him, it is on you. My assumption is you’ll carry out my orders today, and I’m expecting a call by midnight to notify me of your success in this mission. Don’t let me down.” And just like that, I’m alone in my car.

The thought of losing Brayden brings me to tears. My eyes are bursting dams, and I begin sobbing so hard I worry about someone coming to my car. Why did this come to me? Why did I agree? I feel so incredibly stupid right now. I’ve worked so hard for Brayden to make it. Some things are just too good to be true. And now. Now I’m about to become a criminal. With the threat made to my boy, I don’t have a choice.

Even though I’ve been in the parking lot for over a half an hour now. I decide that I’m going to have to call in. That is one benefit of the money — missing work isn’t so painful. I’d much rather go to work than do what I’m about to do. I pull myself out of the parking lot, and after driving back to my apartment, call my boss, making up some lie about Brayden being sick. I’m becoming a worse person by the minute. It is one thing to lie. It is another to wrap Brayden up in it.

Now, I have to think. How exactly does one go about gaining access to someone’s house? I’ve never done this before, if that wasn’t obvious. Plenty of movies show people breaking and sneaking into houses all the time. In several occasions, people wait outside the house until the occupant leaves. That sounds like the best option. I’ve got the entire day open now, so at least time is on my side.

I plug the address into my phone. 15 minutes away. A nice, short little drive. It is actually in the opposite direction from town. Based on the satellite images, it looks like a subdivision, so it won’t be weird for a parked car to be sitting there. I begin my drive.

I haven’t visited this town often. In fact, I rarely, if ever, leave my town. It has everything we need — some fast food restaurants, Wal-mart, and my mom. I’ve never had enough money or time with Brayden to go anywhere. One day, I’m hoping to drive him over to Green Bay to check out Lambeau Field. He loves the Packers’ stuff that I buy him from Goodwill. Thankfully, he is young enough that he isn’t very picky about that. I, myself, am not a huge football fan, but we go watch the games occasionally with my mom and dad, and Brayden really gets into it. One day, I hope I can bring him to where they play.

As I arrive in the general vicinity of my destination, I realize this subdivision is much different than the one my parents live in. First of all, the houses are more spread out. Secondly, the houses are much, much bigger. Some, it appears, are either three stories, or a sprawling complex. Houston, we’ve found the money. Suddenly, I don’t feel so bad taking something from someone here. I’ve been struggling for all of these years while the people up here are living so comfortably. I’m sure they wouldn’t miss anything that I’d take. However, something tells me Dr. Yono-whatever his name is will probably miss the item in my objective.

Here we are. 732 Sycamore Lane. It looks empty right now, but that is hardly scientific. The garage doors, of which there are three, are closed. It is still light out, obviously, so there aren’t any obvious lights. I’m going to need to walk around and inspect the house. If he is gone now. then now is the time to get in there. That would require me to get up to the house and see that it is indeed empty. I’m shaking, but I’ve run through the scenarios in my mind for the last 30 minutes, so I feel like an expert ninja. Naturally, I trip and fall as I exit my car. Great start, ninja.

I walk up the somewhat long driveway and, instead of heading for the front door, skirt around the left side of the house. Thankfully, this house doesn’t appear to have more than two stories. Where the laptop is, who knows. It might not even be in there. What would I do then? I better perish the thought.

The property is well landscaped, with a good variety of plants, shrubs, and trees. It makes it relatively easy to sneak around and not feel too out in the open. It is also around ten in the morning. Most people in a neighborhood this ritzzy are probably off at their jobs making the money it takes to afford to live here. Who knows, if it weren’t for Brayden happening, I might have been on my way to live in one of these. After all, I’d been accepted to the University of Wisconsin — Madison during my senior year. It was going to be perfect too, as my boyfriend was also accepted there. He did get to go there. I’m sure he had fun. But, you can’t live life full of regret. I’d take Brayden over that any day of the week.

I come upon my first window. The blinds are closed, but I try and align my eyes just right to see through the little cracks. It looks dark inside. If anything was moving, I’d probably see it. Time to head around to the back.

Each window, the same story. Mostly dark inside, except for the little of sunlight making its way in. I decide that now is the time. Before I got in, though, I take a few minutes and think about what to say if I get caught. Do I go with the poor, beggar approach. “I’m sorry, I was just so hungry. Your house was open. I wasn’t going to take much. Please, just let me go. I had to leave my child at home to do this.” That could work. Sufficiently sappy enough. They’ll probably just chase me out. Getting caught now is as good as saying goodbye to my son. I can’t afford to fail here.

I make my way back around to the front and try the door. It turns and opens. I’m not sure if this is a break, an omen, or an obvious sign that someone is home. In any case, I am committed. I swing the door open and tip toe inside.

The house itself is very open. There is a stairwell in the direct middle that spirals around and goes to the second floor. Pretty. I bet Brayden would love to try sliding down this thing. To my left appears to be the kitchen and dining room area, and to my right appears to be living space and other rooms. Thankfully, enough light is making its way in that I don’t have to risk turning on any lights. I slowly walk my way into the living area to my right. Some books lay on a table, and there is a desktop computer in this room. But no laptop. I continue onward down a hallway.

It looks like two rooms are on the left, two rooms on the right, and another at the end of the hall. Man this place is huge. I try the first door on my right — it isn’t a room at all — but actually stairs to a basement. Let’s avoid that for now. Too many horror movies end badly when someone is dumb enough to go into the basement. Next is what appears to be a guest bedroom. On my left is a bathroom, and a rather large closet. At the end of the hall is likely the master bedroom. It is gigantic. It might be bigger than my entire apartment. It has been neatly put back together, so however lives here is either very meticulous, or hires a cleaning service. I’m not sure of any around here, but then again, I’m not exactly in the right income bracket for something like that. No laptop in any of these places.

Heading back down the hall, I complete a first floor sweep through the kitchen and dining room. It barely looks like anyone lives here. My apartment is always a mess. This house is immaculate. Enough oohing and aweing — it is time to head upstairs. Off to the left is another pair of rooms across from each other. Both appear to be some kind of study or office combination. One would imagine a laptop being in there. Sure enough, on the desk near the window at the back of the office, is the device I’m looking for. Thank god. I’m not sure how to go about destroying this, but I’ll figure that out. Before I touch it, however, I stop and think about what I’m about to do. When I walked into the house, the door was unlocked. Therefore, I really didn’t break in, and even though I probably shouldn’t have done that, I don’t feel as bad. But, once I pick up this laptop, the second I walk out that door, I am committing a crime. A felony. I’m stealing something extremely valuable, if I’m to believe Mr. Man. This is the point of no return.

What are my alternatives. Do I call the police about the threat to my son? It isn’t like they can keep me under surveillance all day and all night. Besides, what do I tell them. “Oh, hey, you should help me, because some crazy man with a silly made up name is paying me a ton of money to commit crimes for him.” Yeah, that sounds like a completely normal and plausible scenario. Maybe once I make more money doing things for Mr. Man, then I can think about running away. Just grab Brayden and start driving. Somewhere out west. Remote. Some place where he won’t be able to track us down. I shudder to think of what happens next. If this is only my first real task for him, what might the last one look like?

Under my breath, I ask God for forgiveness. I’m not really religious, but if I make it out of this alive, that could change. At that moment, I gather my courage, unplug the laptop, and begin to walk out of the office. It is about that time I hear the front door slam shut. I’m not longer alone in this house.

I freeze. My breath now sounds like an industrial fan. I concentrate as hard as I can to slow it. Around the room, there doesn’t appear to be much cover. Instead of hiding it out here, I take the laptop with me and dart across to the other room. A couch and some other furniture is sitting inside. It looks like I’ll have a place to hide. Before I do that, I hang out in the hallway. I should be able to hear them come up the steps with enough time to hide. If I don’t listen for them, I may miss an opportunity to get out of here. The back of my mind is screaming at me. “It isn’t too late. You can put the laptop back. You can come clean. You can get out of this.” And maybe I can. But this was no longer just about me. The moment he mentioned Brayden, everything about this changed.

I listen closely to footsteps. It sounds like just one person has entered the house. They are walking away from me, so they must be headed to one of the rooms on the far end, where I first investigated. Then, I hear a door open, and then close in the direction that the occupant was walking. Time to make my move. I hold the laptop in one arm, and scurry low along the floor, using my other arm for balance. I get to the spiral staircase, look around. The coast is clear. I quickly make my way down, careful to keep my feet as light as possible. Once I’m at the bottom, I’m ready to make a break for the door. I take one last look. No movement. No noise. I make my way to the door, open it, and step outside.

And find myself face to face with who I presume is Dr. Yonowitz.

“Is that my laptop?!?” He exclaims, incredulously. I freeze. My brain is a lump of jelly at this point. I can’t move. I can’t breath. The man himself isn’t imposing. He is actually only a little taller than me, with a pretty significant bald spot, glasses from the 70s, and a surprisingly modern shirt, tie, and pants combo. “You look scared out of your mind. I’ll make you a deal. Give that back to me, tell me why you have that and I’ll let you go. No need to get the cops involved.”

I’m at the crossroads. On one hand, I could maybe outrun him to my car, and get away. He could always get my license plate and still find me that way. But it is the only clear way to keep my son safe. On the other, I come clean, tell him everything, and maybe he can help me. It then becomes clear to me. Being a mother, there is nothing more important in the world than my son, and being a great mother to my son. What kind of message do I send him, if we make it through this, that breaking the law is the way to making money? If I comply with this madman, I’m not any better than he is. I’m terrified of losing my son, but maybe we can still get away. In fact, I have an idea of where to start.

“Well, young lady, what will it be?” says the doctor. I’m impressed with his patience.

Sheepishly, trembling so much I think I might drop it, I hand the man back his property. A huge weight feels like it has been lifted off my shoulders, only to feel like a bomb goes off inside of me when I know what this could mean. I instantly regret this decision.

“Thank you. I knew you weren’t a bad person. Now tell me, what could you possibly want with this computer?” asks Dr. Yonowitz. It is time to come forward with the truth.

I speak up, quietly. My voice cracks as I push back the tears. “You are Dr. Yonowitz, right?” He nods, looking a little surprised that I knew his name. “Well, I have a long story I think you need to hear. But before I do that, I need to make a phone call. I left my cell phone in the car, do you mind if I use one of yours?”

He responds “Well if that is what you need for us to get to the bottom of this, then I suppose I should let you do that. Please, come back inside. With my permission, this time.”

We head back into the house. His wife, I presume, is making some food in the kitchen, looks genuinely surprised to see me. Hopefully she doesn’t read too much into this. The doctor motions me to the downstairs living area. “Here is a phone you can use. Who might you be calling? I can’t let you just call someone to help you rob me.”

“No, it is nothing like that. You’ll know soon enough. I just need to make sure my son is okay. It is really important that he and my mom come here and listen to what I have to say.”

He nods, as he appears to understand. He then walks over to the kitchen to brief his wife on what exactly is going on.

I pick up the phone and dial my mom’s phone number. Ring. Ring. Ring. Come on mom, answer the call! Finally, I hear a click on the other side.

“Hello, who am I speaking to?”

“Hi mom.”

“Is that you Maggie? Why aren’t you calling from your phone? Are you okay?”

“Actually, mom. I’m not. I need you to get Brayden, and drive over to 732 Sycamore Lane. Please hurry. I’m afraid I’ve done something terribly stupid, and Brayden is in trouble because of me.” She says she is on her way, and hangs up. I’m safe, for now. I’m just praying and hoping that this morning wasn’t the last time I ever get to see my little boy.",https://medium.com/when-desperation-meets-opportunity-a-nanowrimo/when-desperation-meets-opportunity-chapter-8-a-nanowrimo-2015-story-4fe39247a67c,['Josh Gauthier'],2015-11-12 05:43:35.164000+00:00,"['NaNoWriMo', 'Short Story', 'Fiction']"

I should probably explain why that is, but I’ll have to do it in reverse.

First, I want to paint a few different scenes, each placed across a trajectory of time, but overlapping. In one, I’m sitting in a classroom, chairs grouped round in a circle. My dress has blue flowers on it. The professor has scrawled words like “deconstructionism” and “parole” and “langue”on the chalkboard. I have excited questions, and my brain does this thing where it attempts to catalog and categorize the information into pictures or recall other images, like mental post-its arranged around my mind.

In another, I’m 5 years younger and I’m so stoned I’m near paralyzed. My comrades feign intellect while talking Marxist theory, or The Office; but I just spent 20 minutes trying to detangle speaker cables so we can listen to music. I haven’t spoken in what feels like hours, and part of me thinks I’ve forgotten how. The room is haze, and I continue to not speak until a friend almost pours alkyl nitrates (“poppers” for when you get really high) into his eye, having mistaken them for Visine. Somehow, through the smoke, I forced out the words WAIT, NO! loud enough to stop my friend from blinding himself accidentally. I don’t feel particularly good about it though.

It’s 8 months later and I’m standing on the roof of my apartment building. The sky is screaming rain and I scream back at it, because I think the sky is empty. I stare at shards of the ceramic pot I just hurled at center of the rooftop. It used to say “Happy Birthday” and once contained flowers that my parents had ordered for me from 3,000 miles away. At some level, I probably had a feeling then that I wouldn’t graduate college. School was the reason I moved across the country; it was the reason I was working 3 jobs and was flat broke. But that didn’t guarantee I would graduate. 18 months later I would, somewhat involuntarily, drop out.

Then, I’m 4 years older than I was on the roof. I’m standing at the roots of the biggest tree in the world. My partner has handed me two cards in sealed envelopes. In the first, there’s a lot of beautiful words about being on a journey, and Bible passages about the Tree of Life. (Admittedly, I was too excited to read them very carefully at the time.) In the second card, there’s a question, and my fiance is on one knee.

And I’m standing there saying YESYESYES but really I’m saying “Thank the Creator for this moment”.",https://medium.com/scholars-and-friends/luke-ruth-and-redemption-71e052b80f16,['Daunte Cruz'],2015-12-15 08:07:40.640000+00:00,"['Faith', 'Storytelling']"
Remember the Black women who died from police brutality,"About 100 people attended Rekia Boyd’s rally on Wednesday, April 22 in New York City’s Union Square. The number of those in support of the young unarmed Black woman who died at the hands of police officer Dante Servin was much lower compared to those protesting for unarmed black men like Freddie Gray, Michael Brown and Eric Garner. PHOTO BY DERON DALTON

Rekia Boyd, 22, was shot in the back of her head when Dante Servin, an off-duty police officer, shot into a crowd five times on March 22, 2012 in Chicago. She died two days later.

Servin claimed Boyd’s friend Antonio Cross pulled out an object from his pocket and pointed it at him. Servin thought it was a gun, and claimed he feared for his life. The object was a cell phone. Servin was charged with involuntary manslaughter but was found not guilty last month.

There’s been outrage, but only about 100 people attended a rally for Boyd in New York City’s Union Square on April 22, according to For Harriet.

According to social justice organizers, Black women as both leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement and victims of police violence don’t get enough support. They receive little of the media coverage that is often centered around black men.

Janisha Gabriel, 34, website designer of blacklivesmatter.com, didn’t expect thousands of people to turn out. “I would say the crowd was very responsive and very receptive. And I was very moved by the poetry that was shared and by the words that were shared.” PHOTO BY DERON DALTON

Janisha Gabriel, 34, website designer of blacklivesmatter.com, helped organize the rally for Boyd with Black Lives Matter: NYC. She expected a small turnout. She said larger white-run liberal organizations respond mainly to the deaths of Black men, due to social media campaigns and news coverage in recent years.

Gabriel’s goal is to grow public resistance around the deaths of Black women. She plans to launch a database in July, speakmyname.org, which will be a collection of Black (non-trans and trans) women and girls who were victims of state, domestic and police violence. Thus far, she has about 700 names.

Timeline: Black Woman And Girl Victims Of Police Violence Since 2008:

And while she was glad to see people come out in support of Boyd, black men in particular, she would like to see a lot more.

“I was happy to see the Black men that were there,” Gabriel said. “But ultimately we need for a lot of Black men to be present in these moments.

When domestic violence is one of our leading causes of deaths and Black trans women have a life expectancy of 35 years of age, we need Black men to be very present with us to have some deep conversations.”

According to Gabriel, these conversations can’t take place because there’s an issue with media response. She said Black women and girls as victims of violence don’t make national news.

“Media has responded to Black deaths specifically because of the social media campaigns around Trayvon Martin,” Gabriel said. She calls the deaths of Black men a popular topic and said people are interested in seeing Black men as threatening.

“Black men’s deaths [are] associated with the concept of Black men being inherently violent, which is why people are always justifying the deaths of Black men. The media plays into that.” Gabriel wants to change the narratives to include all Black people.

Instavideo Q&As On Challenges Black Women Face As Victims Of Police Violence:

“Until we as men are willing to bring out these stories and be just as enraged by the deaths of our women as much as we are of our men in our communities, then it’s going to continue to be the same silence around it,” said Luke “Aidge” Patterson, 35, coordinator of People’s Justice. “But I do think that people are beginning to see what is going on with women.” PHOTO BY DERON DALTON

Luke “Aidge” Patterson, 35, coordinator of People’s Justice, an organization focused on police accountability, said it has taken a long time for even the deaths of Black men to be recognized.

“It’s only been recently the news has been covering these cases that happen and it’s only because people have been rising up in mass numbers,” Patterson said. “When are we in our own communities going to hold up our sisters to be just as important as our brothers?”

Patterson said even though Black men face oppression, with the privilege men hold in society, the lives of women continue to be devalued.

“It is very real that Black men are under attack in this country, but recognizing the role of that patriarchy and that male-dominated society — it really shows within how we do undervalue the lives of women,” Patterson said.

Andrea Ritchie, 46, Soros Justice Fellow at Streetwise and Safe, an organization focused on sharing the ins and outs of encountering police as LGBTQ youth of color, said Black women are expected to play the roles of the mother, partner and sister of Black male victims of police brutality.

“Black women are saying that not only do we play those roles, we are also directly targeted by police for the same kinds of racial profiling, police brutality, and police killings,” Ritchie said. She added that sexual assault is the second most reported form of police abuse after excessive force, according to a 2010 Cato Institute study.

“Black women are starting to say, ‘No! It’s time we start standing up for all members of our communities and we need people to stand up for us the way we stand up for them,’” Ritchie said.

“God bless Rekia. Her life matters, but so do all these other women who are trans. Their lives also matter,” said Ashley Love, 35, coordinator of Black Trans Women’s Lives Matter. “So next time invite five friends, invite 10 friends. We got to put the pressure on.” PHOTO BY DERON DALTON

Ashley Love, 35, coordinator of Black Trans Women’s Lives Matter, shared some words at Boyd’s rally last month.

“Black women have been the strongest organizers since slavery and Jim Crow,” Love said. “And these are our sons, our brothers and our fathers that are being murdered, but when we need help sometimes I feel that they aren’t there. I was born with a medical condition. I am trans. But I don’t always feel comfortable disclosing that in some of these spaces because then I feel like the warmth goes to coldness. And it’s like, ‘Just be a cute little cheerleader and be there for the cause, but don’t talk about all that other stuff. It’s radical.’ All of our lives matter. Segregation was wrong for Black people, segregation is also wrong for transsexual people. We are not second-class women. We shouldn’t have to use separate restrooms and drink from separate drinking fountains, but that’s what’s going on right now.”

Love said Black transsexual and transgender women should be supported as well as all Black women. According to Ritchie, Black Lives Matter co-founders Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi are game changers because they’re hoping to make Black women and trans people the center of the movement.

“Women aren’t often seen as leaders,” said Garza, 34. “That’s always a challenge, dealing with patriarchy. We just get ‘invisibilized’… and not just Patrisse, Opal and myself. This is largely women-led, largely queer-led and trans-led.”

Arielle Newton, 23, the editor-in-chief and founder of blackmillennials.com, said attention to the most oppressed is growing.

“Women, in particular, have been on the forefront. I feel like we have been uplifted within the movement,” Newton said. “Now can more be done? Absolutely.”

According to Ritchie, Black women victims of police brutality and misconduct are receiving attention, but not enough. Thursday, May 21, there will be a national call of action for Black women and girls to end state violence against them and remember the victims. Hopefully many more people will come out and speak up for them.

Right-Braining in a Text-Brained World,"For as long as I can remember, I’ve told stories through pictures. I love the process of capturing life’s special moments as they unfold, and the opportunity it presents to bring people together through otherwise ephemeral moments in time. I built J. Garner Studios with other creatives who share this vision, each of whom delight in capturing the moments that are most “real” and often spontaneous.

As a team of professional photographers, the way we work and the creativity of what we produce are intrinsically linked. We’re constantly on the move — scoping sites, at photo shoots, back in the office editing or sharing our work with clients. Communicating and getting things done together, while apart and on-the-go, is an essential aspect of the way we work.

Before discovering Talko, we relied on text-centric tools. We’d text, email, send a picture, have a quick phone call. The conversation would then continue back in email or text. It was all so “left-brained”. There was no flow to the way we did all of this. It was time-consuming and tedious. No tool or person had a holistic view of what was going on. As inherently visual thinkers, it constrained our ability to communicate effectively across the team. We’d often find that we couldn’t get on the same page or make decisions until we were all back in the office.

Talko has delivered a much more sensory, tactile way for my team to communicate. We use it for everyday communications and for scenarios that are unique to our work, such as “social storyboarding” from a potential shoot location. Those of us on site can describe and show what we’re thinking for the shoot in real-time, from the site location, in ways that we simply could never do with text-centric tools. I can easily and quickly send a stream of photos, while describing what I’m seeing without any disruption to the flow of what I’m saying. Others can easily chime in, ask questions, express opinions, or merely make a quick comment using text if they don’t want to disrupt what I or someone else is saying.

And while real-time is compelling, Talko also reduces disruptions. If I’m in the middle of a photo shoot at the moment when others are communicating about the next big project, I’m able to retain my focus on the job at-hand because I know that everything is captured for me to review and reply later, on my own time.

It’s remarkable how much this App has accelerated our creative process. My mind’s not bogged down by the tedium of how we communicated previously. Everything just flows in a natural way that allows the creative ideas to remain at the forefront. Talko allows us to create together and make quick decisions like never before.

My entire team has felt the benefits. Our communications are streamlined and richer. Whereas the time and intention it takes to draft and send a text or email can easily kill a creative thought, the multi-sensory nature of Talko brings that creative thought to life. When doing something like “social storyboarding”, we’re able to quickly capture the idea in words that naturally flow, and we can layer in some context with photos at just the right moment. It’s magical, and it’s never been possible previously. It’s an honest, sensory, transparent, fast and effective (not to mention fun) way to communicate and work as a team.

So yes, Talko feels better, but it also saves us time and money. For example, we were recently working on the imagery for a website where we needed to shoot within a building. Instead of venturing out to the site multiple times at different times to capture lighting and scope specific shoot locations, the client was able to talk (and show) me through it all on Talko. I wasn’t pulled away from other projects or forced to bill travel time, and we were able to get the scope done much more quickly. Simple, priceless.

I now find myself living in Talko, and not just for work — I use it with my landscaper, and I use it with my buddies to plan fishing trips. Now that I’ve found something that simply feels more attuned to my nature, everything else just feels… archaic. I can’t imagine going back.

Old Labour and young Labour both agree their time has come with Jeremy Corbyn,"Old Labour and young Labour both agree their time has come with Jeremy Corbyn

The Mirror’s Brian Reade goes on the leadership trail with Jeremy Corbyn to find out why the crowds are flocking to see him.

The queue snaked for 100 yards along the pavement outside the Tyne Theatre in the lashing rain an hour before he arrived.

In a square around the corner, 500 more, unable to get their hands on one of the 1,280 tickets that sold out in five hours, braved the miserable Newcastle night for an open air pre-rally, rally, waiting with rapt anticipation to hear their bearded, peace-loving messiah called JC spread his anti-austerity gospel.

When he finally arrives, 45 minutes late, due to the 1,000 supporters who had delayed him at an afternoon meeting in Middlesbrough, the crowd greet him with raucous cheers and his Obama-esque mission statement: “Jes we can, Jez we can.”

He takes to the outdoor stage with a grace that defies his 66 years. Dressed in his trademark lecturer chic he is a paragon of cool.

And he’s straight into his message: “People want to know how we can make society different and how can we make our party more in touch with ordinary people’s lives? People are crying out for an alternative that should have been put at the last election.”

Each sentence is punctuated with loud roars from the wet, but fixated crowd.

Yet it’s not just the huge, unprecedented numbers of people who are turning up for these Corbyn rallies that should frighten the Labour Party hierarchy, it’s the type of people.

Yes there are characters from hard-left central casting handing out pamphlets, and plenty of old school trade unionists and socialists (some sporting Jezza caps), even veteran film-maker Ken Loach.

But the crowd is more reminiscent of a student union gig than a collection of dinosaurs of yesteryear.

They’re mostly youthful, mostly disillusioned, traditional Labour voters. They’re Old Labour and Young Labour but they want a new Labour. Corbyn is energising them. And giving them hope.

People like retired teacher, Eric Scarboro, 59, who said he became disillusioned under Tony Blair and drifted away from the party.

But Corbyn has pulled him back with his anti-austerity message and his sincerity. “There’s no performance going on. He’s real,” he says.

And the criticism of those who’ve been won over by Corbyn, makes him even more determined to see his man win: “The Labour Party wanted to win back the disillusioned and those who’ve never voted. Then when we come to them, they tell us to go away.”

Inside the Tyne Theatre, I put it to a 43-year-old electrician Rod, that their messiah surely has no chance of winning the next general election on a far-left agenda, meaning at least 10 years of Tory rule.

“Do you really believe any of the other Tory-lite candidates can win?” he replies. “And if they did, on what platform? All three of them have already refused to oppose Osborne’s savage welfare cuts. So what’s their point?”

His friend, Mike, butts in: “I’m tired of compromise that’s brought us nothing. If you’re going to lose, lose on your own terms.

“What did that Mexican fella say? It’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.”

It could almost be the Corbyn slogan.

Jeremy Corbyn with Brian Reade in Newcastle /Daily Mirror

Inside the hall it feels like I’m back in Scotland during last year’s referendum. There is an electric buzz in the air. A sense of liberation.

When Corbyn speaks he touches their every G-spot: Bankers’ greed, welfare cuts, the NHS, anti trade union laws, the consequences of our illegal wars.

He tells them “the levels of inequality in this country are the worst in Europe. Surely we can do something very different?”

He says he wants to see a “fundamental change to our politics” centred on “a basic humanity.”

He tells them that their “optimism” this summer “has produced a big change in how we do politics.”

When he finishes, all 1,280 supporters leap to their feet roaring their lungs out, yelling for more.

When I take a straw poll of why they are transfixed by a pension-aged backbencher who has spent most of his time in Westminster opposing his party the same words come back. Because he’s “authentic, real, a breath of fresh air, decent, straight, principled, genuine.”

Jeremy Corbyn addresses the Middlesbrough afternoon meeting

He has been packing out 1,000-plus auditoria across the land for weeks. They’ve had to move rallies to bigger venues and set up overspill rooms.

His own Twitter account following now stands at 104, 000. It was below 32,000 when the campaign begin.

This is a phenomenon, the like of which I haven’t seen in 40 years of watching Labour from close-quarters.

Because it’s feeding off an aching for change that’s coming from ordinary Labour supporters below, not being imposed by rulers from above.

Corbyn stands behind the slogan: “Straight talking. Honest politics.”

He’s using the words a man in the pub uses, the way Nigel Farage did so effectively. It’s unspun, unaffected and unapologetic.

Whatever happens in this leadership election there is a feeling that the Labour party won’t be the same again. This most astonishing of campaigns has changed the party for good.

And it’s no bad thing. Many among the left feel they have been taken for granted and told to bite their tongue for too long.

Told that due to the electoral system it’s no longer about what they want and believe in, but what swing voters in middle England want, and what their focus groups tell the Labour Party to currently believe in.

Too many traditional Labour supporters believe the party has become obsessed with how it is perceived rather than what it stands for.

That rather than put local activists up for election, they choose to parachute Oxbridge-educated advisers into safe seats to give them a route to a future cabinet.

Blame the old Blairites like Tony himself or Peter Mandelson, comfortably living on the millions they made off the back of being voted in by working-class Labour voters, who now have the gall to tell anyone who warms to Corbyn that they need a heart transplant.

They have been his finest recruitment officers.

It may not end wonderfully for the Corbyn camp. Politics is a brutal business. But right now they’re having their say. Their legitimate, democratic say. Under Labour Party rules.

Across the land at these rallies Old Labour and Young Labour are living in the moment.

They feel their time has come.

Impacting Business As-It-Happens,"To get value out of today’s big and fast data, organizations must evolve beyond traditional analytic cycles that are heavy with data transformation and schema management. The Hadoop revolution is about merging business analytics and production operations to create the ‘as-it-happens’ business. It’s not a matter of running a few queries to gain insight to make the next business decision, but to change the organization’s fundamental metabolic rate. It is essential to take a data-centric approach for infrastructure to provide flexible, real-time data access, collapsing data silos and automating data-to-action for immediate operational benefits.

Lesson #1 — Journey to the Real-Time Data-Centric Enterprise

There are two types of companies in the big data space. Those that are born in big data to deliver a competitive edge through the software or the processes for enabling big data and then there are the rest. Those who have a mandate to simultaneously cut IT and storage costs, and to create a platform for innovation.

There are a few MapR customers I want to highlight as they have been very successful on their journey to become Real-Time Data-Centric Enterprises and are great examples that this is real and completely possible.

Urban Airship sends over 180B text messages per month. Some of their users are sports fans who require information as-it-happens, and waiting for hours is not good enough. They deliver actionable information so that brands like Starbucks can ensure the best experience possible for their customers.

Rubicon Project created pioneering technology that created a new model for the advertising industry–similar to what NASDAQ did for stock trading. Rubicon Project’s automated advertising platform processes over 100B ad auctions each day and provides the most extensive reach in the industry, touching 96% of internet users in the US.

Machine Zone, creators of Game of War, had their operations isolated from analytics and their ability to deliver actionable data was limited. They reengineered their platform to deliver operations and analytics on the same platform and now support over 40M users and more than 300k events per second.

If you would like to read about more use cases for creating an as-it-happens business I recommend reading this new and freely downloadable O’Reilly book Real-World Hadoop written by Ted Dunning and Ellen Friedman.

Lesson #2 — Replatforming the Enterprise

Real-time doesn’t require just big or just fast–or big in one cluster and fast in another. It requires big and fast together, working harmoniously. What we should be thinking about now is whether or not there is an overall architectural approach to bring the two together that can be followed to ensure success.

To answer this question we should step back and understand where we have been and where we are going. Applications have dictated the data format, but now we can see that the data should freely support varied compute engines. ETL is a very heavy complicated process that often takes an extensive amount of time and resources, thus we would be better served by handling fast growing data sources with a load and go philosophy. Finally, where there has been a tremendous amount of latency in systems, we must continually figure out how to remove the latency.

With this new architectural approach, we need to consider all of the hardware we have in our data centers. Not just the hardware set aside for Hadoop, but everything. We need to build on top of all the hardware and change our way of thinking. We need to get away from static partitioning of hardware and onto a more dynamic approach. On top of all the hardware we need to be able to manage all resources globally; we must be able to elastically expand and contract resources on-demand. An example of this would be a hybrid approach by using Project Myriad to allow Apache Mesos to manage YARN. 451 Research wrote a research brief about MapR co-launching the Myriad project to unite Apache YARN with Apache Mesos.

On top of global resource management we need a set of cohesive data storage services which any application can use, including: a distributed file system that can deliver against all of our business continuity needs, real-time storage and processing. To enable the most value on this new architectural approach MapR announced as part of the 4.1 release that there will be two new pieces of functionality added for MapR-DB:

First is the Multi-Master Replication between clusters. This means you will now be able to deploy multiple active (read/write) clusters across globally distributed data centers so that you may place live data closer to end users. MapR-DB will maintain global consistency via synchronous or asynchronous (when the network can’t handle synchronous) replication. This will minimize data loss (in the case of data center failure) with transaction-level replication.

Second is the new C API for MapR-DB, which lets you write native C/C++ applications for MapR-DB. Additionally, you can leverage this C API from more than 20 different languages by utilizing a framework like SWIG.

Finally, in order to complete the replatforming we need the distributed applications that drive our businesses to play nicely with these enabling technologies. With MapR any application that can read/write to an NFS mount is already capable of plugging directly into this architecture.

Lesson 3 — Data Agility

The real-time data-centric enterprise is not really driven by the data-to-insight cycle; it is really driven by the data-to-action cycle. Insights are great, but being able to take action on the information makes all the difference in an as-it-happens business.

If we want to have operations and analytics on the same platform, we need to think about how we get data in and how we handle it at scale to deliver real-time and actionable analytics. We must think about managing, processing, exploring and leveraging the data. In order to shorten the data-to-action cycle we have to remove steps in legacy processes to move forward. We no longer want to create and maintain schemas, or to transform or copy data. These processes take time and they don’t deliver value in a data-to-action cycle. What we want moving forward is low latency, scalability and integration with ubiquitous technologies like SQL and the BI tools already in use.

This is where Apache Drill comes in. This is a SQL query engine that supports self-service data exploration without the need to predefine a schema. Drill is ANSI SQL 2003 compliant and plugs right into all of those BI tools you are accustomed to using in an industry standard way. With Drill you simply query your data in place; there is no need to perform ETL or to move your data. After all, if you currently use business intelligence tools, you should be enabled to still use them.

Lesson 4 — Good Enough?

“Good enough” won’t be once your business users start experiencing the value of real-time big data. They will only want more and faster. No matter what use case you start with for your journey, your journey will require real-time and enterprise-grade.

It is paramount to remember that an as-it-happens business is as much about business process reinvention as it is about the technology that runs the business. Keep in mind that doesn’t mean replacing all the tools you use in your business. It means rethinking how you operate and augment your tools where necessary to impact your business as-it-happens.",https://medium.com/the-ramp/impacting-business-as-it-happens-8bdb367c3fd0,['Jim Scott'],2015-12-07 14:42:26.239000+00:00,"['Big Data', 'Data Science', 'Hadoop']"
Music Consumption on Mobile,"In our last blog post, we discussed some of the reasons why people are churning on music services. We also talked about how added choice for consumers impacts retention.

In this post, we’re going to cover music consumption patterns on mobile. We’re going to talk about the good, the bad and a less ugly future for the mobile music ecosystem. We’re also going to make some suggestions based on the following observations:-

Mobile is Still the Wild West — there are 2.6 billion annual smartphone subscriptions and over one million apps in both the App Store and Play Store. Retention is a tough nut to crack given the amount of competition. This is just as true for music apps as it is for any other mobile consumer offering. Mobile Music Consumption Patterns and the App Graph — we look at consumption patterns on mobile and how the app graph is a good proxy for the fragmentation of mobile music services. On-boarding and Customer Success Tips — given the issues identified around retention on mobile, we discuss what steps can be taken to increase customer success. We also discuss some new technology that we’ve developed called ‘Shine’ which helps profile a user’s given music persona on mobile.

“It is not the employer who pays the wages. Employers only handle the money. It is the customer who pays the wages” — Henry Ford

Mobile is Still the Wild West

It’s no secret that on mobile, getting and keeping users is really hard. The talented team at Quettra have released some fascinating insights into what the average retention rates are across Android. As Andrew Chen, advisor to Quettra discusses, the key to success is getting users hooked during the first 3–7 day period.

Image courtesy of Pablo, quote by @andrewchen

To put that in context, the average cost per install (CPI) for mobile advertising on Facebook is currently just over $4.00. So let’s take ABC Streaming Ltd which is looking to increase its user-base in a new territory and is willing to pay Facebook for this privilege. A campaign of 10,000 installs wouldn’t be unrealistic to test what the uptake might be like in that location. Let’s say that ABC Streaming Ltd spends $40,000 on the acquisition of these 10,000 users. One month later, they’ll be lucky to have about 1000 users actively using the service. Three months later, that figure will drop to 500 active users.

Now this is slightly oversimplified as not all users are mobile first. ABC Streaming Ltd could also use free trials and other incentives to keep people engaged. Still this example gives a general indication of how expensive it is to get and keep users on mobile. $40,000 for 500 users. That’s an eye watering $80 acquisition cost per active user (before any licensing costs or other operational costs needed to support that user).

The reality is that it makes very little business sense for the majority of app developers to spend marketing dollars on paid acquisition. If mobile is the wild west, the cost of excavating that gold is only increasing as the land grab continues.

Mobile Music Consumption Patterns

The ease of access to content is accompanied by an ever increasing number of options for the music consumer. As Next Big Sound reported recently on their first six months of data in 2015, services like SoundCloud have seen nearly 100% growth year-on-year between May 2014 and June 2015. With this growth in digital consumption comes further fragmentation. This means a bigger pie made up of more slices.

To illustrate, we have highlighted the top 7 mobile music services tracked on our app when it was featured in the Google Play Store earlier in the year. Soundwave allows people to track the music that they’re listening to on mobile so we’re well placed to provide some analysis on this.

What surprised us was that a whopping 71% of listeners during week 1 and 68% during week 2 listened to music natively* on their mobile devices. Spotify came in second making up 14% of plays in week 1 and 17% of plays in week 2. YouTube made up 10% of the plays captured during this period. The sample size is not insignificant over the two weeks (1.6m and 2.1m plays tracked by our app).

*Native music plays means song plays of mp3 files stored locally on the device and played through the pre-installed or native music app on the phone.

Breakdown of mobile sources for songs tracked on Soundwave for week 1 of the feature

These figures might be skewed towards Android given it was a Google Play feature. Also, these listenership statistics predate the release of Apple Music and there was a bug with SoundCloud tracking over that period so these service haven’t been accounted for. Nonetheless, this study shows a lot of native consumption. These users have been referred to as the ‘Passive Majority’ by our advisor Mark Mulligan who reckons that 47% of consumers fit into this category. Our data would seem to backup this analysis. As Mark points out:

“But the for all the evolution, today’s digital music marketplace is an unbalanced one. We have more than 500 music services across the globe but too many of them are chasing after the same customers with weakly differentiated offerings. This wouldn’t matter so much is if the competition was focused on where the consumer scale is, but this is anything but the case.”

Breakdown of mobile sources for songs tracked on Soundwave for week 2 of the feature

The key takeaway for us is that native music consumption on mobile is far from dead. This has been a blind spot for the industry as it’s difficult to track globally. For our user-base anyway, it’s clear that there’s a large percentage of users who still consume most of their music natively on the device and not through streaming services.

This is also supported by our previous qualitative research into Teenage Mobile Behaviours around Music. During this research we found that the majority of cash starved teenagers were more likely to use native MP3s or free music consumption alternatives (such as illegal YouTube wrapper apps) to consume music on mobile.

Despite this current landscape, the ‘Passive Majority’ represent the biggest opportunity for streaming services. As mentioned in the last post, it’s much harder to ‘win-back’ new subscribers who are already using an existing streaming service than it is to convert first time streamers into loyal and sticky users.

The App Graph

Our VP of Engineering, Dave Lynch, and I spent some time analysing the app graph to see how this fragmentation correlates in terms of music apps installed on the mobile device. By app graph, we mean that we’ve used our consumer app Soundwave, to look at what other music apps have been installed on our user’s devices. We do this on an anonymised aggregated basis.

We removed YouTube from the study because it’s preinstalled on the majority of Android devices. Google Play Music does come bundled with some devices but not to the same extent. The sample size analysed was just over 7,000 devices.

Looking at all the major music streaming services, we found that the mean number of music apps installed was 2.5. Where at least 1 app exists, the mean number of music apps installed increased to 3. That’s quite a lot of choice for the average mobile music consumer. Just under 10% of the devices had 5 or more music apps installed.",https://medium.com/soundwave-stories/music-consumption-on-mobile-3d60be13e607,['Craig Watson'],2015-10-19 22:16:24.401000+00:00,"['Mobile', 'Music', 'Analytics']"

American Horror Story: The Cecil Hotel,"Judging by her blog, her Tumblrs, and her Instagram, Elisa Lam was smart and funny, often sarcastic, and interested in many of the things that attract other intelligent, curious women her age — literature, architecture, photography, and especially fashion. Like so many of us, Elisa’s problems seemed to mostly lie within, and she wasn’t afraid to say as much online, for whoever happened to find her there. Her Tumblr, which she called Nouvelle/Nouveau, alternates between light and dark, between anger and optimism, between heavy quotes about loneliness and identity and things chosen (I assume) because she found them funny.

It is pointless to draw any assumptions about a person from the images she grabbed from other websites and collaged on a page, but it felt good to be laughing at things that Elisa selected precisely because they were funny.

This person, viewed through a very tiny virtual window that features only a few lines of her own writing, and no pictures of her own, was somehow more alive and three-dimensional than any version of Elisa Lam I’d found so far.

Until the fall of 2012, when she noted that she was “much more active on tumblr,” Elisa kept another blog which, though infrequently updated, seems like an honest and raw account of her feelings: Frustration, disappointment, confusion, and a fair amount of self-loathing. Elisa felt that she ate poorly and didn’t exercise enough. She considered herself lazy and was worried about what she’d do with her life. In other words, she felt the kinds of things we all feel at 21. But Elisa had bigger, realer issues, too.

Depression haunted her, and it seemed to flare up in 2012, causing her to miss classes again. In three years, Elisa writes, she completed only three courses and was officially still a first-year student. Meanwhile, her peers were moving on, and that reality cast her further adrift. She slept during the day and was up at night, online, reading about fashion and posting to social media, where there’s always someone to talk to.

Her penultimate post, written on April 4, 2012, is titled “Worries of a twenty something” and is particularly painful to read in retrospect.

I spent about two days in bed hating myself. Why don’t I simply do the things that I know will make me feel better? It isn’t rocket science. It isn’t that difficult. Get out of bed. Eat. See people. Talk to people. Exercise. Write. Read.

The post from there is no less self-excoriating, a public airing of the qualities Elisa most hates in herself that finishes with these lines: “The only thing that does make you different is that you’re a complete utter failure and have depression so la dee da that makes you special. Why aren’t so proud of that? Oh it’s special because people can pity you and you can manipulate them with their pity and use them to just weedle (sic) out more time. But you don’t do anything. God I hate you so much.”

That last line stopped me.

It was the point at which my exploration into Elisa’s online persona in search of her actual person ceased to feel like journalism and started to feel like voyeurism. Without access to any humans who’d known her, I was fishing around in collections of her thoughts, many of them dashed off in her most vulnerable moments. I felt a little sick.

That was when I noticed that the post had 48 comments. It seemed like a lot for a student’s blog. I clicked.

The first was left by a concerned reader, offering help, written 10 weeks after the post itself. But the next 47 were all written after her death, and the first one — posted March 1, 2013 at 2:52am—restored my belief that chasing Elisa’s Internet ghost was a worthy exercise, after all.

Here’s that post, in full:",https://medium.com/matter/haunted-947d642a6d59,['Josh Dean'],2015-11-06 22:13:53.894000+00:00,"['Conspiracy Theory', 'Big Stories Matter', 'Internet']"
The Lasting Sadness Of Donnie Baseball,"“The most striking aspect of Don Mattingly’s career, from one point of view, is the number of years that he produced mediocre statistics,” Murray Chass of The New York Times wrote after Mattingly retired and the Yankees unveiled his plaque in the famous Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. His career was divided in half: six years of domination, followed by six years of frustration and unfulfilled expectations.

He had the misfortune to play for the Yankees during one of the rare epochs when they weren’t a playoff dynasty. He was drafted in 1979, a year after they won the World Series, and made his debut in 1982, a year after the Yankees lost the Series to the Dodgers. He played in the postseason just once in his career — 1995, his final season. The Yankees lost in the division series to the Seattle Mariners, ending on Edgar Martinez’s dramatic double in the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 5, as Ken Griffey Jr. slid into home. For his part, Mattingly hit .417 with a home run, four doubles, and six RBIs, but he’d never collect the World Series ring that seemed to be a birthright for every player in pinstripes.

The Yankees finally won the World Series again in 1996, while Mattingly was taking a self-imposed year off from baseball. He had left open the possibility of playing again someday, but after watching his old teammates win the championship while his replacement, Tino Martinez, drove in over 100 runs — something Mattingly hadn’t done since 1989 — too much had changed. “Once they had gone to the Series without us, there was no coming back,” his wife, Kim, said. He officially retired three months later.

Mattingly could not have foreseen that disappointment when he was a hot high school prospect in Evansville, though. He hit over .500 in his junior and senior years for Reitz Memorial, leading his team to a 59–1 record from 1978 to 1979. The Tigers won the Indiana state championship in 1978 with a perfect 30–0 record, and lost in extra innings in the championship game the next year, their only defeat of the season.

Besides the sweet swing and smooth glove that attracted the big league scouts, he had that certain work ethic that separates the best players from the rest. “It wasn’t just that he was the best player, he was the hardest worker,” said Quentin Merkel, his high school coach. “He was so driven — I’ve never had a player who could hit like him.” He was drafted that summer in the 19th round, going so low because teams were concerned about his lack of speed, and were convinced he wanted to go to college. But he signed with the Yankees and climbed quickly through their minor league system, making one stop at each level until his New York debut in 1982. He played part of the next season in AAA, then stuck with the Yankees full-time.

Early in the 1984 season, when Daryl Strawberry was capturing New York’s baseball attention for the Mets in Queens, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner made a famous prediction. “You can talk all you want about Strawberry,” he said. “I’ll take Mattingly. He’s the best young talent in baseball today … He’ll be the batting champion in three years.”

Steinbrenner was wrong about one thing: the amount of time it would take Mattingly to reach the top. He won the batting crown that season, hitting .343 to go with 23 home runs and 110 RBI, edging out teammate Dave Winfield by going 4–for-5 on the last day of the season.

The next year was Mattingly’s monster MVP season, and by then, the legend was born. In a 1986 New York Times poll, Mattingly’s peers voted him the best player in the game. Kansas City Hall of Famer George Brett, who knew a thing or two about good hitting himself, said of Mattingly, “If he isn’t the best, I’d like to know who is.”

Over the first six years of his career, he averaged .327, hit 27 homers with 114 RBI, collected five Gold Gloves, and was an All-Star each season, numbers that would put him among the elite today, even by current performance-enhanced standards. But in the first part of the 1990 season, he struggled at the plate, suffering from a back injury. He went on the disabled list for most of the season, and finished at .256, his worst season as a pro.

Mattingly He returned to full-time duty the next season and was able to hit for average, but the power was gone; over his final five years, he averaged just 11 home runs and 68 RBI. That crucial pivot through the lower back and torso that allows a hitter generate power from his legs, directing his full body weight through a swing, was no longer there. By 1995, the always vocal Yankee fans, while outwardly continuing to adore Mattingly, started to whisper that it might be time to ease him out the door.

The end didn’t come quickly, however.

After that final night in Seattle, Mattingly didn’t officially retire, but he didn’t necessarily promise to come back either. “As far as I’m concerned, I will not play this year at all,” he said on a conference call during spring training in 1996. “Unless something really weird happens. You never say never, but I don’t have any intentions of playing this year or coming back halfway or doing anything like that.” The Yankees left the door open for him, but he said he needed to spend time at home with his family. “I knew I didn’t want to play. I’ve always been very selfish about baseball. I’ve been able to do that and block everything else out. At this point, I didn’t want to block everything else. I wanted to be able to hang out with the kids. I wanted to be home. It’s really as simple as that,” he said.

Mattingly spent the 1996 season on the family ranch near Evansville he calls Diamond 5, tending to the horses and spending time with Kim and their three sons, Taylor, Preston, and Jordon. He turned down an offer to play for the Baltimore Orioles that summer, and watched as the Yankees went to the playoffs and beat Atlanta in the World Series. Kim later told The New York Times that Don watched the final game on TV with the boys, but turned it off after the final out, before the celebrations started.

He officially retired on January 22, 1997, at a press conference at Yankee Stadium. “I wasn’t willing to pay the price it was going to take to be able to succeed,” he said, again citing his family and the back problems as his reasons for retiring. “At that point, I knew it was time to step away.” Steinbrenner, effusive again, 13 years after predicting Mattingly would win a batting title, said, “I don’t believe any player on the New York Yankees was ever as great as Don Mattingly in every way during my years as an owner. He was a great athlete and a great player. Some great athletes are not great human beings and vice versa. This man combined all of that.”

Regarding the pain of watching his old teammates finally win a World Series without him, Mattingly said, “I wasn’t cheated because I chose the road. Very honestly, I would do it again. Even if I knew they were going to win. I know I did the right thing.” He was diplomatic that day, acknowledging that the previous fall was painful, but expressing happiness for the team. But that stoicism was perhaps just another example of the trademark humility that made him such a popular player. Kim later hinted that the experience was much more painful than he let on, that it didn’t all end the way they had hoped. “It seemed like baseball just ended in Seattle [after the 1995 playoffs] for us,” she said. ”There just didn’t seem to be any closure. I wanted a storybook ending.”",https://the-cauldron.com/the-tragedy-of-donnie-baseball-3f3b18a5b0ca,['Matt Wood'],2015-10-21 20:55:52.832000+00:00,"['Sports', 'New York Yankees', 'Baseball']"

Observations

Company observations

Consumer

Nest vs. SmartThings — In the long run is it better to have one dominant product and build a platform around that (Nest), or build the platform first and the devices around that platform (SmartThings/Samsung)? Hue/Smart Lights — Smart light bulbs receive a much higher margin vs. traditional LED Bulbs. The Hue bulbs sell for $60 each. Mistfit and Withings — Are both interesting platforms and could potentially be worth more than Fitbit given their product lines. Athos — Looks interesting and they just hired a great VP of product. *For Fun — Pet Devices* — I can’t believe how many pet devices are here already. Catfi will help you remotely feed your cat, Fishbit will monitor your fish, and CleverPet will help you play with your dog while you are at work.

Enterprise

Weft — Cost of sensors and ability to transmit low power data could really change the shipping and logistics industry. Granular — Was surprising to me how many startups are in the “Smart Agriculture” space. Bastille — If IoT is adopted within enterprise applications, IoT security will be a huge market. Proteus — they produce a FDA approved chip embedded inside pills and is powered by the body itself (no battery / no sensor) to let doctors monitor if and when patients take their pills.

EPISODE THREE. The gruesome truth behind the torture…,"Chapter Eleven

THE TORTURE BEGINS

Raul is a soft-spoken man, his skin is smooth and unworried, a handsome face like something seen in cinema, not narco hit squads. He has moved on, and thanks to witness protection, he has embedded himself in America. He runs several small businesses and he has a new family. He has left the past behind, and he only talks now because agent Hector Berrellez has asked him to return to those days and tell what he saw and heard.

Raul comes from the state police. He recalls the same meetings as Berrellez’s other main informations — Godoy and Ramon—leading up to the kidnapping of Camarena, with the same cast of capos, law enforcement, major politicians, and the military. He remembers the day the Jehovah’s Witnesses rang the doorbell. They are praying to God to save them when the bullets tear into them.

“Now,” he allows, “it is a horrible thing but at the time it was what everyone was doing.”

He is at La Langosta restaurant when the two Americans enter and Caro Quintero orders them seized.

He hears Caro Quintero tell presidential hopeful Bartlett Diáz, “Remember us when you get up high.”

Twice Raul sees a different American agent at Fonseca’s home, the guy who comes for money and packs it in a garment bag. He says he’s there when Max Gomez and Bartlett Díaz come by for the money packed in cardboard boxes and Caro Quintero says, “Here’s your money, now let’s get to work.”

And he’s there at the house on Lope de Vega Street on February 7, 1985, the morning of Camarena’s capture. About 40 people have gathered including Caro Quintero and Félix Gallardo and their bodyguards. DFS personnel and state police also attend. At 12:30 p.m. a man shows up who is known to work at the American consulate and immediately the group focuses on the actual kidnapping of the DEA agent. The consulate figure tells Fonseca’s key henchman that everything is set according to the schedule “I gave you earlier.”

A caravan of four vehicles heads for the consulate. One car is dropped off as an escape option if things go bad, the others take up surveillance positions. Fonseca parks two blocks away.

Raul is in the car with the consulate employee who had insisted that Camarena would exit from the south door on Calle Libertad. It is sometime after 2 p.m. The consulate employee suddenly signals “Mira ese es [Look, there he is].” Raul and two other men exit the car and approach Camarena.

The henchman flashes his DFS credentials and says, “The comandante wants to see you.”

Camarena begins to reply, “When we are summoned and our services are needed it is done through…” This response is cut short when the officer sticks a gun into Camarena’s ribs and shoves him into the backseat of the car. Raul pulls Camarena’s jacket over his head and the man from the consulate drives the car back to the house on Lope de Vega Street. The henchman makes a brief radio announcement to those involved in the operation: “The doctor has seen the patient.”",https://medium.com/matter/blood-on-the-corn-part-iii-b13f100cbf32,['Molly Molloy'],2015-04-10 13:56:09.069000+00:00,"['Big Stories Matter', 'Crime', 'Mexico']"
Blood on the Corn: A DEA Agent is Tortured and Killed in Mexico,"Godoy is part of a small army of witnesses who are kept isolated from one another and who usually have no idea that others are stashed in the U.S. and have also become informants. They will be fresh, they will not have a chance to compare stories. They know little of the investigation because it asks questions that hardly matter to them. Enrique Camarena was a foreign agent in their country poking into their business. His torture is not significant. In Mexico, it is well known by everyone that if you are picked up by the police, you will be tortured. If you are picked up by the drug traffickers, you will be tortured. And often the same person works for the police and for the traffickers. Godoy is a perfect example: He is a policeman for the state of Jalisco who is assigned by his comandante to be Ernesto Fonseca’s personal bodyguard. He is on official assignment, on a good career track with bonuses, because Fonseca is a caring boss. And this DEA agent Enrique Camarena fell into his life like a live grenade and blew it up.

Berrellez understood that there is only one way to get to the actual killers — the powerful men who live in safety and who order their murders done for them — and that is through people like Jorge Godoy.

Years later, Godoy leans forward, his breath on my face, his eyes bulging.

“Look at me, look at my eyes” — he points two fingers at his eyes — “do they look like the eyes of a man who shoots someone in the back of the head? No, no, I only shoot in the front, not in the back.”

He is standing, leaning forward. This matters, whether it is true or not. Only in the front, not the back. Such assertions allow these men to hang on to shreds of conscience.

The informants, over 200 of them, the witnesses produced by recruiters Berrellez paid in Mexico, they are unsavory to most people because they have made careers out of crime. And some of the key witnesses had killed U.S. citizens without regrets. Prosecutors hesitate to put a man on the stand who had been part of a team that tortured and murdered two American couples, raping the wives in front of their husbands first. None of this is unusual in a criminal justice system that makes deals with the devil every day.

Berrellez finally decides out of all the informants maybe 10 could be used as witnesses. The others are simply too compromised to withstand cross-examination. But when the Camarena case began to rupture, it was not because of the crimes of the witnesses. The case ran into trouble because of what the witnesses said and the people they talked about.

They take the investigation into that room where Enrique Camarena is screaming. Because they were in the room.

EPISODE TWO. The investigation leads to the depths…,"Chapter Six

THE DIET OF A DON —

LOTS OF BEEF AND HOT PEPPERS

Jorge Godoy, the first eyewitness from the house where Camarena was murdered, sits in an anonymous office in an anonymous strip mall in Southern California. He leans over a computer and scans the blocks and byways of Guadalajara on Google Earth. Here, he points, and here and here and here, as he locates the many houses of Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, also called Don Neto, the man he served for about a year.

Godoy wears Dickies slacks, a blue shirt, glasses, and his fleshy face glows with excitement as he virtually prowls the streets where he was young and someone to be reckoned with.

He was in his mid-20s then, when the abduction, torture, and murder of the DEA agent upended his world. He is an encyclopedia of a subject seldom broached by agents or the press: the care and feeding of leaders in the drug industry. You must know the right brandy to pour, how to ease the tobacco out of a cigarette and replace it with cocaine paste (basuco). He sweats while describing the rigor required of a bodyguard who can never be off duty, the stamina needed to keep the ashtrays empty and the liquor and drugs circulating at fiestas that can last three or four days. And he has the intelligence to understand that while justice is merely a word, power is real.

Godoy’s future had looked quite different once. He went to Bell High School in Los Angeles. His mother had nursed Vietnam veterans in a hospital in Guadalajara. Jorge was determined to be a soldier. But after he graduated from high school, the U.S. Army rejected him because he was illegal. So, in 1979, he returned to Guadalajara. A friend there worked with the state attorney’s office and told Godoy he could get him on with the state police.

He looks up and says of that time, “I believed in doing justice. I had a noble heart. And I wanted to be a policeman.”

He was 17. He goes straight onto the force.

He is assigned to work with the federal police as they fly in helicopters searching for marijuana fields. They have maps with fields marked, and the maps have a simple purpose: “These ones we investigate, these we do not.” Those who pay have their crops protected, those who do not pay have their crops destroyed to satisfy the Americans.

There is a day when Godoy is a young cop and Rubén Zuno Arce, son of one of the city’s most prominent families, comes out of his fine house on Lope de Vega Street and discovers two federal policemen apparently on stakeout. He dispatches each cop with a bullet to the head. Zuno Arce has been known to DEA as a heroin trafficker since 1975. Zuno Arce’s father, former governor of the state of Jalisco, is recently dead, his body buried in a cemetery adjacent to the airport. Godoy learns that the body is being exhumed and will be reburied elsewhere; he knows Zuno will be there to observe the procedure. So Godoy and his partner drive to the airport to arrest the cop-killer. On the way, they get a call from dispatch: “Do not arrest Rubén Zuno Arce. If you do, we cannot protect you.” This is part of Godoy’s preparatory schooling before he becomes a bodyguard to Fonseca.

Later Godoy will see Zuno Arce at the parties and meetings of the drug capos. The Zuno family were founders of the University of Guadalajara, capital of the state of Jalisco. At one of the narco-fiestas, the current governor of Jalisco arrives in a dress and blond wig as a kind of wink at the proprieties of hanging out with international criminals. And virtually all of the capos have federal police credentials to ease their way through roadblocks.

The fundamentals of this system do not change. The drug world meshes with the government in a joint operation that shares money and power. The government hosts those traditional elites who have had their boot heels on the necks of the poor since long before the market for heroin, cocaine, and marijuana inflated the national economy in Mexico. The drug capos rise from the underclass, briefly flourish, then vanish into prisons or graves. The system, and the rich who thrive on the system, they endure for generations. This is the way it has always been, and for Jorge Godoy the police work and the assignment to Ernesto Fonseca’s bodyguard detail are his big chance to rise.

By 1983 he is introduced to Rafael Caro Quintero and to Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo at the Lebanese Club in Guadalajara. His corrupt commander explains, “These guys are going to be your bosses.” The group at the club includes officers from the Mexican Directorate of Federal Security (DFS), an investigative agency patterned on the FBI and trained by the CIA, and federal police. Antonio Gárate Bustamante, who later becomes an informant in the Camarena investigation, is there. During the meeting, a subordinate arrives and announces: “The mission is accomplished, we killed the guy.” Godoy will learn that fiestas do not interrupt the schedule of executions. Cigarettes are loaded up with basuco and money is handed around. He’s told to use a little coke in order to be sociable, but not too much.

Godoy enters a world without regular hours. He is to live with Fonseca and be on duty 24 hours day, seven days a week. If Fonseca got up in the middle of the night, so did Godoy.

“I would be there like a watchdog.”

The drug capos own several restaurants. After they arrive no one can enter or leave. To make up for the inconvenience, they pick up the tab for everyone. At the houses, women take care of the cooking. The bosses often have several women and each will have her own house, and a basuco-smoking priest takes care of the multiple marriages. Sometimes during the day, Fonseca would be in his room with a woman — “He looked like a Christmas tree with all his jewelry.”

The fiestas require lots of steaks. The leaders come from Sinaloa and they crave the diet of a vaquero: beef, hot peppers. And a lot of seafood, grilled or in soups. It is not a fancy diet — no matter how rich the capos get, they prefer corn tortillas to flour. They want their coffee dark and very strong.

It’s a humdrum life, the millions in drug profits sloshing around become just one more detail. There is a room where Fonseca stores ready cash and Godoy speculates that the rats chew through at least a million dollars a year that sink to the bottom of the pile. The parties roar in and consume three or four days. Godoy must attend to a room where guests can have all the drugs and liquor they desire. And women.",https://medium.com/matter/blood-on-the-corn-part-ii-b4f447d70a8c,['Molly Molloy'],2015-04-07 16:56:14.992000+00:00,"['Big Stories Matter', 'Crime', 'Mexico']"
Backed by Science: the 25-Headline Upworthy Challenge,"How we tested

Headline testing at Upworthy involves a dubious fairytale contraption to which they refer as the Magical Unicorn Box. If you’re not outfitted with one of these jobbies, that’s okay, because to test your headlines, all you really need is traffic, time, and Twitter. We followed Buffer’s protocol, which you can read more about here.

With Twitter as our lab, we sent out 4 title variations for each of the 4 articles we tested, then tracked which was the star performer. The system’s far from perfect, but the results were pretty clear.

Below is an example of one of our tests. I was deeply in love with the original title I concocted: it contained both a pun and a half-baked literary allusion to a classic Raymond Carver story. (Again — two lit degrees. I know.)

Sadly, it was not my beloved punnery that drummed up the most interest in the Twittersphere. Rather, the very simple, descriptive “4 Ways Sensational Headlines Might be Doing a Number on Your Brain” won out. And based on other tests we’ve been doing and even more reading, this makes sense. Here’s why:

What we know now

Truth #1: Descriptive headlines are the new black.

The “4 Ways” headline isn’t clever, it isn’t shocking, and there’s little curiosity gappage. According to our best source on which headlines grab the most eyes — (Yep, that’s Upworthy. They have data.) — descriptive headlines that reveal exactly what the content is are starting to rule them all.

Truth #2: We like being talked to like humans.

The above winning title talks to people like I’d talk to people if we were having a conversation. In fact, this entire article is written in a fashion I’d call conversational. Over all, people tended to respond best to headlines free from puns and any academic posturing. Turns out my mum was right: nobody likes a smartass.

Truth #3: A little jolt of fear or uncertainty goes a long way.

Nobody’s suggesting scare tactics here — in fact, I draw myself in full opposition to sensational headlineage. But the truth remains that by hinting in a headline at something a person might miss, that they might be being bamboozled, or suggesting that they’re doin’ it (whatever “it” is) wrong, you’re going to get more eyes.

Truth #4: People love numbered listicles.

They love them. You love them. I love them, even though I don’t like to admit it. The beauty of “4 Ways”-type lists is that they provide a simple, structured way for our brains to prepare for and organize the information we’re about to consume.

They also give us a very clear idea as to what sort of commitment we’re making to a text right up front, allowing us to choose to read now, read later, or TL;DR — read never.",https://medium.com/key-lessons-from-books/backed-by-science-the-25-headline-upworthy-challenge-272441d0d5e9,[],2015-07-20 18:17:41.317000+00:00,"['Content Marketing', 'Startup', 'Headlines']"
The perfect IKEA montessori bed,"Since I wrote about Oliver’s montessori bedroom all Ikea, many of you have asked me about the bed. Get ready for a trip to Ikea, because today I’m going to tell you (in as many details as possible) how we made it. It’s actually super easy.

You’ll need:

Sniglar bed structure (70x160 cm)

Sultan Lade slatted bed base (70x160 cm)

Vyssa Slappna mattress (70x160 cm)

A measuring tape

A pencil

A saw for wood (we bought a very simple one in Leroy Merlin)

Sandpaper for wood (but the one you use to smoothen walls works too)

What to do:

Go to Ikea ;-) (make sure you check the availability on the website to avoid disappointments).

Buy the Sniglar bed frame and Sultan Lade slatted bed base. The bed base doesn’t actually come in the bed frame box, so make sure you get that too.

Get back home ;-)

Assemble the bed base.

Before you start assembling the bed, you’ve got some sawing to do. Measure 2cm from where the leg starts and make a mark with your pencil on each leg. You can also cut it all off, so the structure is completely on the floor. We left 2cm because we wanted to put the carpet underneath (as you can see in the picture).

Saw the legs off (yes, just like that!). It’s easier if you have some help: I held the frame tightly while my husband sawed the leg off.

Using sandpaper, smoothen the bottom of the leg.

Finish assembling the bed.

Put slatted bed base and mattress in, and voilat! Your perfect montessori bed is done!

Two more tips:

As you can see in the pictures above, we didn’t instal the bed security bar: soon, Oliver will learn no to fall out of bed. (How? Read here!) The quilt we bought is cot size (110x125 cm): for now, it’s big enough for Oliver and it doesn’t touch the floor.

My Night During the Paris Attacks,"I was half a block from one of the Paris shooting locations last night. Here is my story.

I live in San Carlos, California, and work as a software engineer at Airbnb in San Francisco. Friday was day 2 of the 3-day Airbnb Open conference for hosts. I flew to Paris on Monday to work at the conference this week. I am staying in a private room in an Airbnb listing in the 9th Arrondissement. The owners are a delightful married couple who just started hosting recently, after their daughter left for college. They made dinner for me my first night here, and we enjoyed the evening over wine and cheese.

Thursday morning, I awoke at 4:50am to get ready for my conference shift, which started at 6am in Parc de la Villette. I worked all day, had dinner with some Airbnb hosts who were attending the conference, and went to bed that night around midnight.

Friday morning, I awoke at 4:50am again to work at the conference. When the day’s events were done, at 7pm, I made plans to go out to dinner in the La République area with some coworkers. I didn’t know any of these coworkers well, and a couple of them I didn’t know at all, so I was looking forward to connecting with them over dinner. One coworker named Jay is from our Paris office and had a car with him. So instead of taking the Metro, we drove to the restaurant where we had a reservation: Auberge Pyrénées Cévennes, at 106 rue de la Folie Mericourt in Paris. He parked around the block.

Around 9:30pm, the five of us were having a wonderful time, getting to know each other and enjoying an amazing French meal, when we heard five gunshots in less than two seconds: bang-bang, bang-bang-bang. The restaurant, which had about 30 people in it, suddenly got quiet. People looked around nervously. Some people thought someone had just set off some fireworks. To me it sounded more like gunfire. Nobody could be sure. Whatever it was, it sounded like it had come from just up the street.

The atmosphere in the restaurant had quickly turned from a lively Friday evening to unsure tension.

My French coworker started checking for news on his phone. After a couple of minutes, he exclaimed in French and told us that there had been gunfire at Le Petit Cambodge restaurant, which is 2–3 blocks away. It seemed odd that the shooting had been that far away but that we had heard it so clearly. We would find out the next day that one of the attacks had been much closer: half a block up the street at Casa Nostra restaurant (2 Rue de la Fontaine au Roi). That’s why the gunfire sounded so close: it was. We had walked past this restaurant on the way from our parking space.

A few minutes later, more news by mobile phone: a second shooting. Then more news: a third shooting. A fourth shooting. Hostages taken. All in the La République neighborhood where we were. And a bombing at the Stade de France stadium, far from where we were. We had finished our main course and had not yet had dessert, but some people in our group were thinking about going home. I recommended we shelter in place and not try to go home. We did, and almost everyone in the restaurant made the same choice.

I began contacting my wife and friends, telling them the situation and letting them know I was safe. My first text was to my wife: “I AM FINE. Possible terrorist attacks in Paris at 4 locations. Started with 5 gunshots directly outside the restaurant where I am. Love you. I am safe. ❤”

I also contacted Joel, the husband in my Airbnb host couple, to let him know I was safe but would be home very late. He was happy I was ok but was also concerned, asked me to keep giving him updates.

The restaurant staff continued serving people and were very hospitable and friendly. We were trapped but we were warm and in a place with food — very, very good food — and water and drinks. The approximately 30 diners took turns sharing the three mobile phone chargers that a few people had brought with them — an iPhone 5 charger, an iPhone 4 charger, and an Android charger.

After some time had passed, people started occasionally going outside the restaurant to see what they could see. The police had set up barricades at both ends of the small street we were on. A few people — presumably residents — were allowed in to our street, either on foot or bicycle, including one young woman with a Vespa-style scooter with the engine turned off, but no one was allowed out.

Around midnight Paris time, my 16-year-old daughter got home from school in California and heard about the attacks. She knew I was in Paris but had not been in touch with my wife, so she called me to see if I was ok. I told her I was safe in a restaurant with other people and would be there for a long time. She asked if she could tell her younger brother and sister, ages 13 and 11, about the situation. I said yes, but that she must start by saying “Dad is okay.” She should not tell the whole story and leave them hanging til the end to find out how I am.

At one point during the evening, an hour or two after the attacks, a woman — either an employee or a diner — ran back into the restaurant yelling in French, “Everybody get on the floor! Under the tables!” That was the scariest moment of the evening. We all dove under the tables and waited. It would be obvious to anyone on the street that dozens of people were inside: the lights were still on, one person was talking on his phone, and one person’s phone was still playing a news report video. We had heard that hostages had been taken at one location nearby, and I was afraid that we were a target for anyone looking to take more hostages. I posted on Facebook: “A woman diner just ran back into the restaurant and yelled everyone hit the floor. All hiding under tables now. Battery at 4%. If you don’t hear from me it’s probably just because of that.”

After several minutes, people started coming out from under the tables. I posted an update saying I was still ok. What I heard from another diner, but had no way to confirm, was that a person in a car came upon the police barrier, perhaps wanting to go home, and did not want to yield when the police insisted they could not go through the barrier. The police had fired warning shots into the air to stop the person. Those shots were what caused the woman to run back into our restaurant.

I looked in the bathroom to find a good hiding place in case anything like that happened again. I found a small broom closet that could hold a few people if necessary, and made a mental note to bring people there if anything happened again.

Google Maps said I was about a 45-minute walk away from the Airbnb listing where I was staying. Even though it’s November it was not very cold out, so that sounded like a good option. At one point I went outside and very slowly approached a policeman, with my hands visible, to ask in French if I would be allowed to go through his barricade and walk through Paris. He said no, not through his barricade, but I could go out in the opposite direction. But I chose to stay because I didn’t know how wide the circumference of the blockades was, so it might add considerable time to my walk home, and I wanted to stay with my coworkers.

At around 2:30am, the restaurant owner announced that it was ok to leave. The five of us Airbnb employees parted ways around 2:45am, most of us going in different directions. I walked a block from Le Petit Cambodge, site of one of the attacks, and took the photo of the police barricade that you see above this article. Because we had been sharing phone chargers with other diners, my battery was not fully charged. In fact it was quite low. I tried to memorize the map back home but it was complicated. I walked for a while until my phone died, then hailed a taxi to take me the rest of the way. I got there at 3:30am. My host had stayed up until 2:30 but I had told him there was no need to wait for me.

I felt wide awake. I needed to unwind and to communicate to everyone that I was safe, and to check in on my dinner friends. I stayed up for another hour and a half, until 5am. I had been awake for 19 hours on Thursday and now, on Friday night/Saturday morning, I had been up a full 24 hours. I fell asleep quickly and woke up at 12:30 in the afternoon. The Paris police were recommending that people stay where they are, rather than go out. I stayed in. Day 3 of the Airbnb conference was canceled. My Airbnb host was gracious and accommodating, allowing me to stay extra nights if necessary, even though he will be out of town. He even offered to let me stay for free, but that will not be necessary.

I am thankful to be safe. I will visit Paris again. I am sorry to Parisians and to everyone who lost loved ones yesterday.",https://medium.com/@bmorearty/my-night-during-the-paris-attacks-2cfecce60a46,['Brian Morearty'],2015-11-19 00:39:05.521000+00:00,"['Paris', 'Airbnb', 'ParisAttacks']"
"A love letter to Beirut, Paris and beyond from Sri Lanka","We don’t choose which part of the world we are born into. It’s not a decision we get to make until we are years out of utero. And sometimes this decision may be already made for us; if you end up becoming a refugee and have to take an unsafe boat and be in the mercy of the hands of smugglers, because

But whatever the reason may be, humans like you and I are strong, we are courageous and we wait it out until enough is enough.

They (neuroscience research) say that humans are the only creatures who are able to empathize with other fellow humans because of the cognitive functions bestowed in our grey matter. We have evolved, or being made this way — which ever truth you believe in, to be able to feel the pain of another human’s struggle, to be able to rejoice in joy of another human’s triumph, and this is to me is truly what makes us human even when we are miles away from them and just watching events unfold through a TV screen or a twitter feed. Today was an excellent example of this cognitive phenomena. A massacre in Paris, a car bomb in Beirut, an earthquake in Japan, and countless other attacks where we humans have given into aggression (which is controlled by a very primitive part of the brain, and not one where higher cognitive functions such as analysis or thought processing and social responsibility take place) makes me wonder if we are turning the evolutionary clock backwards and becoming less human. But the good news is that the neuroscience is in our favour, we can be trained to be more peaceful, to be more compassionate, and to be kind. And this is what we need to prime on.

So let me tell you a story of this science in action. I was born in Sri Lanka, a country that has a written history dating back 2500 years. A country that has embraced the philosophy of Buddhism for millennia. It was known by Marco Polo centuries ago as “undoubtedly one of the finest islands of its size in the world” and by Sir Arthur C. Clarke who said that “The island of Ceylon (former name) is a small universe. It contains as many variations of culture, scenery, and climate as some countries a dozen its size.” So what could possibly go wrong on this paradise island, right? But after centuries of colonization by the Portuguese, Dutch and then the British (who undoubtedly added vibrance to the mosaic of culture and heritage we have in Sri Lanka today), also came the downside of colonialism and an era of “divide and conquer”. This political culture alongside numerous bad and questionable policy decisions on part of the existing leadership at the time and the state of civil dismal, led to a 30 year old civil war, which only ended when I turned 18.

So I was part of a generation that was born and raised during a war, and although I may not have lived on the frontline, the effects of this mass atrocity of three decades will forever be part of my childhood. Living in the cosmopolitan capital city of Colombo didn’t mean I was safe, so I know what it is like to go to school every day and not know if I would make it back home safe, or if my parents would get back in one piece from work. The common occurrence of suicide bombs (especially since those responsible invented the suicide vest itself) in urban areas made me grow up to have what I call a “bomb sound reflex”, which is why even today if I hear a loud bomb-like sound, my first instinct makes me question if it was a bomb.

The first time I witnessed the catastrophical effect of this type of bloodshed was when I was five and in kindergarten. My nanny and driver picked me up from a scene of a horror movie; what looked like to me at that time the largest traffic jam of cars and people filled in red blood stains on their clothes that I had seen. That day, my headmistress lost her husband in this bomb that blew up the Central Bank and the World Trade Centre in my capital city. So humans from America, I know what 9/11 must have been like for you; we had our World Trade Centre also torn apart. Many years and explosions later, when I was Prefect in senior school (the student leadership that in-charge of the discipline of the school, much like in Harry Potter), I had to deal with, what is to date was the most challenging leadership role I have had to ever encounter. As the country was in a very volatile position of ending the civil war through military means, so was the use of innocent civilians as human shields in the war zone and those out of the war zone as collateral damage. And therefore being given training on how to act during a bomb or explosion was something we were taught even as Prefects in school, and checking the bags of students as they entered school every morning for anything suspicious became a routine procedure. But much like fire alarms and drills, you always wish you never had to use what you learned on how to deal with it because you didn’t want it to ever happen. But one day it did, there was a loud explosion, a suicide attack targeting a high ranking official, and myself together with my fellow Prefects had to follow what we were taught, and more importantly keep my classmates calm and safe until the chaos ceased.

So I may not have been in Paris with you or in Beirut or in Baghdad or wherever else your dignity was shattered through fear, and you may not have had the training I was given on how to deal with such a situation, but if you came out of this experience stronger than you were before, I salute you. There comes a day when these type of conflicts see their natural demise or an intervention that does the same job, and until then you need to be hopeful but never hateful.

Sri Lanka is and will always be the beautiful island I grew up in, regardless of which ever part of the world I decide to ever reside in the future. And even when time and again, we occasionally have to deal the distress of people driving wedges among communities; may it be through a political agenda or otherwise, I will always voice my opinion on how we need to stick together as that stunning mosaic — as serendipity. Because our differences make us beautiful and our similarities make us one, and both in conjunction is an unstoppable formula for success in every facet of life and development. So if you’re a peacemaker, never give up on that role because the world needs more of you.

So myself, together with millions of others around the world who believe in peace over conflict, love over hate, and kindness above all are with you every step of the way as you put your life back together. Let me just tell you that it is in our biology to grow stronger and more resilient after every adversity, so as it is for a bone to grow back to be much stronger after a fracture. If you don’t trust me on that, just google how bone remodelling works, and you will get your answer.

So today and tomorrow and until our days are numbered as inhabitants of this planet we call home; a planet we are renting from nature and must thus not destroy, I hope you remember two songs, “We Are The World” (not just je suis paris but nous sommes le monde) and “We Are Family”. Because every life matters, whether it is reported in the media or not, or whether Facebook decides to have a “Marked Safe” feature for a specific catastrophe or not. Because if you cut any of us open, you will see the same red blood flowing through our veins — it’s biology. And don’t let society or anyone else tell you otherwise. I hope the results of the recent events don’t shut your doors to those who may not even have what you have, a home. I hope it only strengthens you to open your doors wider to create an army of kindness. Like the way countless Sri Lankans opened their doors to strangers and friends who were targeted because of race, ethnicity, political beliefs or as a result of any other human-made social construct.

Choose love. In war, choose love. In despair, choose love. When the good and bad becomes relative concepts and appear to be grey, choose love. When you don’t know whom to blame about the magnitude of atrocities around you, choose love.

This is my love letter to you, and I hope it will open your heart to transcend borders and reinvigorate what humanity is all about.

Ayubowan. Wannakkam. Assalamu alaikum. These are all just different ways we say, may peace be with you and good vibes all the way.

From where there’s sunshine 365 days (aka Sri Lanka),

Love only,

14 Instagram Accounts That Will Feature You For Massive Exposure,"​

Instagram is for sure the most effective visual advertising channel right now. With their impressive growth in the last few months, they got every marketer’s attention. The platform itself is build to drive more engagement than any other social platform. One of the most effective ways to get the attention of as many users as possible is to get featured on one of the popular Instagram Feature Accounts.

WHAT IS AN INSTAGRAM “FEATURE” ACCOUNT?

The “feature accounts” are on a mission to discover and share unique photography in niche communities. These curators search for hidden gems through hundreds of photos each day. There’s no doubt that their purpose is to find the best of the best and inspire their audience to create more similar art.

Everybody can join these communities. You just have to use their hashtags, tag their account or sending your creations, depending on the guidelines.

Even if your picture is not featured, by using their specific hashtags, your photos will be discovered by thousands of people interested in content just like yours.

The trick is to use the hashtags that are relevant to your content and to be perseverant.

BUT, HOW TO MAKE SURE YOUR PHOTOS ARE GETTING FEATURED?

1. HAVE A CONSISTENT FEED

For a clean and consistent look, try to stick to the same filter for your photos. It will take a lot of try and error and creativity process, but when you finally get it stick with it.

To find out which filter works best, you can use tools like Iconosquare and see what type of posts get more engagement and do more of that.

Another way to ensure consistency is to find the niche or topic that best suits you and post the majority of your content in that niche. Don’t spread yourself too thin.

2. IMPROVE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY SKILLS

Invest in a good editing app. You’ll be impressed how much you can improve your photos with a simple filter. While you’re at it, learn a few editing tricks and improve your technique.

3. STUDY OTHER INSTAGRAMMERS THAT GET FEATURED

See what type of photos they post, the colors they use, filters and composition. Engage with them and try to learn from the best. Also, study the curation accounts in your niche. See what are their favorite types of photos and what they prefer to share with their audience. They want to keep their feed consistent, so if your photos are not in line with what they already share you will not be featured.

4. POST YOUR CONTENT AT THE RIGHT TIME

When you’re competing with hundreds of talented Instagram users for a spot on a feature Instagram account, the time of your posting in extremely important.

First of all don’t try to submit old photos because Instagram displays the tagged photos in chronological order. So your photos will not show up when people search for a specific hashtag.

Then, use a monitoring tool like Iconosquare to figure out what are the best times to share your photos. As you can see in the screenshot below, Iconosquare tells you what your posting habits are and when you should post based on the engagement you receive for each post.

Once you know when to post, it’s easy to create scheduled campaigns using tools like Mass Planner and share your photos at the perfect times.

Now, let’s see some of the most popular accounts that can get you featured and drive your own account to explosive growth.

The Instagram team is sharing each day the most inspiring pictures from the community. On top of that they have weekly challenges that they announce each Friday. On Monday morning, the team chooses nine favorite pictures tagged with he Weekend Challenge hashtag, and they share them with an audience of over 102 million users. That’s an impressive exposure for the lucky few. So, keep an eye on the challenges and submit your best work.

To submit a photo to be reviewed and featured by the Instagood team, you need to use the hashtag #instagoodmyphoto. The team behind the Instagood account is in a continuous search for creative, conceptual art, unique composition and use of colors. Each month they select a team designated with the searching and sharing the best pictures from the community.

2instagood is a second account managed by the same team behind the Instagood account. They have pretty much the same rules: a specific hashtag #2instagoodportraitlove to use for the submitted works. Just like for Instagood they choose a team of curators from the community (you can be one of them!). The difference is that this account focuses on portraits and fashion photography. If your content is in this category, go ahead and tag your best work!

The JustGoShoot team is on a mission to provide exposure to talented, underrated photographers and to develop a growing community. To join the community, you need to use the #justgoshoot hashtag.

Thepeoplescreatives is another feature account that shares people’s creative pictures each day. Like the say in their own description: “You create. We curate. “ Use the hashtag #peoplescreatives and you get the chance to get featured and get tons of exposure from their community of engaged creators.

The Visuals Collective team tries to bring the concept of visual storytelling through unique photographs shared by adventurous travelers. Let your imagination run free and come up with the most impressive visual stories and tag them with #exploretocreate to be featured.

As you could easily guess this is a community of travelers, that love to share their memories and inspire other people to travel too. Their feed is full of unique places to visit and experience. Tag your own travel memories with #passionpassport and your pictures will get in front of a large travel community.

This is another Instagram account that focuses on travel photography. To share your photos, you need to tag them or contact them via e-mail. The advantage of the existence of so many travel feature accounts is that you can submit the same photos and increase your chances.

The Outbound Collective is dedicated to outdoor activities and adventures. You simply need to tag your favorite adventures with #theoutbound and get featured by the outbound team.

Another account for your authentic travel memories. Tag your creative visual stories with #livefolk and get featured.

Live Folk is similar to the Folk Magazine account. They share unique, authentic stories from around the world. To submit your photos, you need to use the #lifeofadventure hashtag or tag their account.

While you’re at travel photos, here’s another account that might feature your creations. Capture new places or old places but from a different, unusual angle and tag them with #BestVacations.

World Travel Book is the last travel photography oriented Instagram account on our list. Their hashtag is #worldtravelbook and for more exposure you can use more related hashtags. The account’s authors surely won’t mind as long as you submit original photos.

The travel, landscape, and colorful photography is certainly the most popular category on Instagram right now. But here are a few brave artists that want to express their stories in black and white. It’s difficult not to rely on colors when creating impressive compositions, but it’s not impossible. If black and white photography is your thing, then you should follow the Monoart account and try to get featured. Use the #monoart_ hashtag and you will find other photographers passionate by monochromatic photography.

13 reasons to not vote for Jeremy Corbyn to be leader of the Labour Party,"13 reasons to not vote for Jeremy Corbyn to be leader of the Labour Party Labour Pains Aug 16, 2015·7 min read

The vast majority of the people who have joined the Labour Party to vote for Jeremy Corbyn aren’t mendacious Trotskyite infiltrators, but ordinary voters who want an alternative to modern capitalism. But that doesn’t mean they’re not completely, utterly wrong to think that Jeremy Corbyn is the right choice for Labour. Here’s 13 reasons (although there are many more) why people who can vote in Labour’s leadership election should take a step away from the brink.

Corbyn’s economic policies don’t make any sense.

Pretending Government can solve the UK’s problems by creating money with no negative consequences is irresponsible and wrong. As Robert Peston explains here, as soon as a Government printed money to build houses and roads, (like it or loath it) currency markets would dump the pound. That would push inflation up, making goods more expensive and ordinary people poorer. Trying to persuade sceptical voters that all their problems will be solved if the Government just prints more money is going to be impossible. If there was a easy cost free fix to all of the problems of a modern economy, then surely more countries would be using it?

2. Corbyn’s plans to clamp down on tax evasion are a fantasy.

Jeremy Corbyn’s plans to pay for all his spending commitments from a £120bn crackdown on tax evasion. Tha sound great at first. But if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Jolyon Maugham’s clear explanation of why Governments can’t simply just summon £120bn from the tax gap explains this well. The idea that you can fund everything you ever want without any compromises is a fantasy.

3. Corbyn can’t persuade Tory voters to vote Labour.

Imagine you’re in your fifties. You own your own house. You don’t live in London. You voted Tory in 2010 and 2015 but voted Labour under Blair. You thought Ed Miliband was weird and too left wing. You are by all means a typical voter. How likely are you to be persuaded by a beardy London socialist who wants to increase taxes? There is absolutely no way for Labour to win in Nuneaton, Plymouth, Stockton, Bury or Dover without persuading some voters who previously supported the Tories. Do you really, honestly, think it’s likely that Jeremy Corbyn can do that? All the evidence suggests he can’t.

4. Lots of people attending rallies does not mean that Corbyn is popular.

Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign has so far been incredibly successful at creating a mass movement of people who already agree with him. That’s the easy bit. Packing out a hall with 1000 people to listen to political speeches is pretty impressive. But in no way does that mean that the message in the hall is one shared by the country at large. Managing to get the same attendance for a campaign rally as a low ranking non league football team can muster on a rainy Monday night really isn’t a sign you’re about to cruise to electoral victory.

5. Corbyn won’t shift the country leftwards — he’ll give the Tories a free hand.

Governments are, to some extent, restrained by opposition parties. If the Tories see that Labour has a good shot of getting into Government, they’ll be less likely to pursue unpopular policies which will hurt ordinary people. Jeremy Corbyn being elected Labour leader would give George Osborne and friends a free hand. If Labour has a leader who the majority of the public will not under any circumstances elect then there’s no need for the Tories to broaden their appeal. Instead of shifting the country leftwards, Corbyn as Labour leader would give the Government carte blanche to slash the public sector, remove employment rights and attack welfare even further.

6. Corbyn wants to reopen the mines.

This policy announcement is pretty telling. Corbyn isn’t interested in the environmental cost of coal. It doesn’t matter to him that the mines closed in the 1980s have largely been flooded (and so can’t be reopened). It doesn’t matter to Corbyn that cleaner, cheaper fuel is available. It doesn’t matter that mining was a hazardous job and has left a legacy of bronchitis, mesothelioma and blackened lungs.

Instead of looking to future, Corbyn wants to power the UK with nostalgia.

Yes — closing mines in the 1980s destroyed communities. But you can no more magic those mining jobs back than you can reopen the cotton mills, or re-employ the people who used to wave flags in front of cars on the roads.

7. Jeremy Corbyn wants to pull out of NATO.

NATO, (created by Clement Attlee of 1945 fame) is a club of Western democracies who (broadly) respect their citizens’ human rights. In the other corner is the vile, autocratic Russia, where racists attack gay people and ethnic minorities — all with the blessing of the police. The world isn’t getting any safer, but Corbyn wants to abandon France, Germany, the USA, Denmark, Norway and Poland so he can cozy up to Vladimir Putin. He might have opposed Iraq from the start, but Corbyn does seem mighty relaxed about Russia’s illegal war in the Ukraine. Leaving NATO is madness.

8. Non voters don’t vote. And when they do, they vote rightwing.

Some Corbyn supports claim Jezza will ride to victory on a wave of newly converted apathetic voters. But the awkward thing about non voters is that they very rarely vote. Basing an electoral strategy on making non voters go to the polls is like creating a business plan for a butchers shop reliant on attracting vegetarians. It’s not going to work. Even if non voters did start voting (and turnout did increase in the 2015 election) TUC research shows that non voters have broadly the same politics as those who do vote.

9 . But no candidates can win!

If you’re underwhelmed by Labour’s field of candidates- then fair enough. Maybe you think no candidate can win, so you might as well be happy and vote Corbyn. But that attitude is like letting sensible scepticism of whether dieting could work for you mean that you give up all exercise and sit on the couch eating giant bars of chocolate. Maybe you’re right. Maybe no candidate can win an election outright for Labour. But the Tories have a 16 seat majority in Parliament. With a competent leader, Labour could easily win 20 to 30 seats and remove the Government’s ability to legislate or allow Labour to form a minority Government. That’s a lot better than wallowing in defeatism.

10. What about Syriza and Podemos?

Greece and Spain have youth unemployment over 50%. Greece’s economy has shrunk by 25% since 2007. The majority of people in both countries feel significantly poorer. The UK, meanwhile, has rising wages and low unemployment. The economy has recovered. There are still vulnerable people who need help. But you can’t base an electoral strategy in the UK around only attracting the votes of the very poorest. Even in Spain, as the economy has started to recover, the left-wing Podemos party have been losing support.

11. Isn’t a right-wing Labour Government just as bad a Tory government?

If by a right-wing Labour Government you mean the one between 1997 and 2010 that created Sure Start, lifted millions out of poverty, chucked billions into the NHS and schools, created paid holiday and maternity and paternity leave, invented EMA and tax credits and brought in the Minimum Wage, then I’d say it’s a bit different from a Tory Government. Almost everything that Corbyn opposes Tories cutting was brought in by the last Labour government, so it can’t have been all bad eh?

12. I want a woman leader of the Labour Party.

I’m voting for Yvette Cooper partly (but by no means solely) because I want a woman to lead Labour. The boring retort that parties should pick on the basis of talent not gender is a bit let down by the fact that the people making this argument seem to always think the only people who have any talent are the men. Its almost 40 years since the Tories decided to elect Margaret Thatcher. It’s going to get a bit embarrassing if Labour waste this opportunity to pick a woman and end up 50 years behind.

13. If Corbyn wins, some people have a lot to lose.

If you’ve read all the above and want to take a risk and elect Jeremy Corbyn, then fair enough. But on whose behalf are you taking that risk? If you’re financially secure, you can probably afford to risk Cameron/Osborne/Johnson/May remaining in power until 2030. Personally, I reckon I should be OK. There are, however, lots of people in the UK who won’t be all right if the Tories win and keep winning. They’re going to lose out big when public services and welfare are destroyed. So if you want to take a gamble on Corbyn, have a bit of a think about whose futures you’re gambling with. If you can afford another 15 years of the Tories, do remind yourself that there’s other people who can’t.",https://medium.com/@Labour_Pains/13-reasons-not-to-vote-for-jeremy-corbyn-as-leader-of-the-labour-party-11d5656cac88,['Labour Pains'],2015-08-16 19:25:29.811000+00:00,"['UK Politics', 'Labour Party']"
The 6 Principles of Influence: How To Master Persuasion,"Influence is power. Maybe even a super power. Imagine being able to harness influence as a skill. To be able to use it when the situation calls. The truth is, this is more possible than you may have thought, thanks to research done over the years.

One book in particular has had the biggest impact in this field: Robert Cialdini’s Influence. In it, Cialdini introduces the 6 principles of influence that will help you persuade others. Theses 6 principles are reciprocity, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity.

“I think the power of persuasion would be the greatest super power of all time.” Jenny Cullen

Persuasion as a superpower is very much within reach. In this post, we’ll explore these six principles more closely and how you can use them. And if you want to learn more, be sure to check out the book.

1. Reciprocity

One of the most basic principles of influence is to simply give that which you want to receive. In other words, doing right by others is a good way to get others to do the same for you. This idea of reciprocity is a powerful one.

There are a couple of ways to have this reciprocity work for you. Giving others small gifts, treating others with respect, and doing favors for those in need, are all things that can win you points with other individuals.

So a good approach is to always help others and be kind when you have the opportunity, because you never know how it may help you down the line. Moreover, it is these small acts of kindness that will be remembered and come in handy when you’re in need of a favor yourself.

2. Consistency

The principle of consistency is based on the power of active, public, and voluntary commitments, which results in people actually sticking to their word. Let’s walk through these requirements in a little more detail. The first part is an active commitment. By active, Cialdini means something that is written or spoken to other’s. Having people say they will do something is a start, but when they actively commit to it they’re much more likely to follow through.

The next piece is making it public. When other’s witness this commitment, it adds a level of accountability to the statement. And no one wants to go back on their word.

Finally, it has to be voluntary. If you force someone to make an active, public commitment that they didn’t decide on themselves, you’ve accomplished nothing.

So how do you use this? Once you’ve persuaded someone to do something, get them to make these types of commitments to implement the principle of consistency and ensure there is a legitimate commitment to their words.

3. Social Proof

People rely on social cues from others on how to think, feel, and act in many situations. And not just any people, but peers. People they believe are similar to them. This is a key point and what is called social proof.

So if you wanted to influence your interns or a particular team in your department or the new hires, you need to get one of them to buy in first. When they see an employee like themselves seemingly taking action on their own or following a new directive, they are more probable to follow suit.

Having that first person take action makes all the difference and unlocks the power of social proof.

4. Liking

People like those who like them or who they perceive as friends. It’s a simple, yet powerful idea. The principle of liking can be used in a few different ways.

One method is finding common ground with the people you meet. If you can connect with them on their hobbies or interests, you’ll have a solid ground to build from. Being observant of people is a great way to pick up on any clues that may lead you to such common ground.

The other approach is genuine praise. Paying compliments and being charming can go along way to building a positive rapport with others. A word of warning though, don’t go overboard. The key here is genuine praise, don’t manufacture it to the point that you’re clearly trying to butter them up.

5. Authority

When you are perceived as an expert in an area, other’s will be more likely to defer to you. Why? Often because experts are able to offer a shortcut to good decisions that would otherwise take a long time to devise themselves. The idea then is to establish that credibility of authority and expertise.

Many often miss this opportunity because they assume others will identify their expertise automatically. You can’t leave it up to interpretation because it will often be overlooked.

There are a number of ways to establish such authority. A quick and easy one is to make visible all diplomas, credentials, and awards in the office or workplace to establish your background. Of course this may not always be an option. Another approach is to convey expertise through short anecdotes or background information shared in casual conversations.

Just remember, your expertise isn’t always a known quantity, so be sure to convey it when you get the chance.

6. Scarcity

People value what is scarce. It’s just basic supply and demand. As things become more scarce, they becoming more valuable to others. There are a few ways that you can use the principle of scarcity to persuade others. One is simply to make offers limited-time, limited-supply, or one-time, which immediately creates a sense of scarcity.

At the same time, how you present such opportunities matters too. If you focus more on loss language, or language that demonstrates what you will lose out on rather than gain, your message becomes more powerful.

Finally is the exclusivity approach. Providing access to information, services, or other items to a limited set of people creates a sense of exclusiveness. This often gets translated into being a favor to those people or that you value them more than others.

If you can combine all of these to frame a situation, your powers of persuasion greatly increase. So try to utilize limited offers, loss language, and exclusivity, to create a sense of scarcity.",https://medium.com/@alyjuma/the-6-principles-of-influence-how-to-master-persuasion-2f8c581da38b,['Aly Juma'],2015-12-22 17:40:09.024000+00:00,"['Influence', 'Persuasion', 'Lifehacks']"
Big Brand Logo Redesign — Before and After Comparision,"Logos are the most publicly recognizable branding a brand can have, customers can easily identity a brand by its logo and usually associate trust with logos they can identify.

About Schmidt: How a White Nationalist Seduced Anarchists Around the World (Chapter 1),"by Alexander Reid Ross and Joshua Stephens

[This article is the first in a multi-part series. Subsequent articles will follow a publication timeline, across the next two weeks. Chapter 2 will appear October 14th. The authors encourage readers to absorb each piece, with its corresponding documentation, in full]

The Basest Service to the Revolution

On a sunny day in July 2008, six months before the publication of Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism (Counter Power, Vol. 1), co-author, Michael Schmidt, met with fellow members of the Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front (ZACF) at his cozy bungalow in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was a gorgeous day, so the four collective mates sat down comfortably on Schmidt’s wooden furniture in his spacious garden, near a lemon tree while his White Swiss Shepherd puppies, Loki and Freya, came out to sniff their guests.

There was a lot going on in Schmidt’s life. He was in the midst of working on Black Flame alongside academic Lucien van der Walt — a work that, since publication in early 2009, has sold roughly 4,000 copies. According to Charles Weigl, a collective member at the book’s publisher, AK Press, “the average nonfiction book in the US sells less than 250 copies a year, and 3,000 over its lifetime.” Sales-wise, Black Flame stood shoulder to shoulder with recent editions of works from some of anarchism’s most recognized names, and Weigl told us that Black Flame was “still selling steadily,” until late this past September.

However, as internal secretary of the ZACF, Schmidt had taken time out of his busy schedule to host a meeting in a different context. Part of the business of the meeting was a “confidential discussion document” circulated by Schmidt titled “Politico-Cultural Dynamics of the South African Anarchist Movement” (which will be referred to as “Politico-Cultural Dynamics” from this point on). One person at the meeting, who asked not to be named for this piece, recalled, “Michael asked about thoughts on the document. Everyone was awkwardly quiet and pretended they hadn’t read it.”

The text at the center of discussion that July day was his take on why anarchist organizing had foundered in post-apartheid South Africa. “Blacks,” he wrote, are “incapable of other than the basest service to the Revolution.” Schmidt explained that while the best anarchist militants “have almost without exception been proven to be whites,” black anarchists, “while good comrades, have not been up to the exacting standards” required of them. He goes on to state that “in [South Africa], where race is often more important than class as a determining factor in consciousness, we find that white anarchist militants are the de-facto leading echelon, while most black anarchist militants merely follow.”

Due to “Bantu national education” and economic disparities facing black people in South Africa, Schmidt claims, “logical process, self-discipline and autonomous strategic thinking has been strangled at birth.” He goes on to list an alphabet soup of different international groups that he claims gain strength from cultural homogeneity, and presents the ZACF as “a white politico-cultural anarchist movement” that cannot “merge” with “the black politico-cultural anarchist movement… at this stage of history.”

Schmidt states that white culture is not culturally identical by calling on his relationship with Black Flame co-author, van der Walt: “For example, Lucien considers himself a ‘European settler,’ despite his Afrikaner heritage, whereas I consider myself an ‘Afrikaner’ or ‘white African’ despite my Anglophone heritage.”

“So, are [South African (SA)] black anarchists unequal to the task [of revolutionary organizing]?” Schmidt asks, well into the document. “After 16 years of activism, I’m forced to say no — as long as the task is established for them under the influence of SA white anarchists.” In other words, black South Africans are equal to the task, but only if the terms of struggle are defined by South African white anarchists. The platform, in this case established by Schmidt and a cohort of white colleagues, becomes a compass to lead allegedly feeble-minded Africans toward their own liberation.

Black Flame, White Blindspot

Such a compass was in the works, as Schmidt and van der Walt worked on their book through the coming months. At five hundred pages, Black Flame is widely considered the first major (non-anthology) work in some time — perhaps ever — to provide a global historical account of anarchist movements. Many viewed the work as a kind of “Anarchist Bible,” or what Immanuel Ness, a professor at City University of New York and author of New Forms of Worker Organization: The Syndicalist and Autonomist Restoration of Class-Struggle Unionism (PM Press, 2014), had described as “perhaps the most important contribution [to] the global history of working class movements from an anarchist perspective.”

While its proletarian message rang true to many, Black Flame did not come without its controversy. The construction of anarchism one finds in its pages is keenly specific, and strikes a deliberate contrast with contemporaneous anarchist literature seeking to grapple with the gritty realities of anarchist practices increasingly deployed by on-the-ground struggles. Alongside the influence of prison-abolition movements, post-structural theory, and leftist solidarity for Indigenous uprisings like the Zapatistas in Mexico, a variety of shifts reaching back some two-decades had effectively put the anarchist tradition’s classical preoccupations with capitalism and the State on equal footing (and in conversation) with struggles around patriarchal and racial domination, Indigenous and gender self-determination, colonialism, and disability. In contradistinction, the construction of anarchism put forth by Black Flame reasserts a temptingly simple primacy of class struggle and workers’ movements with the not inconsiderable force of “big A Anarchism.”

Black Flame maintains historical roots in what its authors deem the “broad anarchist tradition,” drawing from what is known as platformism. Andy Cornell, formerly the Anarchist Studies postdoctoral fellow at Haverford College and author of Unruly Equality: U.S. Anarchism in the Mid-20th Century (forthcoming, University of California Press), argues the tendency emerged in the first decade of the Russian Revolution, reckoning with the direction of the left in the hands of the Bolsheviks. “[Platformists] felt the Russian anarchist movement, and the international movement more generally, was theoretically weak and had insufficient organization to push the revolution in an anarchist direction,” Cornell explained. “So they argued for an anarchism that was more clearly committed to class struggle, and that accepted formal organizations. [Basically,] figure out an organizational structure, develop a strategy, [and] stick to it.”

In Schmidt’s view, the politics of race, gender, sexuality, and other forms of what he calls “identitarianism” are implicit within revolutionary class struggle, so centering them rather than class leads to compromises and half-measures. Perforce, reading Black Flame, one is hard-pressed not to discern this contempt for “identity politics,” and in its indictments, the voices cited are conspicuously white.

Noel Ignatiev, the white firebrand behind the journal Race Traitor, figures as often and substantively in Black Flame as W. E. B. du Bois. Curiously, Schmidt and van der Walt misidentify Ignatiev as a “former-Maoist.” In fact, Ignatiev’s big claim to fame came in 1967, with an article critical of the Maoist tendency within Progressive Labor, published along with Theodore W. Allen’s famous essay, “The White Blindspot,” recalling du Bois’s brilliant book, Black Reconstruction (published in 1935).

A Sordid History

Like most white men until conscription was abolished in 1993, Schmidt was drafted into the South African military, which was putting down black unrest during the end of apartheid. This, he claims, radicalized him, and he visited Rwanda as a journalist just after the genocide of 1994, growing increasingly politicized. Professionally, he appears to have been respected more for his administrative capabilities than his journalism. He founded the Professional Journalists’ Association of South Africa (ProJourn) and The Ulu Club for Southern African Conflict Journalists, and has a personal network of associates that spans an influential set of counter-culture celebrities and highly-regarded media figures.

In conversations with some who’ve known him personally, Schmidt is described as warm and sensitive — a beguiling and experienced man, with a gloominess carried from his time in Rwanda, where as a journalist, he witnessed horrors such as “piles of dead bodies” stacked in warehouses. He is open about his PTSD. From other, less-sympathetic accounts, he figures as an intellectual gatekeeper prone to contrarianism and rowdy outbursts during bouts of drinking. He is known to have come to blows with at least one friend during heated arguments fueled by alcohol.

“Politico-Cultural Dynamics,” however, offers a more intimate portrait of Schmidt’s organizing career. During the 2003 drafting of the constitution for the previous incarnation of the Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Federation, Schmidt declares that he proposed a strategy based on the Brazilian group Federação Anarquista Gaúcha, which maintained a “‘specific’ core, with outlying nodes of social insertion.” With this structure in mind, Schmidt called for distinguishing racially distinct collectives for whites and for “less ideologically convinced black cadre.”

He continues, “My attempt during the drafting of the ZACF Constitution to have this divide explicitly recognized as (white) rearward collectives and (black) frontline collectives was defeated as it was felt this would unduly emphasize the race/class divide in the Federation.”

The defeat of Schmidt’s attempt to create ideologically and structurally separate collectives for white and black cadres is important, inasmuch as it shows that Schmidt’s racialized understanding of platformism was and is not widely shared. While the relative silence that followed the defeat of his proposal raises critical questions, it appears that Schmidt’s explicit use of “the platform” as an intellectual power structure best understood and controlled by whites was of his own making.

This was a major change that broke down the collaborative aspect of the federation — in particular, doing away with action groups in places like the 99%-black township of Umlazi. Within two years of his initial, rejected frontline/rear guard proposal, the Federation had been cut in half; two years after that, in 2007, it was dissolved completely. According to Schmidt, this change took place, due to its black members’ “ill-discipline, inactivity or a lack of theoretical understanding.”

However, the Federation was re-founded as the Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front with a new structure. Schmidt explains the implications: “[T]he organization lost its last black members in **Swaziland**, reducing it from a biracial ‘international’ organization to a white ‘national’ organization.” The ZACF had gone from a six-branch, multiracial anarchist Federation that was too broad to have a membership roster, but was engaged in activities throughout South Africa and in Swaziland, to an all-white group with only six members dedicated specifically to the development of ideology and propaganda.

According to Schmidt’s “Politico-Cultural Dynamics,” he had been there every step of the way — first advocating unsuccessfully for a racial divide in the Federation in 2003, then arguing for a political hardening into three collectives in 2005, then finally re-founding the group as a “white ‘national’ organization” in 2007, with some six members and three “supporters.” Considering what Schmidt named as his own cultural understandings of his Afrikaner identity, it is clear that he puts “national” in quotations to connote white South Africans who share a common “culture,” which he understands as a standard for organizational specificity and unity.

“[T]he underlying ideology at work here, [is] a more or less direct inheritance of the European New Right. That is why the ‘culture’ / ‘race’ nexus seems so important to him,” says Peter Staudenmaier, an historian at Marquette University and co-author (with Janet Biehl) of Eco-Fascism: Lessons from the German Experience, reflecting on Schmidt’s internal document. “There is a lengthy tradition, especially after 1945, of shifting ‘race’ talk to ‘culture’ talk without really changing the content, and it’s that same conceptual fuzziness that the far right plays on (the radical left hasn’t done much to clarify the fuzziness either). In that sense, this story is a good example of anarchists’ failure to work through the complexities of race not only at a political level, but at an intellectual level.”

Schmidt’s conclusion of “Politico-Cultural Dynamics” is summed up in one telling passage: “[P]erhaps we should not be too quick to seek partially-qualified black members, or be ashamed of our whiteness — for we after all reject both the Maoist theory of ‘white skin privilege’, and the radical counter-theory of ‘race-traitorship. Instead we should proudly recognize that we are (currently, and presumably temporarily) a white anarchist movement.”

Thus, Schmidt encourages the “white ‘national’ organization” to be proud of itself as forming the “white anarchist movement” after purging black militants, who he describes as ill-disciplined, lagging, and incapable of meeting “the exacting standards of platformism.” It was those “exacting standards of platformism that Schmidt would attempt to explain with Lucien van der Walt in Black Flame, gaining greater influence throughout the world through their widely read book. Through Schmidt’s attempts to reconstruct the platform, it would seem as though he saw himself as leading the whites in laying out the “task” of revolution for the “ideologically less convinced” people of color whose “inactivity” had brought about the failure of the anarchist movement in South Africa. However, across more than a hundred pieces of evidence, we located far more sinister ideas at work in Schmidt’s own handiwork whittling the ZACF from a multi-collective federation down to an all-white intellectual “front,” and blaming it on people of color.

Errata: The authors would like to note that Ignatiev does in fact seem to have been briefly a member of a tendency close to Maoist analysis. This, however, does not change the fact that “white privilege” analysis developed from WEB du Bois on, and in a critical relation to Maoism. It is not “Maoist,” as such.

"9 things I learnt about South Africa, thanks to time in Australia","For the second time this year, I spent a week in Western Australia doing some consulting work for an Australian retail client.

Time away from South Africa is wonderful.

Apart from the obvious joys of international travel, time away allows you to get an alternative perspective of your home country that’s all to often clouded by the day-to-day experience of actually living within its borders.

Perhaps it’s the result of years of boarding school, but I never miss home when I’m abroad. The excitement of meeting foreign people, being in unusual places and tasting exotic food is way too alluring to allow for a moment of homesickness.

But on this most recent trip, I did stop (just for a slight moment) to consider what Australia allowed me to realise about South Africa.

Here are some of those thoughts:

1. South Africa is a cheap place to live

The cost of living in Australia is crazy.

A take-away coffee and a toasted cheese & ham sandwich from a drive-thru — will cost you R100. Middle-class houses in Perth go for around R20 million and a pint of craft beer will easily cost you R150.

On the day that I arrived back in South Africa, I bought a good bottle of local wine at a beachfront restaurant for R159 with a big smile on my face.

2. South Africa has some world-class talent

As a nation we lack confidence, but in many individual cases, we have some of the brightest and most talented people in the world.

Perhaps its genetic — a spirit of creativity and innovation passed on from our forefathers, or maybe the challenging business environment breeds people with drive, determination and mad talent. But South Africans can be proud of the work that they do when compared to their international counterparts.

We have some top schools and universities that are on par with revered global institutions and a strong private sector that together produce graduates and working professionals that punch way above their weight division.

What isn’t as good is what South African talent gets paid. Compared to their counterparts in developed countries, skilled labour in South Africa is dirt cheap.

3. South Africans are natural hustlers

Maybe because making money in South Africa is tough, we tend to be natural dealmakers and problem solvers. In comparison, most Australians are laid back and, in a work environment at least, happy to stick to the status quo.

As an emerging market and ‘the gateway to the African continent’ — now is the time to turn up the volume on that hustle. Cause when you hit ‘first-world status’, a lot of that ‘street energy’ will dissipate.

4. Crime and corruption are the main reasons we are not growing

It’s an infinite feedback loop and for some an obvious point, but the scourge of violent crime in South Africa has killed vast quantities of business growth.

When the streets are unsafe, good people and the business they would be supporting, flee to expensive shopping malls.

Rent in those malls is a prohibitive cost for smaller business and as a result the economy is squeezed into the pockets of a few well-capitalised corporates. When would-be entrepreneurs lack viable opportunities to start new ventures because of unsafe streets, you have an economy in terminal decline.

Jobs disappear and the situation continuously just goes from bad to worse as a result.

The answer to the problem is a co-ordinated policy approach, which lies with government. But the money we pay in taxes to help them to fix this exact issue, is being stolen by the very people who have pledged to be the guardians of that growth.

Why those people, who are responsible for this theft, are not charged with a criminal offence of the highest degree, is completely beyond me.

As a society, we should be demanding justice on this issue, which is at the heart of many societal problems that we worry about everyday. The real criminals here are the ‘leaders’ that are stealing from all of us. It’s our duty to make a lot more noise about it.

5. The South African economy is tiny

When you drive around a city like Perth, you are struck by the sheer number of retailers that operate in that economy. You literally can’t drive 300m without passing yet another business park filled with ‘big box‘ warehouse stores.

They have specialist ‘supermarkets’ the size of your average Pick n Pay for random things like pets, fishing gear, rugs and kitchenware.

It’s really is depression when you think that Perth has a population of less than half of the city of Cape Town (1.8 million vs 3.7 million), but has a GDP which is more than double the size (US$138 billion vs US$58 billion).

It’s not that having loads of shopping outlets should be the ultimate nirvana for a society, but at least having more participation in the economy of the country by its citizens should be a goal.

6. South Africans are a spirited bunch

Get onto a plane where you are in the presence of South Africans for the first time in a week — and you’ll realise how full of energy and stories we are. We’re also not afraid to share that energy with everyone in earshot of us.

It makes me think that we’re all extroverts and probably why we are so good at music, dancing and protesting.

Australians in general are older and more stuck in their ways — the vibrancy of a young population in South Africa is encouraging.

7. Inequality is hurting South African small business — in a big way

Australia has 26 million people living in it and almost all of them are in the middle class. They have 26 million people who are able to participate in the economy. That’s 26 million people who are making a tax contribution and growing the economy.

In South Africa, just 2 people have more wealth than 50% of all South Africans.

25% of the South African population is unemployed; and probably another 25% is radically under-employed. Because of this — we just don’t have the market to sustain opportunities for small business to flourish.

There’s sadly very little point in promoting small business growth if there is no market for goods and services to support it.

Once again, a proper policy framework from government is needed to rectify this. There is more than enough money to do that, but as you know, that money is either being wasted or stolen by the public servants who are tasked with managing it.

Tackling the inequality issue is the only way you are going to jump start the economy and create an environment which is small business friendly. There are only just so many small businesses that the DTI can help to become competitive exporters, the real growth must come ultimately from domestic demand.

8. South Africa wine still has some way to go

A two-hour drive from the city, Margaret River is the wine growing region south of Perth.

It’s beautiful there.

I really didn’t want to like Australian wine, but try as I might — I couldn’t help closing my eyes and questioning reality itself after tasting some of their Chardonnays.

Even though most of them are oak-aged for 9 months, they were fresh and crisp and ridiculously well-made.

The tasting room at Vasse Felix looks like the bridge of The Death Star and when you get tired of drinking good wine, there are craft beer breweries peppered around every corner.

There are hundreds of wine farms down there and on the Saturday that we visited, every single one of the estate restaurants that we phoned for a lunch booking, was full.

It felt like the region was a co-originated tourist destination that took every opportunity to make money from visitors. The product was good, the service from everyone was warm and they were not shy with their prices.

It’s like Disneyland for adults armed with tastebuds.

I’m still the biggest fan of South African wine, but there is a doctorate to be earned by researching some of the business ideas from the Australian industry.

9. Over-regulation kills innovative thinking

One of the reasons South Africans are so resourceful is that there are few rules to kill our innovation. In Australia you can’t do anything without putting up a safety warning sign, donning a bright-orange bib or applying for a licence.

Even allowing customers to take food home from a restaurant in a doggie bag is against the health and safety laws there; and as a consequence, lots of great ideas are killed before they can be considered.

Consider yourself lucky that you still live in a place where the blue-rinse brigade aren’t ruling the roost just yet.

It seriously dampens the creative mojo.",https://medium.com/@Cherryflava/9-things-i-learnt-about-south-africa-thanks-to-time-in-australia-4a509340ed6f,[],2015-11-18 11:28:51.907000+00:00,"['Perspective', 'Australia', 'South Africa']"
The full-stack employee,"What is a full stack employee?

Just as there are full-stack engineers and full-stack startups, the full-stack employee has a powerful combination of skills that make them incredibly valuable. They are adept at navigating the rapidly evolving and shifting technological landscape. They make intuitive decisions amidst information-abundance, where sparse facts mingle loosely with data-drenched opinions. Full stack employees are capable of speaking design lingo, know that using Comic Sans is criminal, and are adept at making mocks in Keynote, Sketch, or Skitch (if it comes to that). And they know the difference between UI and UX.

They can cross the aisle to talk to engineering and can make sense of algorithms, programming, and instinctively understand that scaling the backend isn’t the same as scaling the frontend. Though they may not code for production, they understand what GitHub and StackOverflow are for, and can brute force a copy-paste script to perform basic analysis on a CSV file. If they must.

They’re on the latest social apps, and know how to self-promote. Tastefully (most of the time; for the rest, there’s Snapchat). They use narrative and storytelling to involve their audience, but have watched enough three minute Kickstarter videos to know that they need to get to their point in less time than it takes to watch an Instagram video, if not a Vine. Attention is the currency of the age.

Full stack employees have an insatiable appetite for new ideas, best practices, and ways to be more productive and happy. They’re curious about the world, what makes it work, and how to make their mark on it. It’s this aspect above others that defines and separates the full stack employee from previous generations. Full stack employees can’t put blinders on once they land a job; instead they must stay up on developments in their industry and others, because they know that innovation is found at the boundaries between disciplines, not by narrowly focusing in one sphere.

What it’s like to be a full stack employee

Being a full stack employee isn’t necessarily easier or harder; it’s different. With always-on connectedness via their mobile devices, the boundaries between work and non-work blur, creating an implicit expectation that there’s never a time too late for a Slack chat or Google Hangout. This may or may not work out well. YMMV.

With constant internet access comes constant distraction (tragically in the form of another time-wasting listicle on being more productive). And since much of their work involves slicing through thick ambiguity — they’re given to radical clarity in certain lifestyle choices, from adopting monolithic, monochromatic wardrobes to functional culinary choices:

Photo by Soylent

Being full stack is an exercise in shifting between opposite poles. While there’s often less support for individual work and a greater expectation of self-sufficiency (i.e. setting their own hours, using their own devices for work, etc), they’re also expected to collaborate and work in groups effectively. Previously, you’d have an IT manager select the technology for a large team, but with the increasing reliance on self-provided mobile devices, individuals are left to figure out how to communicate across and connect over different platforms. Indeed, Slack, the winningest enterprise tool du jour, integrates with everything, opposite Microsoft’s latter-day strategy of privileging its own platform over all others. These days, if you haven’t integrated with everyone else’s API, you’re already behind. And that’s true of full stack employees too — they must have at least passing knowledge of all the latest apps lest they fall behind and as a result, out of the loop.

Yet full stack employees are expected to deeply understand their domain, but also dynamically deal with shifting priorities and expectations. While not an altogether new phenomenon, the flat nature of many organizations means that pull can come from the top or the bottom, and it’s up to the individual to prioritize one over the other. To evaluate these requests, the FSE stretch across traditional organization boundaries, while not get stretched too thin. They need to be informed about what everyone else is doing without micromanaging them, and not get uncomfortable working in roles unfamiliar to them: product manager, designer, communicator, strategist, advertiser, consultant, technologist, user advocate, marketer… et cetera and so on!",https://medium.com/chris-messina/the-full-stack-employee-ed0db089f0a1,['Chris Messina'],2015-12-08 23:04:18.868000+00:00,"['Future Of Work', 'Digital Nomads', 'Coworking']"
Drone Market Ecosystem map,"After looking into both the VR and IoT space, I wanted to dig in and understand the drone ecosystem and how all of the various players fit together.

Some caveats before we dive into the analysis.

This ecosystem map is not designed to be 100% comprehensive. It’s more to understand all the different spaces within drones.

I am biased towards startups in the space.

If I am missing something tweet me @mccannatron.

This space is developing quickly so take this into consideration.

Observations

Drones are hard to categorize. The drones (hardware) themselves are multi purpose and can be used as a tool for any function. I categorized them based on how each drone company talked about themselves on their home page (see the areas under “commercial”).

It’s interesting to see a few drone companies verticalize and provide the hardware, tools, software, and analysis for a specific market. For example Sky Futures is for oil and gas, Avetics is for film and photography, etc.

It’s interesting to see corporations experiment with drones, most notably in the delivery space. This includes Amazon & Alibaba and also the existing shipping companies: DHL and UPS. One report states that a Chinese Shipping company called SF express is already delivering 500 packages a day via drone. (I can't tell how believable this is).

There is a whole ecosystem developing around the hardware of drones including: insurance, fleet management, marketplaces, data analytics for drone data, etc.

Once the long range programmable drones hit widespread adoption in the consumer and enterprise sector, this could be the first inflection point. For example this drone pictured below made by Airborne Drones can fly up to 90 min, is programmable, has a range up to 12 miles, and can carry 17 pounds.

Company observations

Commercial

If you are thinking about starting or going into the commercial drone market, I would pay attention to all of the various sub industries within the commercial market. I pulled all of these from the websites of all of the commercial drone companies, on the markets they said they served.

Sub industries within Commercial: Agriculture, Construction, Infrastructure, Oil & Gas Utilities, Mining, Inspection, Wildlife, Environment, Humanitarian, Public Safety Mapping, GIS, Surveying, Cinematography, Videography, Advertising, Law Enforcement, and Maritime.

Consumer

From various estimates I have read it looks like DJI has between a 60% and 70% drone marketshare within the consumer space. DJI was reported to have done around $500M in revenue for 2014 and on track to do $1B in sales this year.

EDIT- As many people pointed out DJI drones are widely being used in commercial applications and is the top of the list for FAA exemptions. All that being said I still consider DJI to be a consumer centric company, which many enterprise centric companies can leverage for use in commercial applications.

Marketplace

Insurance/Education

Very interesting to see the big players in insurance — AIG and StateFarm — trying out drone insurance. I’d pay attention to Skyward.

DartDrones is one of the few FAA certified drone flight schools. Depending on the FAA regulations and insurance standards, these types of schools could become important.

Comfortable Recovery from Implant Surgery,"Comfortable Recovery from Implant Surgery

Getting dental implants is one of the most important decisions that one can make to improve the smile. The implants not only make the appearance of the smile more attractive, these titanium tooth roots also restore the healthy function of the smile. Together with the corresponding teeth restorations such as dental crowns or a dental bridge, implants offer ideal solutions for missing teeth problems, bringing back the healthy form and function of the smile.

The implants are placed onto the jawbone using a surgical procedure. The gums are lifted away to expose the jawbone, and the artificial tooth roots are placed directly into the bone to integrate with the surrounding tissue. The implants are given a few months to heal before they can be attached to dental crowns or a fixed dental bridge. As with any surgical procedure, a recovery period is necessary to give the patient sufficient time to get well before undertaking normal physical activities. There are some tips that patients can follow to make the recovery process more comfortable, and much quicker.

The most important thing to do when recovering from an implant placement surgery is to take thing easy, and just relax. The recovery period is the time to get plenty of rest; lying down can help speed up the recovery process, and may help a patient in dealing with the pain and discomfort. All stressful activities and thoughts should be left alone, at least while recovering from the implant placement. Relaxing will also helps manage the bleeding. Patients should avoid physically taxing activities such as lifting of heavy items, or running, as these may start the bleeding in the surgical area once more. The bleeding can be managed by pressing a clean gauze pad into the surgical area and maintaining the firm pressure until the bleeding stops.

Good oral hygiene habits will need to be followed even after surgery to ensure that the teeth, gums, and the implant site stay free from infections & harmful bacteria. The mouth can be cleaned by gently swirling water around; gargling vigorously should be avoided because this can harm the surgical site. Tooth brushing can be done gently, while avoiding the area where the implant was recently placed. Staying nourished is important to boost the body’s strength and natural healing ability, and this can be done even if regular food items cannot be consumed. It is advisable to stick to liquids and soft food items, such as soup, to avoid harming the implant surgery area.

Tips for Upselling Services and Products at a Dental Office,"Tips for Upselling Services and Products at a Dental Office

If you’re a dentist, or if you work in a dental office as an administrator, increasing your revenues in your office is flat out easy to do, but you need to know what to do to make it happen!

Continuing to increase the amount of patients you see on a daily basis is not going to work because there’s only so much time in the day and each patient actually requires a certain amount of time to get the job done. Adding another doctor is not always the best bet because that comes with a long term commitment, and at a high cost.

So here’s how you’re going to increase revenues at your dental office with minimal effort. You need to start upselling add-on services that you offer outside of your normal billable insurance ie: teeth whitening, additional quarterly wellness checkups, custom sports mouthguards, custom nightguards, electric toothbrushes, and so forth.

Even better than billing these premium services on a one-time basis, you need to put them on automatic renewal plans. For example, when a patient signs up for one of your quarterly wellness visit plans, you’ll notify them via their choice of communication, physical mail, text, or email, well in advance of the appointment, and in that follow up reminder communication, you’ll plant the seed for the additional upsell product that you’re going to happen to mention when they’re in for their next visit.

As a dentist, you have access to a lot of different information on your patients, and if you’re not using the public information that you do have to provide upsell products and services that your clients are already buying somewhere else, you’re flat out missing the boat. Ask yourself this, “Why is your client going to Bed Bath and Beyond to buy an electric toothbrush,” when you can actually make the recommendation for them while their at your office, and you can collect the revenue as well.

Now here’s the key that most dental offices make, they don’t setup the sale before the patient arrives, and when the topic of buying an electric toothbrush comes up, the patient feels like their getting the old sell job and they get turned off. You always want to be planting the seed of the sale, before you’re actually trying to sell something. In fact, when you do the setup properly, you’re not even selling, your just providing a value add service to a targeted audience that actually wants want you have to offer.

If your office is hitting people over the head by not setting up the sale ahead of time, stop doing it now, it’s hurting you. What you need to be doing is the following.

Educate Your Patients on what Additional Value Add Services and Products You Provide Educate Your Patients on the Value of the Services and Products that You’re Offering Educate Your Patients on the Value of Buying the Services and Products that Your Offering through You

You notice how all of the above steps are about “educating” your patients, and none of them are directly about selling. The more you can educate your patients, the more money they’re going to spend with you, it’s that simple. Every invoice, whether it’s electronic, or in paper form, needs to have some type of personalized value add educational content on it.

This means that if I’m a man and I come to your office, I’m going to receive educational content on the invoice that I receive that’s relevant to me, such as, what men my age typically see in regards to their dental health, and the same goes for any woman coming to your office.

Here’s another great upsell opportunity, how about asking your patients if they play any sports, and if they do, what sport it is, and when their season typically starts. Once you have this information, put a tag ie: football, soccer, lacrosse, or any other sports, in your CRM (customer relationship management) system, and then a few months before the sport starts, send the patient out an email on the value of having a custom mouthguard made to protect them while they’re playing their specific sport.

Boom, there you have it, you set up the patient for a sale, by sending out helpful, valuable, and useful information about what’s going to help keep their teeth in their mouth while they’re playing sports. Not only that, but because you new what time of year the sport started, you’re were able to send the information out at the perfect time!

Lastly, any paper documents that you currently use to collect information from clients ie: address, name, email, insurance, family members, emergency contacts, immediately needs to be changed into an electronic searchable form. This means that whenever you want to, you can run a report and sort your patients by different search criteria. Remember, the more you can personalize your communications, the more you’re going to sell, so this is another vital piece of the puzzle.

Listen, upselling services at your dental office will work, you just need to learn what to do, and how to do it. And if you don’t know how to upsell, or you don’t have to time or resources to do it yourself, our team at MyVirtualSalesForce has the perfect “do everything for you” solution. Stop messing around, and start increasing your revenues today.

What are the Options to Fill Gaps in your Teeth?,"According to invisalign dentist Fremont ,Many people have gaps in their teeth. Some people choose to deal with having gaps in their teeth, while others prefer having those gaps filled in. While the best course of action may be leaving the gaps alone, you may want to visit your local dentist for a professional opinion. Gaps aren’t like missing teeth but they may bother you enough to visit a dentist who can help. Closing your teeth gaps can help with self-confidence and make one feel more attractive. There are several options for closing teeth gaps.

Gaps in your smile may be due to missing teeth or a result of two adult teeth that aren’t aligned. The most common option and less costly for replacing a missing tooth is a removable partial denture. This type of partial is commonly made from chrome cobalt and acrylic.Flexi partial dentures are gaining popularity due to the comfort of aesthetics. Partials are easy and ideal if you need several teeth that need replacing. The only downfall is trying to get used to wearing metal or plastic in your mouth.

Another option for replacing a missing tooth is referred to as a “fixed denture”. The down side for this procedure is the cost. This method is more expensive and requires a few visits to complete. A drawback is that the healthy teeth on either side of the missing tooth require expansive removal of tooth tissue with a dental drill so a mold can be created. The mold is delivered to a dental lab and a dental bridge is fabricated of porcelain and gold. Most people seem pleased with the results and there’s a lifespan of anywhere from 5–10 years.

Dental implants are another option. A dental implant is made from titanium, in the shape of a root. This is screwed into the bone, where it incorporates into it like a root. Implants can be used to support a crown, a bridge or a denture. Implants may also be used in orthodontic treatment. If a bridge cannot be used, dental implants are a good choice. Dental implants are costly and require many visits to the dentist. The pros: implants feel natural and there’s no preparation time involved.

For a less intrusive bridge, the Maryland Bridge isn’t as costly and there’s less removal of tooth tissue. This means less damage to the surrounding teeth. This procedure is often used for replacing a single tooth. This type of bridge is comprised of a porcelain crown bonded to a metal framework and glued with an adhesive resin to the back of the teeth on either side of the missing tooth.",https://medium.com/@eastbaydental.seo/what-are-the-options-to-fill-gaps-in-your-teeth-491caa0af262,['East Bay Dental'],2015-12-16 13:18:08.990000+00:00,['Dentistry']
3 Tips for a Pain-Free Visit to Your Dentist,"3 Tips for a Pain-Free Visit to Your Dentist

Dental anxiety or fear can keep you from having strong, healthy teeth. While you may follow a proper hygiene routinely, from brushing to flossing to eating the right foods, a visit to the dentist is still a crucial part of maintaining oral health. Also, you might encounter situations that will require treatment from a dentist.

It is no longer necessary to avoid the dental clinic because of your anxieties or fears. With advances in dental technology and an increased understanding of dental phobia, you can get a checkup or treatment and feel relaxed throughout your time in the clinic.

Here are three tips for a pain-free experience at the dentist.

1. Find a dentist that suits you.

WebMD shares that 66 percent of those who have dental phobia have it because of a bad visit to the dentist. So if your fears or anxieties stem from an unpleasant dental appointment, then find a dentist that suits you. You need to feel comfortable as well as trust your dentist in order to relax during a visit.

Get a shortlist of ideal Boise dentists. Then go for an initial consultation to get a feel for their chairside manner.

2. Use modern dentistry to your advantage.

Choose a sedation dentist. Sedation dentistry uses medication, dispensed in different methods, to calm you during any procedure. Your dentist may give you a pill to take an hour or so before the procedure, i.e., oral sedation; your dentist could also use inhaled sedation, so you get nitrous oxygen, or your dentist could use IV sedation, so you get the medication intravenously.

You’ll also still get local anesthesia so you will feel nothing when you’re getting a root canal or getting porcelain crowns. Patients like you will feel completely relaxed and calm no matter what sedation method is used.

3. Practice relaxation techniques every day.

Daily meditation or yoga may help you feel calmer each time you have to go to the dentist. Yes, even when you’ve chosen a dentist you’re comfortable with and sedation dentistry is involved, you may still feel just a little apprehensive about getting a tooth extracted or undergoing dental restoration.

It’s understandable to feel anxious about any kind of dental treatment. But at some point, you need to take control and manage your emotions. Practicing relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga could help you feel calmer.

You no longer have to stay away from the dentist, due to fear or anxiety. With sedation dentistry, you can achieve the best dental care possible — and feel absolutely relaxed.",https://medium.com/@charissebarlow/3-tips-for-a-pain-free-visit-to-your-dentist-a36b78ba9145,['Charisse Barlow'],2015-12-21 15:42:22.129000+00:00,"['Dentistry', 'Dental Treatment', 'Relaxation']"
Services Offered By a Cosmetic Dentist — Dubai Practitioners Provide an Overview,"Services Offered By a Cosmetic Dentist — Dubai Practitioners Provide an Overview

Your teeth have two primary functions: a practical and an aesthetic function. Apart from aiding in the digestion of food, your teeth also contribute to your looks and your confidence.

A cosmetic dentist, Dubai locals ought to know, focuses on services that remedy problems related to aesthetics. Among the most common services rendered by these specialists are teeth whitening, veneers, teeth straightening, crowns, bridges and fillings. Here’s a brief overview of these services.

Teeth whitening

Over time, a person’s teeth lose their luster. Staining may come as a result of consumption of certain food and drinks or from smoking. Others are predisposed to have yellower teeth because of their genetics.

Cosmetic dentists can restore the luster of teeth through the use of different techniques like lasers and whitening gels.

Veneers

For dental problems like crowding of teeth, broken teeth, stained teeth, gaps between teeth and poorly shaped teeth, your cosmetic dentist may recommend the use of veneers.

Veneers can be used to modify different aspects of the teeth including their shape, length and width. Veneers are made out of thin slices of porcelain that are shaped and colored to match the patient’s existing teeth. The veneer is attached to the surface of the teeth using a bonding agent. The treatment also requires drilling to shape the veneers.

Teeth straightening

For teeth that are crooked, crowded or tilted, your cosmetic dentist may recommend teeth straightening. Teeth straightening can be classified either as cosmetic or orthodontics.

With the former, the dentist uses an electrosurge unit to remove portions of the gum. This allows him to reshape it to suit the veneers which are bonded to the front surface of the teeth. Orthodontics involves the use of either metal braces or aligners.

Dental crowns

Also known as caps, dental crowns are used for chipped teeth or to replace broken teeth.

The treatment starts with the dentist taking an impression of the tooth. Afterwards, the crown is fabricated in a laboratory. The tooth will be cut down to make room for the crown which will be cemented on the tooth.

Bridges

Bridges are used to close in gaps left by missing teeth. The bridge is attached to both ends of the gap using cement. Afterwards, three crowns made out of porcelain are attached to this bridge by drilling. The middle crown is solid and mimics the function of natural teeth. The other two are hollow.

12 Reasons to Take Better Care of Your Teeth This Holiday Season,"12 Reasons to Take Better Care of Your Teeth This Holiday Season

The holidays are upon us and most of us are going to temporarily forget about eating healthy because it’s really just an impossible task to do when you’re going from one party to another. Forget about a healthy diet…check!

However, when it comes to oral health, it’s imperative to be more mindful of it this holiday season. Why? My family dentist rounded up 12 reasons in a poster plastered on the wall of her clinic’s waiting room that I’m sharing below, as how I remember them.

#1 Baked goods are responsible for build-up that leads to hardened plaque. Plaque is not only unsightly but it causes bad breath, too.

#2 You’ll be loading up on more sweets this season — you have Christmas candies, chocolates, hot cocoa and other sweet treats which release acids that can make your teeth sensitive and prone to wear.

#3 Carbonated beverages, like spritzers, sparkling cider, et cetera, can weaken your teeth’s enamel.

#4 If you’re an adult, you’ll be pounding wine, which can leave stains on your teeth. In the words of Amy Schumer, it’s “True Blood” mouth for red wine drinkers. You don’t want your pricey teeth whitening sessions to go to waste, right?

#5 You’ll be eating non-stop and you’re going to be less inclined to brush after meals because there really is no clear distinction of when a meal has ended during the holidays.

#6 The cold temperatures will arrest your body’s immune system and will make you susceptible to coughs and colds. One good way of preventing that from happening is by brushing more frequently and reducing bacteria in the body.

#7 Colder air can make your teeth quite sensitive. You may want to try desensitizing toothpaste to reduce the discomfort.

#8 There’ll be a lot of picture-taking at parties. You’ll be smiling a lot and you need to make sure your teeth look nice for those pictures that will be shared in various social media sites.

#9 It’s the season for smiles — bring warmth to other people by smiling more often and making your smile as bright as the Christmas star.

#10 It’s the season for socialization (you can be meeting important people for the first time or reuniting with those you haven’t seen in an incredibly long time) and making a good impression is a must; therefore, be sure to have clean teeth and fresh breath.

#11 You want to welcome the New Year with good oral habits.

#12 Because your dentist said so.

why people need good dental care …,"why people need good dental care …

Today mostly it happens that Not everyone goes to the dentist like they should, and many children and families haven’t seen a dentist in years, which can lead to significant health issues,No doubt.According to the National Academies, millions of Americans are not receiving needed dental care services because of “persistent and systemic” environment that limit their access to oral health care.

Also according to a Report..” In 2008, 4.6 million children did not obtain needed dental care because their families could not afford it. And in 2006, only 38 percent of retirees had dental coverage, a benefit not covered by Medicare”.

Negligence on oral health care has serious issues, the report says, including increased risk of respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, as well as inappropriate use of hospital emergency departments for preventable dental diseases. The report offers a vision of oral health care in which prevention of oral diseases and promotion of oral health are a priority and a facet of overall health.

Want to share some tips for Getting Your Smile in Good Shape:

- To Prevent Oral disease — When you have your dental cleaning, your dentist is also screening you for oral cancer, which is highly curable if diagnosed early.

- To Prevent Gum Disease — Gum disease is an infection in the gum tissues and bone that keep your teeth in place and is one of the leading causes of adult tooth loss.

- To Have a White, Bright Smile — Your dental hygienist can remove most tobacco, coffee and tea stains. During your cleaning, your hygienist will also polish your teeth to a beautiful shine.

- To Prevent Bad Breath — Dental studies show that about 85 percent of people with persistent bad breath, also known as halitosis, have a dental problem that is to blame.

A great smile can opens more doors for you,but it also helps keep you healthy once you get inside. Preventive dental work is essential for your health, and your teeth and gums will thank you for it over and over. Make the most of your smile.

"Does tooth brushing prevent dental decay? The answer might surprise you. — Dr. Kris Roling, CEO Virtual Dontics. Live, Online Continuing Dental Education.","As a dentist, I was trained to advise my patients on “good” oral hygiene practice to prevent tooth decay. Brush twice a day, floss daily, use a fluoride toothpaste, and see your dentist every six months for a checkup and cleaning. We tell our patients, if you do these things, “chances” are you won’t get a cavity. Recently there has been discussion amongst the public health dentistry world, “Does brushing your teeth really prevent dental decay?” Honestly, dentists don’t know this for sure. Yes, you read this correctly. Evidence Based Dentistry does not support the prevailing thought among dentists that brushing your teeth prevents dental cavities. If you are a dentist or a dental hygienist, raise your hand if you have witnessed a patient who has done everything right and still developed a cavity. What have we told this patient? Looks like you missed a spot with your toothbrush? Right? The fact is, there are areas of the tooth that a brush cannot reach, including pits and fissures. So why do some folks develop a cavity, and others don’t? Why are the poor twice as likely to be afflicted by dental decay? Why is there an assumption among dentists and the public, that poor people don’t brush their teeth, creating a greater prevalence of disease? Isn’t this a little like the notion of using leeches for 2000 years in the ancient practice of bloodletting? Sometimes the disease improved, and we credited the leeches, and sometimes the patient’s condition worsened. The tooth brush companies have made billions on the notion of creating a “better mousetrap” and while they may reduce plaque, the focus of a toothbrush as the silver bullet to eradicate an epidemic, is questionable, especially when EBD suggests that the plaque removed may be transient. Although CAMBRA was developed to assess risk of developing disease and assign appropriate treatment, what about other non-dental circumstances that have little to do with brushing and flossing that seem to drive this silent epidemic? Risk factors include poverty, not graduating from high school, low socioeconomic status, being part of an ethnic minority group, being developmentally disabled, geriatric, recent immigrants, tobacco users, and people infected with HIV/AIDS.

In my practice, I treat the poor. Historically, dentistry’s approach in treating the socioeconomically disadvantaged is to give them a free toothbrush and advise them that their catastrophic dental disease is a result of their own behavior, they just aren’t brushing to our (dentist’s) satisfaction. Not too long ago, I had a dentist tell me that they didn’t “buy the whole ‘poor’ thing”, and further stated, “We give them a toothbrush, it’s up to them to use it.” Now that dental decay is an epidemic of the poor, can we say this approach is working? We do know that plaque left on teeth may cause a breakdown in the enamel leading to decay. Tooth brushing can remove plaque, so it stands to reason this should prevent cavities, right? The answer is not necessarily, so what are we overlooking? The body’s reaction to stress and the environment. Like any chronic disease, dental decay is exacerbated by stress in the form of living in poverty, poor nutritional status, illness, isolation and disconnection from community. Studies measured cortisol levels as an indicator of stress in children and caries level. Children with higher levels of cortisol levels experienced more decay. Recently, research pointed the exposure to second hand cigarette smoke as an increased risk factor in developing caries in young children.

So do we stop giving away the free tooth brushes?

No. Although not evidence based, tooth brushing is shown to reduce plaque levels, especially in conjunction with fluoridated toothpaste. More evidence based practice must be introduced. The dental and medical profession however, must approach dental decay as a public health epidemic of the poor. Rather than focusing on the best way to brush, public health policy should be developed to address the inequity of access to care, healthy communities and the reduction of poverty �h��_(�",https://medium.com/@virtualdontics/does-tooth-brushing-prevent-dental-decay-2959a9096275,['Virtual Dontics'],2015-12-16 05:24:17.181000+00:00,"['Dental Care', 'Dentistry', 'Dental Hygiene']"

Soft drinks causes Dental Erosion

Overview: Dental erosion also called as Acid erosion is defined as the loss of tooth structure due to acid attack and not of bacterial origin. Tooth eroding occurs due to acids from the foods we eat, drink or from the stomach acids. These acids can dissolve the crystals that make up the teeth and leads to the loss of the tooth surface. It softens the tooth surface and makes it to wear away easily by the process of abrasion or tooth grinding.

Causes of Dental Erosion: The most common cause of erosion is due to consuming foods and drinks with a pH less than 5.5. Enamel will be eroded first followed by dentin if unchecked. The affected area will be very sensitive to hot and cold drinks. Diets, sodas, sports drinks, flavored fizzy waters, Fruit juices such as orange juice and carbonated drinks are the main culprits for dental erosion. Saliva has the ability to restore the natural balance within the mouth and enough time should be given to repair itself, otherwise the surface of the teeth is worn away.

Results from participants: A study was conducted among the individuals to see how the soft drinks cause dental erosion. 3773 participants were included in the study and their results shows, 79% of the participants had dental erosion, 64% of the individuals had mild tooth wear, moderate tooth wear was seen in 10% of the individuals and 5% of the people have the signs of severe tooth wear. Individuals who consumed more fruit juices and soft drinks each day resulted in mild and severe tooth wear than the other group individuals.

Participants with lower tooth wear found that, milk as a popular drink among them than the fruit juice or soda. The result also shows that men are more susceptible to tooth erosion than the women and also among the participants the severity of the tooth erosion increases as the age increases. Researchers also say that fruit juices are nutritious for health, but the presence of sugar and acid content in that causes severe dental erosion if consumed daily.

Water and milk are the safest choice as it is good for oral health as well as for overall wellness. Oral health plays a major role in one’s life so it is good to limit the intake of sugar level or sugary beverages in order to keep maintain our health. More than 6 spoons of sugars are present in the sodas and fruit juices which is more than the recommended doses. This high presence of sugar causes severe dental erosion.

Care your teeth: Oral health is the key thing to be maintained. Treatment is not always required for dental erosion. Doctor’s advice and regular checkups can keep an eye on the issue and protected from the severe dental problems. Severe damage to the teeth can cause the treatment very expensive. In order to maintain an oral and overall health every one of us should maintain health in a proper way as to avoid dental problems. Teeth are more precious than diamond hence maintaining a good oral hygiene is very crucial in order to keep our body healthy.

Summary: Dental erosion is very commonly seen in the present generation. This is due to the consumption of most soft drinks like fruit juices and sodas each day. A study was conducted among 3773 participants, which show the majority of the participants faced dental erosion due to the intake of juices and sodas which have a high concentration of sugar and acids. Dental erosion can be reduced with proper health and oral care. or More Information:",https://medium.com/@richalandy/international-journal-of-dentistry-oral-health-disorders-therapy-high-impact-articles-soj-d27c5d24ae3c,['Richal Andy'],2015-12-26 15:52:28.322000+00:00,"['Dentistry', 'Dental Care']"
Tooth Sensitivity Causes,"Tooth Sensitivity Causes

Tooth sensitivity leads to a great deal of discomfort, and can take away the pleasure of enjoying meal times. Those who suffer from sensitive teeth are aware that a single, sharp jolt of pain — triggered by cold or hot food — can be enough to destroy the whole dining experience. This painful response is caused by the teeth being exposed to extreme changes in temperature, such as eating or drinking something extremely hot or when a frozen item is consumed. When the sensitive inner parts of the tooth — such as the dentine and the roots — are exposed due to worn enamel, even the slightest change in temperature can trigger a sharp jolt of pain. Determining the causes of teeth sensitivity can help in the proper management of this problem, so that painful episodes can be avoided or at least decreased in frequency.

Teeth grinding can wear down the tooth enamel, which is the protective layer of the teeth. When the enamel is worn away, the sensitive inner portions of the teeth are exposed and easily react with sudden temperature changes. Another reason why the enamel is worn away prematurely is because of heavy consumption of acidic food and beverages. The high acidity works in slowly dissolving the enamel so that the inner sensitive parts become exposed. The teeth enamel can also get thinner, or become worn down, due to forceful tooth brushing. Brushing the teeth using vigorous, forceful strokes can eventually wear away the tooth enamel, and may even cause the gums to recede. When the gums recede, the roots of the teeth become exposed and will cause teeth sensitivity as well.

Improper oral hygiene can also contribute to the development of teeth sensitivity problems. Healthy oral hygiene habits, such as regular tooth brushing and regular visits to the dentist, are essential in ensuring that harmful plaque buildup does not occur. If these healthy habits are not followed, food debris can react with harmful bacteria and cause the buildup of plaque. Plaque buildup in between the teeth and the gum line can cause tooth decay and gum recession — and both can cause sensitive teeth problems. Damaged teeth are also highly susceptible to sensitivity issues. This is because when the enamel is damaged, the protective layer of the tooth is worn away to expose the sensitive tooth roots and dentine inside. Cracked, chipped, or decayed teeth will experience sudden painful jolts when something extremely hot or cold is consumed.

How to keep your mouth health,"The health of your mouth and teeth are conducive to your overall health. Taking care of your mouth can prevent serious health problems down the road as you get older. The first step to a healthy mouth is brush and floss daily and visit your dentist regularly.

According to the Fremont cosmetic dentist a healthy mouth begins with the first set of teeth. Caring for your baby’s teeth from the onset will determine the health of his/her mouth. As a general rule it is recommended not to let your baby go to sleep with a bottle in his/her mouth. The milk or juice your baby is drinking van lead to tooth decay. From the very first tooth begin brushing with a soft toothbrush. If your baby is under the age of 2 it is recommended not to use toothpaste. Instead you can brush using water. The American Dental Association recommends that children see their dentist beginning at 1 year of age. Children’s dentistry is important for the overall health of your child.

Moving into the teens means flossing teeth at least once a day and brushing twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste. A visit to the dentist every 6 months is recommended. Smoking or chewing tobacco can stain your teeth and cause cancer.

As adulthood approaches its still as important now more than ever to continue the practice of healthy oral habits. Tooth care now means looking for signs of irritated gums, mouth sores, and other changes. Even though you may be flossing regularly and brushing twice a day other problems may arise as you begin to age. If you have cosmetic concerns you can look into Cosmetic Dentistry in Fremont.

Cleansing Tooth & Gum Brush,"Cleansing Tooth & Gum Brush

Currently, many Canadians and Americans battle with gum erosion and recession. After many years of harsh and excessive brushing, your gums begin to wear away and recede. This is called gum recession. As increasing numbers of gum tissue wears away, more of the tooth is exposed prior to the tooth root and nerves start becoming exposed causing sensitivity and consequently pain. Gum bleeding is the one other results of gum recession. Other than excessive tooth brushing, plaque buildup and genetics are other reasons for gum recession and sensitive gums.

Eat Your Way to Good Teeth,"Eat Your Way to Good Teeth

Just as you’ll find certain foods damaging to your teeth, so will you find specific foods beneficial to your teeth. These types of foods promote oral health and make your pearly whites look like you’re meant for Hollywood’s big screen. So what should you stock up on to keep your teeth in “good shape?”

Chew on These

Fruits

The best fruits for your teeth include cranberries, raisins, and apples (of course!). Cranberries, according to a study published in the Caries Journal, lower the risk for cavities. Thanks to the presence of polyphenols, cranberries prevent plaque from fixing to your teeth by slowing down bacteria growth. Raisins, meanwhile, contain phytochemicals. Phytochemicals destroy cavity-causing plaque bacteria.

Apples, on the other hand, can cleanse and brighten your teeth. This is attributed to the mild acidic nature of the fruit that acts as an astringent for your pearly whites. Also, apples are pretty crunchy, which lead to a whole lot of chewing. Chewing can disturb dental plaque, which means the insidious “beasts” don’t stick around, causing your teeth harm.

Cheese

Yum. Cheese, it turns out, is not just delectable to your tummy but valuable for your teeth, too. A study published in General Dentistry reveals that cheese can prevent cavities. The delightful dairy product increases pH levels in the mouth; higher pH levels lower the chance of getting cavities.

Leafy Green Vegetables

Kale and spinach promote good oral health because they contain calcium and folic acid. Calcium builds your teeth’s enamel while folic acid can treat gum disease, particularly with pregnant women. You can eat them in stir fries and salads, or drink them up in smoothies for a power breakfast or pre-workout beverage.

Almonds

These super tasty nuts are high in protein and low in sugar. So you will definitely want to have them in your “dental diet.” Instead of snacking on salty chips or deadly sweet pastries, try almonds.

Drink Up!

Tea

Like cranberries, tea contains polyphenols. But don’t just drink any old tea. Choose black and green teas. A study from the University of Illinois discovered that people who rinsed with black tea every day had less plaque buildup than people who rinsed only with water. The Journal of Dental Research also adds that black tea can fight halitosis.

Milk

If you listened to your mom about drinking milk, then you probably have fantastic teeth now. The American Dental Association shares that drinking a glass of milk daily can lower levels of acid, which is good for your teeth.",https://medium.com/@charissebarlow/eat-your-way-to-good-teeth-b560893723af,['Charisse Barlow'],2015-12-21 15:45:09.820000+00:00,"['Health', 'Dentistry']"
The New-Old Organizing Tool Perfect for Hillary Supporters,"The New-Old Organizing Tool Perfect for Hillary Supporters

In recent campaigns, whether it’s a congressional campaign or presidential campaign, the fundamentals of voter contact are phoning and canvassing. It’s how I began as a volunteer (running a volunteer phone bank) and it’s what we measure in our contacts with voters leading up to elections. Voter contact is important. And, yet, every campaign is different and requires adaptation to meet the unique nature of each campaign. This year, as a supporter of Hillary Clinton, in addition to phoning for voter contact, I’ve been experimenting with hosting house parties — purposeful house parties — for Hillary, which leads me to say,

“If you support Hillary Clinton for President, then start hosting house parties.”

Last June I had the opportunity to hear a presentation by Stephanie Schriock of EMILY’s List, where she shared polling data on voter knowledge of Hillary. Most voters know who Hillary Clinton is and so she has very high name id. Surprisingly very few voters know what she’s done. We’re talking people who only think of her as the former First Lady, who don’t know about her full career as an attorney, child advocate, Children’s Defense Fund employee, US Senator from New York, and even as the Secretary of State in President Obama’s Cabinet.

I might have been skeptical of this statement had I not encountered this very phenomena at the 2008 caucuses. At my precinct caucus in 2008 a woman who was supporting then Senator Obama told me that, “being First Lady doesn’t qualify you to be President.” I recall my brain flashing to counter arguments like she’s been a senator longer than Barack Obama has been, and then flashed to the reality that this woman is not going to change her mind and I shouldn’t waste the short time we have to negotiate with someone who is already decided. That memory validated in a very personal way what Stephanie was telling us statistically. People need to know more about Hillary’s life experiences and that type of engagement takes more time than a phone call or talking with someone at their front door.

That was when I decided to host a house party for others who are supporting or interested in supporting Hillary Clinton. At the first house party in July my goal was to help educate people on Hillary’s bio, just the facts of who she is and what she has done. Ironically, to do so, I ended up expanding my knowledge of Hillary Clinton as well. (And here I thought I knew all about her.)

A former campaign colleague on another presidential caucus campaign created an episode of Jeopardy! where the topic was our candidate and facts about his career. It was fun and effective. As a campaign manager for congressional candidates, I used this and other games to help the campaign staff learn the information we needed to know.

Playing a fun game is a much better way to remember the information than reading a flat bio or listening to someone else read it.

For the July Hillary house party, I worked with another supporter to create the questions for the Jeopardy! board with the topic, Hillary Clinton. I was nervous about it because it’s one thing to tell people you’re working with that they “get” to play this game, and another thing to tell invited guests. Fortunately, they were all open to it. We formed two teams and offered old campaign pins as prizes. Everyone was engaged and brought their competitive spirit to the rounds. One person commented on leaving, “This is the first time I’ve actually learned something at a campaign house party.”

Since then, I’ve held a house party every month, with different people attending. September was another round of Jeopardy! with different categories, including adding information about the many different plans Hillary had rolled out during the summer months. Based upon questions from the participants, October was loosely styled like a trivia game, where the questions required higher level thinking skills and were focused on her policy plans.

November was the first of a series on caucus strategies, with a nod to the tradition from rural caucuses of a chili potluck. Unlike other caucus trainings, this one focused on reading the room, what to think about and how to use the information in front of you to inform the conversations with others in ways that will most help Hillary.

More importantly, when I’m calling Democrats in my precinct, I always tell them about some of the things going on in our own neighborhood and invite them to come to the next house party. It’s a great way to engage people in a conversation and to let them know that it’s happening here in their neighborhood. (And, yes, I do leave messages with my phone number and information about the next house party if no one answers the phone.)

If someone had told me a year ago that doing this would be helpful to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, I would have laughed and scoffed and probably said something like, “House parties are for fundraising, not for organizing.” Well, things change and hosting a house party for Hillary supporters is a good thing to do.

As Hillary supporters, we’re not just working to win the Iowa Caucuses or to secure the nomination, we want to see Hillary Clinton as our next president. Voters make their decisions on whom to support based on a variety of factors, including what influential friends know about a candidate. You, dear reader, can be that influential friend by hosting a house party. You’ll have fun and you’ll help Hillary.

As public and vocal supporters, we need to be well informed about our candidate and we need to help inform others. And we need to be open to doing what it takes to help others share our understanding of Hillary.

A Recap on the Democratic Debate,"The second Democratic debate, hosted by CBS News, proved fast-paced driven by productive, tough questioning toward the three Democratic candidates: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, and former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley.

After the tragic Paris attacks the prior evening, CBS News understandably made national security and foreign policy a top priority for the first part of the debate. The evening began on a somber note, with the candidates and lead moderator John Dickerson expressing their condolences through a moment of silence.

Soon after, the candidates ran head first into their first disagreement: terrorism and ISIS. Sanders felt that then New York Senator Hillary Clinton’s 2002 vote for the Iraq Invasion was responsible for Iraq and the Middle East’s situation with ISIS. However, Clinton blames the disbandment of the Iraqi army and said ISIS cannot be “contained,” but rather have to be “defeated.”

In the mix of this, Sanders supports his claim that climate change is the greatest threat toward national security and says that it directly relates to terrorism.

O’Malley is asked if he, having no foreign relation experience, could handle such a dangerous world. He quickly responses by attacking Clinton for the world being dangerous, although he didn’t mention her name (his response also ignores the question).

Either way, all of the candidates were pivotal on using radical “jihadists” rather than the term “radical Islam,” before turning to refugees. O’Malley pointed out he was the first candidate on the stage to call for the United States to take in 65,000 Syrian refugees. Clinton, who also supports the U.S. taking in refugees, says that all refugees should be vetted and screened.

The debate then moves to various different directions including Wall Street, Clinton’s millions of dollars worth of speeches and e-mail use, the corrupt finance system, health care, and education.

In summary, Clinton discusses how she will pay for family paid leave and health care breaks. She mentions taxing the wealthy more and closing corporation loopholes and deductions as a few strategies. O’Malley mentions that his state raised sales tax to get stuff done and Sanders reiterates that large corporations and the wealthy will pay their fair share in order for them to pay for his presidential plans.

While Sanders aspires to “scrap” Obamacare and move to a single-payer system, Clinton states that it is unrealistic. Instead, she feels that the focus should be on preserving the Affordable Care Act and working to improve it.

On the topic of guns, O’Malley talks about what he did in Baltimore to make it safer, while Clinton hit Sanders on his support of a 2005 bill that granted immunity to gun manufacturers. A short-lived cat fight ensues with O’Malley accusing Clinton of taking “three sides” on the gun debate.

In my opinion, Sanders improved since his last debate, answering questions far more effectively and with greater detail this time around. However, voters are looking for policy specifics and he simply couldn’t provide details for his makeover on healthcare and college.

As someone who openly endorses Clinton, I feel that her supporters got what can be described as a win. In response to tough questions, she remained calm with her answers and provided an effective rebuttal when attacked. She was also able to cite her foreign policy experience when topics of terrorism and national security came up.

Overall, the debate proves how productive debates can be and with that, I look forward to many more so Americans can see discussions and branch out to conversations about the candidate that best fits their vision.

"Win or Lose, Bernie Will Benefit the Most From Last Night’s Debate","Win or Lose, Bernie Will Benefit the Most From Last Night’s Debate

Via Five Thirty Eight

If you vote Democrat and your name is not Joe Biden, chances are good that you went to bed happy after CNN’s Democratic debate last night.

That’s because unlike the Thunder Dome-style Republican debates, there were no clear-cut eviscerations like one could expect from any debate in which Donald Trump is involved.

So then why did almost every headline across the Internet this morning read that Hillary Clinton was the obvious winner of last night’s Democratic debate?

Surely, CNN, Time and Slate saw their own polls that showed views siding with Bernie Sanders by a long shot … Well, except maybe CNN who deleted their poll in the morning, and replaced it with a story titled, “Hillary Clinton’s Big Night on the Debate Stage.”

Interestingly, that headline doesn’t quite match up with their post debate coverage, which showed CNN’s Facebook survey and focus group all considering Bernie Sanders the sure debate winner.

Let’s be clear: Hillary Clinton had a great night — she nailed most of her obvious talking points, she wasn’t attacked too harshly by any candidate — or arguably even Anderson Cooper — and like a well trained politician, she navigated curveballs acceptably.

But one thing she didn’t do, which in the long run she desperately needs to do, is give voters a reason to vote for her that they don’t already have.

Voters going into last night’s debate with their minds made up, were not going to be swayed — be they Bernie fans, or Hillary fans.

But here is Hillary’s problem: she’s the establishment. In any other cycle that would be fine, but if her waning poll numbers are indicative of anything, it shows that a portion of her voters are up for grabs. Sanders doesn’t have that problem.

In the Long Run, Bernie Sanders Won the First Democratic Debate

For many voters, Bernie Sanders is a hard sell; and rightly so. But his fiery rhetoric is captivating to those who can identify with his message. Look no further than the record setting crowds at his rallies, or the impressive amount of small dollar donors his campaign drew in just a few months. Its safe to say that when you go Bernie, you don’t go back.

And debates have consequences that go far beyond stage time, and for Bernie Sanders, there’s no where to go but up. Here is why Bernie Sanders won the first Democratic debate:

1. He got the quote of the night.

By now you have probably heard that Bernie Sanders is “sick of hearing about your damn emails” Hillary Clinton. That line was a gift to Hillary , but Sanders will surely reap the benefits. Why? Because it speaks directly to who he is as a candidate: No B/S —2016 voters like that.

2. In the first 24 hours after the debate, his campaign raised $2 million.

That goes to show that he inspired people. Many progressives have been living in a Bernie-bubble the last few months, but it is important to remember that many still don’t know who he is, or what he is about — just that he is a challenger to Hillary Clinton. But last night was his first real shot at captivating a national audience; and if money is any indicator, he struck a chord.

3. He won the internet vote.

Despite what Donald Trump said, any Google analytics, or Twitter trend, or Facebook trend, showed Bernie Sanders was creating the most online buzz. Oh not to mention, the word “socialism” gained some traction on Google too… most just wanted to know what it meant.

4. He got people excited.

CNN’s post debate focus group was full of voters who loved Bernie’s performance. People who were previously ready for Hillary, were fired up by Bernie Sanders, and switched sides. One voter even said he was convinced the country would be a little better off with a dash of Socialism.

So does that speak for the rest of Democratic voters? See sections 1–3.

So Where Does Bernie Go From Here?

All this good news for Sanders fans shouldn’t amount to more than just that — good news. Sanders still has an uphill battle ahead of him, wether the media is on his side or not. Last night was an overall win for him, but he still fumbles a bit on issues of gun control, and the scarlet “S” pinned to his jacket is still seen as a general election death sentence.

But as far as the first debate goes: hate it or love it Hillary, but last night the underdog was on top.",https://medium.com/@returnofthedok/win-or-lose-bernie-will-benefit-the-most-from-last-night-s-debate-9870b8e26cb1,['Andrew Cullen'],2015-10-28 07:17:31.968000+00:00,"['Politics', 'Bernie Sanders', 'Hillary Clinton']"
Hillary Clinton Thinks You Are Very Dumb,"Last night, Bernie Sanders asked why Hillary Clinton’s foremost campaign donors have been Wall Street banks. I’ve linked a video of the exchange below, but here’s a transcript of what he said:

I have never heard a candidate — never — who has received yuuuge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military-industrial complex, not one candidate says, “Oh, this campaign contribution will not influence me. I’m gonna be independent.” Well, why do they make millions of dollars in campaign contributions? They expect to get something, everybody knows that. Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate. We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, thirty bucks apiece. That’s who I’m indebted to.

This is a good question! Generally speaking, people will contribute to political campaigns they support. Banks enjoy being profitable. By extension, they will thus support policies (and, necessarily, politicians) that will bolster their bottom lines. So, it poses the question: When four of Hillary’s top five campaign donors are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley, who’s being played a fool? Presumably, it’s not the very wealthy people whose entire careers revolve around buying things to advance their own self interest, so, Sanders is saying, perhaps it’s the populace at large for believing Hillary when she suddenly professes a new love for regulating banks.

Here is Mrs. Clinton’s response:

He has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity, let’s be frank here. You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small, and I’m very proud that, for the first time, a majority of my donors are women — 60 percent of them. [Applause.] I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11, when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan, where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild, that was good for New York, it was good for the economy, and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country. [Applause]

Let’s be totally clear, here: Hillary Clinton only felt comfortable offering that bucket of word-turds as an answer because she thinks you are very stupid. She thinks you are an easily-distracted child, and she does not respect you.

I think it’s fine that women are donating to Hillary’s campaign! I’d rather introduce publicly-funded elections, but if we’re going to have a broken system, we might as well have gender parity. (We do it with overpolicing and CEOs, as well. This is liberalism in 2015, refusing to tackle the roots of problems like your favorite sportsmen refuse to tackle their rivals’ quarterback.)

But what in the world does any of that have to do with Wall Street? If I ran for President and took money from Satan, aka The Actual Devil, could I say, “Well, a majority of my contributions are from people who are not the Dark Lord, Harbinger of the Absolute Nothing, Prince Of All That Is Ghoulish, so, never mind?” Of course not. Why is everyone clapping?

Emboldened, Hillary seized the opportunity to make a cartoon a reality in a way that even Rudi “9/11” Giuliani would balk at. I get that it’s a Presidential debate, so we’ll have to be reminded of how you were in charge during what is possibly the worst day in our nation’s history — why is this a thing politicians keep doing, by the way? I don’t remind everyone of the time I managed a McDonald’s that burst into flames — but my god, you were asked about campaign contributions. What does this have to do with 9/11? What is the causal relationship here?

WHY IS EVERYONE CLAPPING?

It’s because she’s right. We are easily-distracted children, and we will get the President we deserve.

CONGRESSMAN MO BROOKS’ SPECIOUS ARGUMENTS FOR IMPEACHING HILARY CLINTON SHOULD SHE BE ELECTED…,"CONGRESSMAN MO BROOKS’ SPECIOUS ARGUMENTS FOR IMPEACHING HILARY CLINTON SHOULD SHE BE ELECTED PRESIDENT:

October 26, 2015

Dr. Ward Welty

Huntsville, AL 35803–2426

Dear Dr. Welty:

Thank you for sharing your views with me regarding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s commission of high crimes and misdemeanors. I welcome the opportunity to respond.

Contrary to inaccurate media portrayals of my statements to the contrary, the issue I address is not the September 11, 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks. Nor is the issue about emails and email servers. Rather, it is about Hillary Clinton’s improper handling of classified documents and the risks such mishandling poses to America’s national security and American lives.

All of this reminds me of President Bill Clinton’s impeachment. Bill Clinton and the leftist Democrat news media went all-out to persuade the American people that Bill Clinton’s misdeeds were about “sex” and “lying about sex” (which we all know men do). Bunk! While Bill Clinton’s political deception was effective, the issue was not about “sex” nor was it about “lying about sex”. Rather, Bill Clinton committed the “high crime and misdemeanor” of felony perjury in a federal court proceeding, a form of obstruction of justice (for which President Nixon was removed from office).

Now Hillary Clinton and the leftist Democratic news media use the same obfuscation and minimization strategy when she claims it is about “emails” and “email servers” . . . which very few American citizens understand or care about. Bunk again! Hillary Clinton’s offense is not about emails and email servers, it is about knowingly and intentionally mishandling classified documents which, if they fall into the wrong hands, put America’s national security and American lives at risk.

Hillary Clinton’s conduct is so serious, so dangerous, so evil, and so wrong, that there are numerous federal statutes that prohibit it.

By way of background, and as you may know, in March 2013, a Romanian cyber-hacker named Marcel Lazar Lehel, aka Guccifer, asserted access to Hillary Clinton’s unsecure private email server which she used in violation of federal law to conduct sensitive state department business as Secretary of State. The issue of Clinton’s vulnerable email server was discovered during the House Select Committee on Benghazi’s investigation into the deaths of four Americans in the Benghazi terrorist attacks. Secretary Clinton’s gross mishandling of classified information via her illegal use of an unsecure server (left vulnerable to hacking and foreign surveillance) is a serious national security threat that puts innumerable American lives at risk.

According to Article II, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution “The President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”

In my judgment, Hillary Clinton will be a unique president in that, if she is elected by the public next November, the day she is sworn in is the day she could be subject to impeachment due to her prior commission of high crimes and misdemeanors.

For emphasis, Hillary Clinton’s putting classified documents on an unsecure email server in her home in Chappaqua, New York (and, perhaps, elsewhere) violates federal law! Period. End of subject. No further debate needed.

After revelations of Clinton’s unusual email arrangement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began a criminal probe into whether classified information stored on the server had been compromised upon referral from the U.S. inspector general. Though Clinton attempted to obstruct justice, and the investigation, by wiping her email server clean, the FBI successful recovered a significant portion of the deleted data from the server hard disk after seizing it from a small Colorado based IT company.

While the FBI probe coincides with House Benghazi Committee investigations, the two are otherwise wholly unrelated.

In a New York Post article dated August 5, 2015, former federal prosecutor Bradley Simon is quoted as saying, “If it is proved that Clinton knowingly sent, received or stored classified information in an unauthorized location, she risks prosecution under the same misdemeanor federal security statute used to prosecute former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus.” In my view, Clinton’s intentionally receiving, storing and/or sending numerous classified documents vulnerable to surveillance by America’s geopolitical foes is a far worse offense than that for which General Patraeus was convicted.

The United States Inspector General has also opened an investigation into Clinton’s unlawful conduct. In a July 23, 2015 memo, Charles McCullough, the inspector general for the intelligence community, voiced concerns over information that passed through Clinton’s email server. McCullough said the data should have been treated with greater sensitivity, since it was derived from classified information produced by the U.S. intelligence community.

Clinton’s only stated defense of her endangering the lives of American’s has been to obfuscate by claiming she never sent or received emails marked classified. Clinton’s presidential campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement, “Hillary only used her personal account for unclassified email. No information in her emails was marked classified at the time she sent or received them.” For emphasis, while Hillary Clinton’s “the documents were not marked ‘Classified’ defense” makes for good political soundbites, it is no legal defense at all. As a matter of law, and although emails may not have been so marked, the classified nature of the material is undeniable.

Stated differently, Hillary Clinton is a former U.S. Senator. As a U.S. Senator, she absolutely knew the standards for classification of national security information. She also knew how important it is to America’s national security and American lives for that information to only be kept in secure locations that are impenetrable to our geopolitical foes. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton had a double dose of instruction concerning proper protection of classified documents.

Yet, in the face of all of this instruction and warning, Hillary Clinton intentionally and knowingly stored, received, and/or sent classified documents in violation of governing federal statutes. These statutes are criminal in nature.

Further, Hillary Clinton’s declaration that, as Secretary of State, she at no time used email to transmit sensitive information with national security or foreign relations implications is unsubstantiated by senior investigators. Charles McCullough has made clear that at least one email, if not more, contained information that only could have come from the intelligence community. McCullough stated, “We note that none of the emails we reviewed had classification or dissemination markings, but some included [intelligence community]-derived classified information and should have been handled as classified, appropriately marked, and transmitted via a secure network.”

What’s worse, according to an Associated Press article dated October 13, 2015, classified information on Clinton’s email server was so vulnerable it was accessed by low skilled hackers without great difficulty. The article reads, “Clinton’s server, which handled her personal and State Department correspondence, appeared to allow users to connect openly over the Internet to control it remotely, according to detailed records compiled in 2012. Experts said the Microsoft remote desktop service wasn’t intended for such use without additional protective measures, and was the subject of U.S. government and industry warnings at the time over attacks from even low-skill intruders.”

The AP article goes on, “Some emails on Clinton’s server were later deemed top secret, and scores of others included confidential or sensitive information. Clinton has said that her server featured ‘numerous safeguards,’ but she has yet to explain how well her system was secured and whether, or how frequently, security updates were applied.”

William Johnson, a former Air Force officer who served at the state department from 1999 to 2011, stated in a New York Times article, “If I’d done that, I’d be out on bond right now.”

Further, I have spoken to numerous Department of Defense civil servants and contractors in the Tennessee Valley who deal with classified information on a daily basis. To a person they have told me that, had they handled sensitive material the way Hillary Clinton did, they would have been fired from their jobs on the spot and would have been subject to criminal prosecution. They also tell me that they are very upset with the double standard President Obama, the White House and the executive branch have employed in protecting Hillary Clinton versus how these Tennessee Valley employees would have been treated, and how they have seen others treated, for mishandling classified documents in a much less dangerous way than Hillary Clinton handled classified documents.

The intentional and careless way in which Hillary Clinton handled information vital to national security and endangering American lives is unacceptable and punishable by law. Should Hillary Clinton win the presidency, her callous disregard for federal statutes designed to protect America and American lives from the loss of classified information meet the Constitution’s impeachment standard of “high crimes and misdemeanors” and immediately subjects Hillary Clinton to the risk of impeachment proceedings the moment she is sworn in.

Sen. Chuck Grassley Joins the Hillary Email Non-Scandal Circus,"Sen. Chuck Grassley Joins the Hillary Email Non-Scandal Circus

The Right-Wing Congressional Circus has a new ringmaster: Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley.

Since the House Benghazi Committee, led by Trey Gowdy, failed so spectacularly in its attempt to find any wrongdoing in Secretary Clinton’s emails (because there wasn’t any), Senator Grassley is now taking a stab at it.

As a reminder, this is after the New York Times issued a frank mea culpa to admit it completely mis-reported the email non-story from the beginning.

…And after the Justice Department said the review of Clinton’s emails was not a criminal investigation.

…And after officials said the investigation is not targeting Clinton — or even suggesting that she did anything wrong.

It should be obvious by now that Republicans are hoping to drag this email non-scandal as far as it can stretch, and they hope it can stretch as far as Election Day 2016.

For evidence that this is a partisan fishing expedition, look no further than the Republican National Committee, which is pressing the State Department to investigate Clinton’s emails further. What reason does the committee — whose sole purpose is to get Republicans elected — have to investigate a former Secretary of State’s emails? Unless, of course, that former Secretary is a formidable Democratic candidate for President who stands in the way of the RNC seizing back the White House?

The latest email-scandal-revival strategy is to zero in on Clinton’s deputy chief-of-staff, Huma Abedin.

Grassley’s one-man “investigation” began as a crass probe into this committed public servant’s time off — ignoring the fact that someone who works for the Secretary of State has a 24/7 job and never gets a day off.

Grassley is asserting that there was some mysterious conflict of interest in Abedin’s role and her prior work for a private company. But, tellingly, his colleagues have refused to follow him down the rabbit hole — and are even telling him he does not have the jurisdiction to carry out his inquisition.

As Minority Leader Harry Reid said two weeks ago, “How much money will Republicans in Congress waste to try and bring down Hillary Clinton?”

It didn’t work the first time they tried, and it won’t work now. The simple fact is, there’s no there there — whatever these circus magicians try to pull out of their hats.",https://medium.com/@DavidBrock/sen-chuck-grassley-joins-the-hillary-email-non-scandal-circus-edb76958dc7a,['David Brock'],2015-11-24 03:49:49.849000+00:00,"['Hillary Clinton', 'Politics', 'Republican Party']"
Why Do You Hate Hillary So Much?,"On Twitter, I’m fairly well-known to many for my anticapitalist tirades and my seemingly inexhaustible well of feminist outrage. My sense of justice is inflamed. I have no fucks left to give for half-ass apologetics.

So when people ask me why I hate Hillary Clinton, the answer should be clear: I think she’s reformist bullshit personified. I think she’s a woman who will lie to millions straight to their face that she cares about them and their struggles while making backroom deals with lobbyists hedging on wordchoice and legalese to make sure she’s never held accountable.

Today, I wake up and find that CNN had deleted every online poll that indicated that the viewers of that debate felt Bernie Sanders won by a landslide.

This is some straight-up Orwellian bullshit, friends.

I think (LOL, I KNOW) they did this because Hillary Clinton is bought by the same corporate bullshit that has bought out our journalism. They’re the same fucking machine churning out the same poll-tested garbage.

But why do I hate Hillary Clinton so much if I’m a Leftist Commie Feminist? Can’t I see what she’s trying to accomplish? She’s struggled! She’s so determined! She’s making the best of a bad situation.

Whatever.

Hillary Clinton has proven to me during this campaign that she’ll say practically anything to win. And because she’ll say practically anything to win, she crosses a lot of lines of authenticity that I will brook from no politician.

As a poor kid growing up in America, I have known no fucking safety net and I have known nothing but a political regime that continually shits on kids like me trying to do the right thing so that middle-class families can have another mortgage deduction. Hillary Clinton is everything I can’t stand in the American Left and she can rot for all I care, feminist or not.

Hillary Clinton is not from the South, but she’ll fake a Southern accent if she thinks that will make you like her.

Hillary Clinton has never known hunger, but she’ll pretend to know if it’ll mean you’ll vote for her.

She has never known what it’s like to work a monotonous manufacturing job with maybe the glimmer of a fucking hope of a 25-cent hourly raise after two years of good behavior.

She has never known what it’s like to stay awake with a toothache for 8 weeks in a row, hoping against reality that it will go away because you don’t have $400 to spend on a cavity.

She has never had to choose between which medications to pay for this month, choosing between pain relief or sanity, as if that’s any choice at all.

She has never watched her daughter suffer through her twenties from long-term unemployment because her connections have made Chelsea’s career success an all-assured inevitability.

She has never known the struggles of most Americans, but she’ll pretend she knows because she thinks that’s what will get her votes.

And fuck, maybe it will.

But I don’t have to like it. I don’t have to stand by and watch her momsplain educational inequity to my generation suffering under Atlassian debt by saying young people should work a few hours a week to pay down their tuition as if working part-time at Waffle House at $7.25 an hour will do fuck anything.

She’ll convince you her ideas are terribly reasonable, but she can’t convince me that her ideas aren’t terrible.

So yeah, you know what? Fuck Hillary Clinton.

Arturito’s girl -Photograph Alex Waterhouse-Hayward

The idea for what promises to be a long blog came to me last Sunday. Both Randy Rampage and

birthday boy Zippy Pinhead kept calling Art Bergmann, Arthur. It struck me that his real friends call him that and for the rest of us Art is enough.

I then wondered how many Arthurs had gone through my life, who I not only photographed but somehow had left something of themselves in me.

So there is Arthur Erickson, Arthur (most called him Art) Phillips and Arthur Bergmann. There is one more.

Arturito Durazo Díaz (33) showed up in Vancouver in 1982. At the time I had some dealings with the unofficial Mexican Tourism Director in Vancouver, Carlos Hampe. I visited Hampe and noticed Durazo sitting behind a desk that had nothing on it in a room that was virtually empty of furniture and decoration. I was introduced to him. He was affable, friendly and interested in the fact that I was a photographer and that I spoke Spanish.

During his stay in Vancouver which was around two years he often came to my house for dinner. He had a passion for jig-saw puzzles. He often stayed for hours with my daughters fitting the pieces to 1000 plus puzzles. Durazo told me he had helicopter pilot’s license and wanted to learn to hang glide. I accompanied him to many of these lessons in Langley. He was brave and he tried to convince me to try. I told him I had no life insurance and since I was a free lancer, any accident would leave my family with no financial support.

My daughters liked him as did my wife Rosemary. One day he showed up with a box full of beautiful Florsheim shoes. He told me that inmates of several Mexican prisons made them and he was starting a business to import them to Canada.

Arturito’s 2005 police mug shot

Any questions I directed to Hampe about his “assistant”, who seemed to do nothing at the office, only resulted in the rolling of his eyes and silence.

All I knew was that Durazo’s father, Arturo Durazo Moreno had been the chief of police in Mexico City, between 1976 and 1982 during the 6-year rule of President López Portillo.

During those 6 years Durazo Moreno’s underlings had to pay their quota of contributions. There was an organization that arrested promising thieves who were protected and of course had to pay their quotas. In some cases these trained thieves and the policemen robbed banks. One of the biggest scandals was the appearance of 13 Colombians in the city’s main sewer. Some had their heads missing; others had been mutilated and tortured.

López Portillo’s successor, President Miguel de La Madrid initiated an investigation and the murders were linked to Durazo who fled the country.

That would explain why his son, also left the country and why Carlos Hampe could do nothing about having the man appear in his office and get a salary for doing nothing. I remember that Arturito had a better car than Hampe. It was a very large Pontiac.

Arturito was a handsome young man. His father was quite ugly and because he was dark-skinned he was called El Negro Durazo. Durazo died in 2000 after having served 6 years (he had been extradited from Puerto Rico, and given a 16 years sentence but because of “good behaviour” and delicate health he served those 6 for drug trafficking, corruption and extortion). At his funeral a police mariachi played a famous song about El Negro Durazo.

As soon as Durazo Moreno died the army generals rescinded his lofty rank of General de División. They had been furious when President López Portillo had celebrated the man with the rank.

But what perhaps riled the usually patient Mexican populace were the many mansions that the Police Chief built. The most famous one La Partenón in Zihuatanejo was said to have gates that had been stolen from the storied Chapultepec Castle (where young Mexican cadets had fought back with heroism but in futility against a well equipped American Army, one of the officers of this army a young Robert E. Lee.). You might know that U.S. Marine Corps song “From the halls of Montezuma…”

La Partenón

In the late 80s a Mexican cumbia band, La Sonora Dinamita recorded a song by its then singer Juliette called El Africano (The African) in which one of the lines “Hey mom, what does El Negro want?” to which then Juliette answers, “Could it be another Parthenon?” Of interest to readers here is the fact that Ray Conniff did an instrumental version of the song called African Safari.

This was my Arturito’s father. In 2005 Arturito was imprisoned for unlawfully taking over a large property. He is now probably out and is on Facebook.

If you look for images of Arturito you will only find one through Google. The Mexican newspapers announcing his arrest have blank squares where his picture should be.

I was never allowed by Arturito to take his picture but he did ask me to photograph his lovely Mexican girl friend who had brilliant bleached blonde hair. I have lost the colour pictures and I have forgotten her name but I did find some negatives which I took with Kodak b+w infrared film.

If I were to run into Arturito I would invite him for dinner and I would take out a box with a 1000 plus piece puzzle.

The Fight for the Metaverse,"Project Sansar: The Seasoned General

Last week I spoke with Ebbe Altberg, Linden Lab’s current CEO, who contacted me after viewing my flowchart on the current VR Ecosystem. He wanted me to know that Linden is a contender in this ecosystem with an entirely new virtual reality world — code named “Project Sansar” — that I had not included in the chart. Altberg emphasized that Project Sansar is NOT Second Life 2.0. He wanted to convey that everything in Project Sansar will be a brand new metaverse that conserves only two features from Second Life — the ability for users to easily create and sell content and the Linden Dollar currency system for buying and selling that content.

Altberg said that they could not just convert Second Life into a virtual reality world because of “performance issues” that arise out of “users (not) necessarily know(ing) how to create extremely optimized content like a gaming studio would.” To preserve that key feature for users in a VR environment, Linden Lab opted to create a new platform.

According to Altberg, Project Sansar’s platform will have user-generated content that is more scalable than what was possible in Second Life. He emphasized that scaling content would permit creators to license their work and, thus, generate more revenues. He gave the hypothetical example of Texas A&M creating a chemistry lab inside Project Sansar which could be licensed to other schools who could then customize it to their own needs and desires. When I inquired about software for content creation, Altberg said that Project Sansar content is currently using Autodesk Maya for rendering but Linden expects to change that by consumer launch day. Linden is also working on better discovery, which is a “walled garden” in Second Life, to allow anyone to search for a particular type of experience and link directly to a downloadable form of that experience in Project Sansar.

Linden plans to launch an Alpha version this summer to a few select testers as a PC virtual reality experience and then expects to tackle other platforms.

Why would anyone bet on Project Sansar to win the metaverse battle? I asked Altberg. He responded that Linden Lab has actually been in the virtual worlds trenches, sharpening their tools for 12 years and they have a user-centric, revenue-generating model that Altberg believes will give them maximum strategic advantage. Unfortunately, another major contender enjoys these advantages too because the general of High Fidelity’s army founded Second Life.

High Fidelity: The Experienced Challenger

After founding Second Life and staying for over a decade, Philip Rosedale, left the company in 2013 to pursue his dreams of creating the “next-generation virtual world” which he calls High Fidelity and diverges from Project Sansar’s vision. I have not been able to interview Rosedale but draw insights from key sources.

In his recent talk at SVVR, Rosedale describes the metaverse as something that contains the web itself; it encompasses what we define today as the Internet but it also allows us to live inside of it instead of merely accessing its content. He also believes, not surprisingly given his legacy with Linden, that the metaverse is a shared space where content should be created by its users. This is why he is building High Fidelity as an “open source software for virtual reality.” He wants anyone to be able to quickly generate a virtual space, have others join them inside that space and easily allow them to explore the various virtual worlds.

Like Project Sansar, Rosedale wants to ensure that the virtual worlds are scalable, and recognizes that it is critical to avoid Second Life’s struggles with scaling due to limitations caused by physical servers. In High Fidelity’s architecture blog, they note that they will be operating their servers in an open shared network, allowing many different people and institutions to deploy virtual world servers, interconnecting those servers so that people and digital objects can travel among them, and harnessing shared computing devices to scale their content and load.

Unlike Project Sansar, High Fidelity’s Alpha is already available for download and users can create and deploy virtual worlds, content and experiences. Thus, the experienced challenger has positioned itself on the metaverse battlefield first and may have achieved some strategic advantage that way.

In Rosedale’s talk, he indicated that, like Second Life and Project Sansar, High Fidelity is experimenting with revenue generation as a layer on top of their open network but it is proposed to operate differently than the others. High Fidelity users will be sharing their machines so the revenue model proposed would “create some kind of currency that is valued on computer time.” They have yet to decide whether it will be bitorrent or a blockchain currency. In sum, while High Fidelity has moved quickly to establish a strategic position for its metaverse contender, its Achilles’ Heel, at least at this time, would appear to be its revenue model.

Surreal: The Hungry Underdog

Surreal has no relation to Second Life but is also hard at work trying to create the “first fully immersive virtual world.” Unlike Project Sansar and High Fidelity, Surreal has no immediate plans for content within their virtual world to be user-generated. During their talk at a recent the NYC VR meetup, they said they were open to this but as of right now, that feature is not available. Because their world is built with Unity, they are not tied to a PC experience and proudly proclaim that Surreal will soon be available on any virtual reality device (Google Cardboard included). Currently, you can email them to request a demo version for Oculus.

Another difference is that your Surreal avatar will be tied to your Facebook identity. This provides a way to verify your identity and tie your virtual interactions to your real world social graph. Surreal’s CEO, Arthur Goikhman, clarified that they did this to protect their user’s privacy but would allow options for people to meet outside of their real world social circles.

According to their Facebook page, Surreal’s mission is “to make social games truly social.” Perhaps they want to approach the metaverse from a gaming standpoint, whereas Project Sansar and High Fidelity like to stay away from social gaming comparisons.

During the meetup, they also mentioned they would be monetizing the platform through product placement and selling items, such as clothes or experiences, but didn’t provide any details into how this virtual economic system would work.

Although my information is limited, it would appear that Surreal is the underdog in this battle, but they are hungry and attacking from a different angle. They will need to move quickly to outmaneuver both the more seasoned competitors for there are additional players entering this hotly contested battlefield.

Other companies like JanusVR, AltspaceVR and Next Galaxy are positioning themselves to enter the battle. I will seek more information for a future post on them.

The battle lines are taking shape and the competitors are lining up along them. It’s hard to predict a winner because they are fighting over turf that we cannot yet fully see — regardless of our VR equipment. All this makes for a conflict never before seen, yet classic in its human dimensions.",https://medium.com/@sophiaedm/the-fight-for-the-metaverse-811aef87d16a,['Sophia Dominguez'],2015-06-24 13:04:49.572000+00:00,"['Metaverse', 'Virtual Reality']"
What is the Metaverse and why you want to be part of it,"What is the Metaverse and why you want to be part of it

The Metaverse is the future of the Internet. The networked dimension of Virtual Reality.

Internet will be in 3D and this is no news. Even thou the concept of the Metaverse has been imagined, described, written and filmed for many years now, it’s only in the recent years that we are placing the first fundamental building blocks for virtual reality to be developed. Some innovators and notable investors in the Silicon Valley eco-system, have been working for some years on the idea of making a 3D version of the Internet, in other words the first version of the Metaverse. The buzz around VR devices such as the Oculus Rift, are only a part of what is moving around VR. While smart VR devices to simulate movement, presence and other interactions, are very important, what is fundamental for the Metaverse to come alive, is the existence of a platform and system architecture, to sustain it. The processing power we need to power up a virtual reality based Internet, is already there. We only need to connect the dots and leverage the immense calculus potential of the Internet as a whole. This is exactly what some visionaries and architects of the future of the Internet are doing. And this is happening right now. The enablers are there and we are developing the technologies that will allow us to experience a truly immersive Online Virtual Reality experience.

"The Metaverse as Mediator between Technology, Trends, and the Digital Transformation of Society and Business","The Metaverse as Mediator between Technology, Trends, and the Digital Transformation of Society and Business

Here is an intro abstract and link to a very interesting article, wrote in a collaborative effort between myself and two other Researchers: Sven-Volker Rehm and Lakshmi Goel, for the Journal of Virtual Worlds Research.

In this reflective article we discuss the potential of recent developments in virtual worlds for offering novel value propositions for the digital transformation of society and business. In particular, we consider the role of a Metaverse, understood as a globally accessible 3D virtual space and computing infrastructure — and today still a conceptual vision — as a mediator between technology trends and societal and business applications. We outline how current technology trends can be linked with high-value added application scenarios through the Metaverse as a mediating design space. Our insights project both a push effect, i.e. novel technologies fostering radical shifts in society and business, as well as a pull effect, i.e. radical ideas stimulating technology developments. Leveraging both effects for creating high-value added applications however, requires an integrated, mediating design space, which can potentially be obtained through advances of virtual worlds towards a Metaverse.

"The Fight for the Metaverse, Part II","What if the “fight for the metaverse” is actually less like a battle to the finish and more like a foot race in which the competitors have enjoyed different start times and stagger marks? Recall from my last post on “The Fight for the Metaverse, Part 1, I characterized a few companies engaged in an all-out battle for colonizing and dominating the metaverse — High Fidelity, Second Life’s Project Sansar and Surreal. What I’ve continued to learn is that these companies are better understood as those who got into the race earlier and now enjoy varied head starts but additional competitors are in this race too.

These newbies include: ConVRge, JanusVR, VRChat and AltspaceVR. Will they catch up? What will it take? Just greater speed or will they also have to be more agile, scrappier and determined? Perhaps, they will they change the course of the race itself.

On Your Marks, Get Set, GO!

ConVRge founders, Shawn Whiting and Hayden Lee, began developing ConVRge’s current interface about 6 months ago in Unity (a development platform used to create 3D and 2D games and interactive experiences) when they threw their first event, a virtual dance party. People from all over the world entered ConVRge as floating heads (their version of an avatar) identified by username. What they quickly realized was that it didn’t matter if the person’s head icon was a moon, someone’s realistic looking face or an animation. People loved the interaction in this platform because when they moved their head in real life to look at someone or something, the movement was mirrored in the virtual reality world. In the VR industry, this phenomenon is known as head-tracking.

With the success of their first virtual party meetup, the founders have turned these interactions into a staple of their social VR community. Each week they host a weekly virtual campfire meetup for people to come and socialize about whatever is on their minds, with no specific agenda or topic. Every two weeks they host a developer talk, where they bring an expert to talk about a topic of high interest, which attracts many newcomers. ConVRge has a particular strategy to its race tactics: instead of allowing people to explore various worlds, they have focused on building one main interactive space. The space looks like a valley, trees scattered around the hill-tops with a large screen floating in the middle to allow all avatars to watch together.

In some sense, this single room philosophy is a different metaverse than what Neal Stephenson defined in Snow Crash, “an immersive virtual world so complex and convincing that it would seamlessly and intimately interconnect to the ‘real’ world”.

In contrast to ConVRge, JanusVR’s race strategy seems premised on facilitating user autonomy and innovation. Founder of JanusVR, James McCrae explains that “JanusVR is reimagining how we use and interact with the internet.” JanusVR is building “a virtual reality interface to the internet” in which “web pages are rooms, and links connect rooms via portals.” Moreover and unlike all other metaverse contenders who are building with Unity, JanusVR uses HTML and Javascript because it wants to be “the Firefox, IE and Chrome in this virtual internet story” explains Nukemarine, a JanusVR contributor, on Zapchain.

The antithesis of a walled garden, JanusVR’s decentralized approach is to be a hyper-open development platform, focused on empowering their users to easily build and create new 3D environments into what McCrae calls a “fertile creative ground”. The developer community naturally gravitates towards this flexible environment, as demonstrated on their highly active Reddit page. JanusVR contributors are also encouraged to use websites like VRSites, a VR hosting and development platform, or SceneVR, which is making VR apps with HTML and JS, to also plug into JanusVR. According to Nukemarine, JanusVR plans to sprint ahead of other metaverse front runners by allowing you to connect into any platform (even competitors’) from JanusVR, something that none of the others (currently) allow.

The third new runner in the metaverse race is VRChat. Their strategy is best characterized as a combination of particular features found in the other two already discussed. Founders Graham Gaylor and Jesse Joudrey are bullish on users creating their own virtual worlds; however, unlike JanusVR, they use Unity arguing that it produces the best look and feel. The user-generated locations are an array of unique experiences, ranging from lush floating islands to large theatres.

Gaylor told me that the current version of VRChat began about 8 months ago. However, they have big plans in the next couple weeks to revamp the overall design of the entire experience. Below is an image of what the current design looks like:

Photo Inside VRChat

In a recent interview on Voices of VR, Joudrey said that “Social VR is a feature, not a platform”, which is why they built a VRChat SDK with a set of Unity scripts to “help easily add social experiences to your VR experience.” They believe that in order to get everyone into the “metaverse”, they have to make a system that is easy to build for in a short amount of time. Currently, they are known for having many playful elements built by their users, including a hoverboard and their glowing orb interface, which allows a user to open up a portal to another location and invite the users in the current room to be teleported together to the next location. This glowing orb interface also appears in JanusVR in the form of portals. Ready Player One, much?

Like ConVRge, they host weekly meetups which they announce on Twitter and Reddit. Their most well-known weekly meetup is called “Gunter’s Universe”, which occurs in front of a “virtual studio audience” comprised primarily of VR developers.

Now I turn to AltspaceVR, the company that recently raised $10.3M, grand totaling to $15.5M and distinguishing it from the other three who have yet to (publicly) raise capital. AltspaceVR has been spurred ahead by cheerleaders in the media and a strong community of developers and enthusiasts. Known for their robot avatars with distinctively hued fronts (iconic as un-customized avatars), they’ve been more focused on creating shared experiences than the aesthetics of their avatars. A step the company is taking in that direction is testing collaborative game playing in virtual spaces — including chess and Dungeons and Dragons. Outside of games, they keep their events page stacked with upcoming social AltspaceVR gatherings, where you can schedule an event of your own or register to attend one with others on the platform.

AltspaceVR’s CEO, Eric Romo told RoadToVR that “AltspaceVR wants to enable the creation of VR experiences with the same ease of web development.” Unlike JanusVR and VRChat, however, they have not yet allowed for users to create their own worlds or avatars and upload them to AltspaceVR.

Photo Inside AltspaceVR

A greater leap is their new browser extension. Imagine you find exciting content on the web and want to experience it in VR. With a click of the AltspaceVR extension, you can access that webpage in AltspaceVR and share it immediately with your friends. It’s as simple as bookmarking a page, yet allows you to experience your favorite content in a whole other dimension.

The Takeaways

One comes from Eric Johnson’s interview with Palmer Luckey, quoting him saying that “the term ‘metaverse’ is a bit undefined. For any one company to say, ‘We are building the metaverse’ is pretty hyperbolic. Building all the pieces is going to be hard, and the way you imagine things in sci-fi doesn’t always translate over to the way things will be in the real world.”

Perhaps there is no end to this race or as Luckey describes, there might not be just “one” race, but many different tracks that may one day connect together. The one sure thing is that in order for these companies to keep running on any track, they need to build a strong community that will cheer them during the upcoming laps and spur them to move faster more strategically. Without a strong community, any social VR company will be left in the dust.

We’re in the early phase of innovation for not only social VR, but the entire VR industry. Their journey of treading through the unknown landscape of social VR, will impact not only the future of VR but will help define what the next version of the consumer Internet looks like. As we analyze this industry, we must all remember that VR is in its infancy; it’s similar to the state of the mobile industry 12 years ago when the PalmOne launched.",https://medium.com/@sophiaedm/the-fight-for-the-metaverse-part-ii-f68f91283a6d,['Sophia Dominguez'],2015-08-05 01:39:41.363000+00:00,"['Virtual Reality', 'Social Virtual Reality', 'Metaverse']"
6 Reasons You’re Ready For An Epic Bike Journey Today,"6 Reasons You’re Ready For An Epic Bike Journey Today

somewhere in taiwan

If you’ve followed my wanderings and adventures on Instagram, then you know I’m all about bike travel. Whether you’re trekking across a state, or across the country, a bike trip opens up a whole world of badass discovery and adventure. I’m also a believer that traveling long distances by bike is something that just about anyone who wants to, can do. My bike touring philosophy is based on the idea that you don’t need a lot of money or expensive gear to have an incredible journey. So if you’ve ever considered taking a bike trip of your own, but haven’t taken the plunge, I’ve got six reasons why you might already have everything you need to set off on a bike adventure right now.

1. The Bike

This is where conventional wisdom starts to creep in and ruin the party. Don’t be fooled, an epic bike trip doesn’t require flashy, new bicycles. I purchase all of my bikes through Craigslist. The last two major trips I cycled were down the Pacific Coast and from Saint Louis, MO to Brooklyn, NY via Canada. Both of these trips were done with two different bikes priced at a whopping $40 each. Thanks, Craigslist! Obviously, If the latest and greatest bicycle works for your budget (or you already own one), more power to you! For everybody else, keep in mind that it’s not necessary at all.

2. Gear/Equipment/Camping

We live in an exciting world saturated with sexy, new technology, bike gear, and space age camping accessories. These are all nice (like, really nice), but you can do without these; especially if that sweet, new solar charger from REI is going to break the bank. There are all kinds of ways to support your tour without forking over all of your adventure cash. After my first set of panniers began falling apart, I opted to incorporate discarded things instead of buying a new pair. I began using milk crates and oil cans to carry my stuff. This is a much cheaper (read: free) and recycle-friendly way to travel compared to traditional panniers. You’re bike won’t win any beauty contests, but that’s not why we’re here, is it? Besides, I actually prefer the DIY Mad Max-ian look and feel of a touring bike put together from reclaimed and recycled objects.

For shelter, I suggest a tent (more on this later). I’m currently using a tent I purchased from a thrift store for $15. Additionally, I’ve used sleeping bags that ranged in price from $0 to $5. Just about anything you need for camping and bike travel can be found in mom and dad’s garage or your local thrift stores. However, If I do spend a little extra cash on anything, it usually goes to a solid rear and/or front rack.

3. Fitness

I know some cyclists out there that have pre-tour training regiments; the idea being that you need to be in shape, or at the very least, train hard before going on a bike trip. While I understand the reasoning behind this, I’d like to challenge this notion. Sure, you could train for hours every day, or you could simply just… go. The beauty of a bike trip is that it is YOUR journey. YOU get to decide how fast and far you want to travel every day. Remember, It’s not a race. Your body will have plenty of time to adapt to life on the road. No training needed. None. Seriously, all you need is a bit of time in the saddle, and you’re ready to bike across the country. I Promise :)

4. Accommodation

While biking from Saint Louis, MO to Brooklyn, NY I didn’t pay a single dime for accommodation. How? I spent the majority of my nights either bundled up in my tent, or sleeping under the stars in my sleeping bag. Where? Anywhere and everywhere. All it takes is a bit of imagination and some common sense. I found plenty of space behind stores, parking lots, fields, playgrounds, churches, schools, abandoned buildings, and even on an interstate construction site. And no, I was never mugged, attacked, followed or feared for my safety at any time. In fact, I’ve met some really incredible people during my urban camping experiences, including a homeless fisherman who insisted that I put my tent up next to his truck so he could watch over me and my stuff while I slept on the docks.

5. Food and Water

If you’re biking in the USA, this is easy. Food and water are EVERYWHERE. Most of the food I eat comes from dollar stores and discount shops. This means a lot of bootleg peanut butter sandwiches and off-brand cookies. If the cardboard-esque taste of name brand-less oreos doesn’t quite do it for you, there are the classic alternatives: gas stations, supermarkets and other chain grocery stores. For the more hardcore cyclists among us, dumpster diving is an easy option. And it’s probably a lot healthier than my own touring diet. For more info on dumpster diving and bike travel, check out this dude → Rob Greenfield.

As for hydration, water is clean and free all over North America, and can be found just about anywhere: libraries, gas station bathrooms, parks… anywhere. Drink up!

6. Lycra/Spandex

Completely unnecessary

There it is

I’ll end by saying that none of this is gospel. Adopt all of these ideas, some of these ideas, or none of these ideas. Use whatever bike you’d like, stay in hotels or slum it in a tent, eat whatever you want, and if you look hella fabulous in spandex, then by all means go for it! For me, travelling by bike isn’t about living a life with rigid rules designed by someone else, it’s about freedom and living an adventure on your own terms.

Tips in Choosing an Ideal Indoor Cycling Bike,"Tips in Choosing an Ideal Indoor Cycling Bike

There are so many fitness and health enthusiasts which have the plans on investing for an indoor cycling bike. This is due to the fact that these are considered to be one of the best machines to have for improving a person’s cardiovascular. Riding this kind of equipment will offer a person with complete cardiovascular workout. If you carry out an indoor cycling workout that’s directed well, you will be able to keep your heart rate steady in different ranges for several minutes to an hour. If you wish to gain a constant cardiovascular activity, it could be possibly achieved through the use of such machine. It will also be able to help in lowering risks of coronary artery disease, LDL cholesterol, overall resting heart rate and blood pressure.

You could actually find different brands and models when it comes to an indoor cycling, which is the reason why a lot of people have a hard time in selecting one that’s right. In order to make sure that you are going to invest for one that is right for you, it is important that you use the simple guide provided in the article below.

It is very important that you consider the features of the equipment. All of the modern indoor cycling bikes from spin-bike-reviews.com will mostly have a display, resistance control, heart rate monitor and also comes with a programming feature. These things are designed purposely for you to get better health and fitness goals.

There is also the importance to where you should look for a model which is easier to adjust and is going to offer you different workout levels. Most of the newer indoor cycling has the presence of an electronic resistance control. The resistance can in fact be adjusted electronically through the use of such controls.

It is also very important that you select one with a display which is easy to understand and also easy-to-use controls. A suitable indoor cycling bike display from http://www.spin-bike-reviews.com/sunny-sf-b1110-spin-bike-review/ is going to show some combination of heart rate, calories that were burned, resistance levels, speed, RPM and other details that are helpful like distance and time.

It is also important to consider looking for an indoor cycling bike where the heart rate monitor is connected to it through a chest strap. This is very important that you should be considering because a heart rate monitor that’s connected to an equipment with the use of a chest strap is never going to impede your movement.

The last thing would be to select an indoor cycling machine together with an easy to use programming feature. Any machine which have programs that is going to enable you in adjusting routines being based on your fitness level. You should also have a heart rate workout that’s controlled based on your age, gender and weight as well.

The Top 5 ‘New’ Cycling Cafes in the UK,"The well documented rise of cycling has lead to many positives; the expansion of the UK cycling network, an active online community, and a national team we can finally be proud of. Another very welcome institution on the rise is the ‘cycling cafe’.

For many years cycling cafes were the dwelling of hirsute East Londoners, trading couriering war stories and swapping rare Japanese fixie parts. However, as the sport of cycling has become more mainstream, thanks largely to Tour de France victories and the media coverage that affords, a new crop of cycling cafes have emerged. This new breed are doing their bit to grow the sport by turning on new cyclists with advice, camaraderie and excellent coffee!

The Velo House, Tunbridge Wells — http://www.thevelohouse.com/

Opening in 2014, The Velo House quickly became the focal point of the burgeoning North Kent cycle scene. Ollie and the team are cyclists first and foremost, and they have kept that in mind with their refuel, reduce and reward mantra. They serve Coffee Officina, Tea Pigs and a wide variety of beers and wine, alongside a delicious, healthy menu. Upstairs the shop sells an eclectic mix of cool gear, and the workshop team in the back can fix, shine and tune your bike whilst you wait. Weekly club rides and regular events are also on offer to feed your cycling habit.

2. Rapha Cafe, Manchester — http://pages.rapha.cc/clubs/manchester

The name Rapha is now synonymous with high end, high quality cycling kit, so it’s no wonder that their first cafe offering in 2012, in central London, was a huge success. So much so that the brand have opened another ‘cycle club’ in Manchester, and it’s doing just as well. Many have written off the cafes as a ‘gallery’ to show off Rapha products, but it’s hard to argue with the style and atmosphere they’ve created. Alongside events, exhibitions and film screenings, there are also organised weekend club rides out to Cheshire and the Peak District. If you’re lucky, you might even bump into a Team Sky rider or two!

3. Dandy Horse, Norwich — http://www.dandy-horse.co.uk/

Norwich may be (in)famous for Alan Partridge and Delia Smith, but it has an exciting and emerging cycling culture to rival anywhere, and an excellent cycling cafe in Dandy Horse. They sell excellent coffee which changes daily, alongside fresh cakes and sandwiches. The workshop is staffed with over 10 years of mechanical and wheel building experience, so your beloved steed will be in good hands. What Dandy Horse pride themselves on, however, is their custom builds and restorations. Take in your frame (or pick one of theirs) and have them build your dream bike. Grab a coffee and drool over the beautiful selection; you won’t be disappointed.

4. Pedalling Squares, Newcastle Upon Tyne -http://www.pedallingsquarescafe.com/

Pedalling Squares is so much more than a cycling cafe! An event space, a retro jersey emporium and a ‘Supper Club’; there’s always something going on at The Old Brassworks. They brew locally sourced ground coffee and ‘feed stations’ offer ‘cycling legend’ themed panini’s (we had Greg Lemond). The Workshop is run by Vieri Velo, the nicest bike blokes in the North East! They’ll fix your bike, fit parts you’ve brought in for free, and even buy you a coffee (if you’re extra polite).

5. Maison Du Velo, Reigate — http://www.maisonduvelo.cc/

Maison Du Velo is the perfect pre or post ride stop if you’re out in either the Surrey Hills or the North Downs. This ultra-modern cafe and shop has a gallery feel to it, with the bikes and kit very much ‘on display’. They are passionate about the choice brands they stock (and the coffee they serve), and have complete confidence in their performance ability. The workshop team offer a range of services and comprehensive Bike Fit options to make sure that your setup is on point.

The Dangers Of Walking Through Red Square,"My University has a popular area known as “Red Square”. Due to the campus buildings placements, the unpremeditated area is beautifully shaped in a square-like shape; covered with red bricks as far as the eye can see with a breath-taking fountain right in the middle. Filled with many tall trees, tables and benches, and usually many people, some could say it’s like a park. It is a really great place to walk through, but it’s not as safe as it looks.

As I rush to class with my headphones blasting my favorite music into my ears, blocking out all the sounds around me, I have a consistent fear of bicyclists, skateboarders, long boarders, or any other transportation that fall under my “death with wheels” list striking me from behind at any given moment.

With its busy hours in which there are a plethora of people clumped around in weird shapes, I can only imagine someone on their skateboard trying to get around these peoples at unsafe speeds for whatever reasons and making a mistake(maybe because of the uneven ground) that could injure themselves and other people around them. I have yet to see somebody get hit by someone on a bike or skateboard, but I’m sure it’ll come eventually.

Red Square’s ground isn’t very well known for its smooth surface. I have many times almost tripped due to the uneven bricks layered out, especially ones that are placed at a steeper angle and catching the tips of my shoes. However, I’m not the only one. For the week I’ve attended at this University, I’ve witnessed dozens of people almost tripping and even a few actually tripping. Imagine the dangers if it was near stairs. Because there are actually stairs. Like 3 of them.

As a student at this University, I think other students along with myself could agree that fixing up the ground would fix some of the fears of embarrassment some students might have. I also think that this school really needs bike lanes going throughout Red Square and even the entire campus. If we have designed bike lanes going through red square, it would make students/staff less afraid knowing that people who are using bikes, skateboards, etc., are in their specific lanes and have a less chance of hurting anyone. The University of North Carolina has long before placed bike lanes around campus so if you want to listen to music without having to worry about the thought of bike tires digging into the back of your shoes and jeans followed by the weight of someone and their bike, that’s where you need to be at.

Long story short, if you plan on staying at this university, please be aware of the danger. Either pray that bike lanes will be introduced to Red Square, wear some shin/arm guards, or wear one headphone and constantly look behind you. Either way, you’ll probably get hit eventually.",https://medium.com/@ThatOneTwin/the-dangers-of-walking-through-red-square-71e0010c034d,['Brandon Lauersdorf'],2015-10-13 01:50:32.623000+00:00,"['Cycling', 'Bikes']"
Products I love — Specialized AWOL Comp 2016,"Every now and then I get so obsessed about a product that I need to shout about it from the rooftops. This is one of those shout outs.

I’ve been cycling for about eight years now. In the last couple of years I have transformed from a simple work commuter to a raging road racing lycra clad MAMIL. During this time I’ve gone through seven different bikes, five of which from Specialized.

For the last two years I have also been cycling through Icelandic arctic winter blizzards. There are a number of challenges related to that like freezing brake cables and being stuck in the same gear for days on end.

Last winter was exceptionally heavy on the snow and I upgraded from my Globe Vienna commuter to a Rockhopper 29er mountain bike that seemed to fit the bill on our island of 4x4 monster jeeps.

It was a very nice ride with excellent gear ratio and hydraulic disc breaks.

"“No, he’s not black, he’s Brazilian”… with Diego S for Elska Magazine","One of the most interesting legacies of having spent my childhood in America was the casual racism that permeated everyday life. After having spent my entire adult life in England, the comparative lack of racism astounds me, and I still marvel at the amount of mixed-race couples around as if that was something extraordinary.

At the age of eight, my mother got married, and the new ‘wealth’ brought by having a second income meant that I would be sent to Catholic school, which required tuition. I wasn’t sent there for religious reasons but for safety. The new Catholic school was no more than fifteen minutes by foot from my old public school, but demographically it was worlds apart. At the new school it was purportedly less likely that I’d end up being murdered on the playground there. That new school was totally white.

Ok, to be totally honest, there were a couple of Latinos, but one was Ecuadorian and the other’s family was from Belize. The point was made, however, that they were “not Mexican or Puerto Rican”. These were the bad kind of Latinos, the ones who joined gangs, sprayed graffiti and shot each other outside the 7–11. Ecuador? Belize? Nobody talks about them in the news.

In the final year at St Ferdinand Parish School we got two transfer students, a twin brother and sister. They were black. And they were the first black people we ever saw in six years at the school so far. Most people thought this was big news, but the twins were well-liked, so the news wasn’t spread in an aggressively racist way. These kids were “good” but black was still “dangerous”, so there was a standard reply whenever kids from the neighbourhood would say “I heard you got some black kids at your school now”… I’ll always remember the response, “No! They’re not black, they’re Brazilian”. I guess that not having your ancestors brought up picking cotton in the Alabama sun was safe, no matter what colour your skin actually was.

Why 3 foul mouthed Brazilians are Exosphere’s first incubated team,"Why 3 foul mouthed Brazilians are Exosphere’s first incubated team

The first time you meet the Scribe team you might think you had run into the Brazilian version of “Jersey Shore”. The way they talk to each other might be strange for someone who is not aware of how these three co-founders came to be. Luckily, the Exosphere staff saw them sprout and as none of us speaks Portuguese we aren’t shocked by the profanity they are constantly spewing at each other in their native language.

As an organization we do not encourage this sort of behaviour at all. We entirely disapprove of it actually. Then why are they one of the first teams we have decided to incubate?

Well, you might think it must be their product…for sure they must be on to a killer product that will go viral in a couple of weeks and change the entire Internet as we know it, making millions for the founders and investors alike.

In reality their product is still pretty flawed. They added the ability to create hyperlinks only a few weeks ago…Pretty shocking considering they are an online writing and publishing platform isn’t it?

They are in beta after all. So, maybe it is because the buzz they have already generated with nothing more than their early-stage beta. People in Brazil and all over the world must already be talking about leaving Wordpress for a platform that really gives them what they want. This must be the reason.

No, it’s not the buzz either. Although they have been quite successful and already attracted an impressive number of users and generated content in less than 3 months, they are still relatively unknown and working on getting themselves in the mind of users as a writing platform worthy of consideration.

Then why did we choose them? Why did we decide to invite them to stay with us at our Viña del Mar campus in Chile, and support them in building Scribe?

In the ever-incisive wisdom of @FAKEGRIMLOCK:

RIGHT PEOPLE MOST IMPORTANT STEP FOR STARTUP. PEOPLE WHAT STARTUP MADE FROM!

BUILD STARTUP FROM RIGHT PEOPLE? THEM EVENTUALLY BUILD RIGHT THING.

Getting the right people to build the right thing is what we do at Exosphere, and is the mission of our boot camps to attract the right people and help them develop and reach their full potential, regardless if that is building a startup or taking life-changing decisions they would have never thought of in the confines of their everyday environment. We are not a startup incubator, we are a people incubator.

Attracting the right people is not an easy job, and it never follows a plan. But the good thing about it is that once you get the first one it creates a positive snowball effect that spreads really fast. Paulo Ribeiro, a friend of one of Exosphere’s founders, was attracted to our philosophy and started spreading the word about us in Brazil. Alberto Brandao found Exosphere because of Paulo, and attended the first boot camp, where he started blogging about his experience here. Eventually, three Brazilians from Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and São José dos Campos, read about Alberto’s experience and applied to the following boot camp. So this is how everything started: five Brazilians from five different cities who didn’t previously know each other.

Get the right people on board, because, sooner or later, they will build the right products.

Alex, Eduardo and Kelvin are young, they don’t have years of startup experience, and they have never lived in Silicon Valley.

But when you spend a couple of months with someone discussing Emerson’s Self-Reliance, Nassim Taleb’s Antifragile and Scott Peck’s The Road Less Travelled, you don’t need long CVs to know what they are capable of creating. You don’t need a pitch of their product to be convinced of their true value or several interviews to get to know them, because you know them as real people, not the persona portrayed in an accelerator application.

This is the reason why we don’t hold pitch events, or have open applications for our incubation programs. You can learn little of a team’s potential in a canned ten minute presentation.

But if you spend more than 200 hours with them discussing their path in life, their goals, their fears and motivations, their relationships in life and how they deal with everyday challenges, then you know their real Curriculum vitae, experience and qualifications not just from their businesses but from their lives. This is what we do in our Hydra boot camp in Chile.

Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.

Self-Reliance, Ralph Waldo Emerson

What is it to be an entrepreneur but to pursue and keep the integrity of one’s mind? To be a nonconformist and dare to want more? The only thing that empowers one to reach her potential is the strength of her mind.

We don’t want the next over-hyped app that Facebook will buy to defend its market territory against nascent competition. We want to incubate teams that are serious about solving a real problem for real people. Teams that are serious and committed to their own personal growth, not only as entrepreneurs, but as individuals. Teams that loudly embrace with their actions and aspirations our mantra Disturb the Universe.

This is what we found in the Scribe team.

This is where we stand—this is what we believe. It won’t be the so called “disruptive technologies” that will achieve real disruption. It won’t be the low-cost space industry, the 3D printing, the Internet of Things, or mind reading technology. It will be the people behind them. The people who dare not to conform, the people who dare to defend with vigour the sacred integrity of their mind, the people who dare disturb the Universe.

The world is full of small ideas and small-minded people behind them— just read the business tabloids like Business Insider, you’ll find a lot of stories about them. But for the story of people with big ideas, stay tuned to Exosphere.

Why Brazil will always be the country of the future,"Why Brazil will always be the country of the future

Earlier this week, a Brazilian judge ordered a 48-hour shutdown of WhatsApp, the most popular messaging service in the South American country, after it failed to comply with a court order to provide information on one of its users. More than 90 percent of internet users subscribe to the service, which has prompted Brazilian phone companies — who charge the highest rates on the planet — to call it an “illegal telephone service” on the basis that it doesn’t have the same overheads as they do. All this sounds rather like the brouhaha at the beginning of the century, when telecoms players protested at Skype’s “piracy” (the term used by Telefonica Brasil). They do things differently in Brazil, it would seem.

The WhatsApp shutdown wasn’t about “piracy”, but instead the company’s refusal to provide information about a customer involved in a trial, and should be seen in the context of the Brazilian government’s steady erosion of internet neutrality. Brazil’s Congress, the credibility of which has been eaten away by institutionalized corruption (the country’s president, Dilma Rousseff, faces impeachment), has fought tooth and nail against a civil rights framework passed in 2014 that aims to guarantee internet neutrality and privacy, freedom of expression, along with limited responsibility on the part of telecoms providers to share their customers’ information.

Opposition to the civil rights framework has been led by telecoms companies and politicians obsessed with controlling the internet. At the head of this unholy alliance is the president of Congress, Eduardo Cunha, a former lobbyist for the telecoms sector and who faces corruption charges. He wants to pass laws that would require Brazilians to identify themselves on the internet, giving their personal details, to be stored for three years by their internet provider, and that in turn the government could demand to see, without a judicial order. It has been dubbed “the big spy” by Brazilians. Congress sees the internet as its enemy, a place where journalists and civic associations are free to criticize its members, many of whom are implicated in corruption scandals. Rather than do something about corruption, it seems easier to just shut down the internet and silence the population.

Brazilians are among the planet’s most active internet users, and have carried out many successful protest campaigns against their (mostly) wretched politicians, for example on the eve of last year’s World Cup, they highlighted the need for other investment priorities.

Corruption, draconian laws, absurd bans (WhatsApp’s main rival, Telegram, reported one million new users in one day following the shutdown) and politically bankrupt. The internet has become the barometer of the democratic crisis in a country that not long ago was considered one of the world’s most exciting emerging economies. Little wonder that Brazilians, long weary of their country’s failure to meet its enormous potential, like to tell visitors with a sardonic smile: “Brazil: the country of the future… and it always will be.”",https://medium.com/enrique-dans/why-brazil-will-always-be-the-country-of-the-future-ea529a46295d,['Enrique Dans'],2015-12-18 07:49:17.720000+00:00,"['Brazil', 'WhatsApp', 'Corruption']"

Selected Pieces from My Honors Thesis for the Department of Latin American Studies

Maya A. Taft-Morales — Tufts University, 2015

Chapter 1: An Introduction

In the spring of 2014, when I was a junior at Tufts University, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Salvador, Brazil and conduct a small research project around lesbians and their experiences in Salvador. After returning to Boston, I drew upon the research I’d conducted to write a Senior Honors Thesis, for which I earned highest honors in the spring. But a thesis is a tough read, and I wanted to make my findings accessible to a broader audience, and especially to Brazilian readers. So, I partnered with a Brazilian student at the Fletcher school, Alessandra Caria, to translate smaller portions of my thesis and post them in a way that makes the information readable. I will be posting the chapters, in both English and Portuguese, on a regular basis. If you would like a digital copy of the entire thesis, please feel free to request one!

Because we all make up the environment in which lesbian women are either supported or put at risk for negative outcomes, the findings of this research are relevant to a very wide audience. This research has the power to inform and embolden lesbian women and allies, activists and lawmakers, and anyone looking to become more educated on the experiences of young Afro-Brazilian lesbians in Salvador and the various factors that affect them.

As this is the first post of a series, I’ll start with the abstract. Following that, I’ll post narratives that provide small snapshots of six young Brazilian lesbians’ life stories. The following pieces will come from my discussion of my results, in which I analyze different factors that contribute to risk and resilience for the individuals I interviewed.

Enjoy!

Abstract:

Cultural, social, legal, and spatial aspects of Salvador, Brazil contribute to both risk and resilience for young lesbians living there. This research investigates what socio-cultural and legal environmental factors put young Brazilian lesbians at risk of negative mental health outcomes and how social and legal support contribute to their resilience in a political and cultural context that simultaneously harbors progressivism and heterosexism.

To do so, I conducted and analyzed in-depth interviews with young Afro-Brazlian lesbians from the area. The research revealed cultural heterosexism, with Christianity as a strong root, to be a macrosystemic risk factor, with parental rejection and familial silencing as a microsystemic risk factor. Subjects noted risk factors on the exosystemic level to be subtle and overt informal sanctioning in both public and commercial spaces, and absolute heteronormative dominance in high school. On the other hand, Afro-Brazilian religion, the Internet, and progressive laws educated, affirmed, and empowered subjects, proving to be a resilience factor in their macrosystem. Participants also discussed support from siblings, relatives, friends, and activist groups as microsystemic resilience factors. Lastly, private LGBT venues, periodically occupied public parks, and progressive university departments served as safe spaces and exosystemic resilience factors. This research is valuable to a wide range of people, including policy makers and enforcers, family members and friends, as well as leaders of religious and commercial spaces because they all play a role in the mental health and well being of lesbians.

The following posts will give you a glance at the lives of the six women I interviewed for my research project. Once we get to know these women, we can discuss the risk and resilience factors in a more systematic way.

Bucatini And Red Sauce,"Bucatini And Red Sauce Welcome to Qorkz Kitchen! Today we are doing one of our own recipes and making fresh semolina Bucatini pasta from scratch. We are then finishing the pasta in our homemade red sauce. This dish is hearty with just a little kick of spice and is perfect for a cold fall day. We hope you enjoy it! Ingredients For The Pasta 115 grams of Semolina flour

225 grams of durum flour

1 tablespoon olive oil

2 tablespoons water

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon fine ground black pepper

3 eggs Flour measurements are by weight. We like this kitchen scale for our measurements because of its weight zeroing function allowing us to weigh everything in one bowl. Directions Mix the semolina, durum, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a stand mixer to incorporate them together. Then slowly add one egg at a time, then the oil, and let the dough start to come together. Depending on the humidity in the kitchen you’re working in, the dough may be finished at this point or still may need some water to help smooth it out. Add the water one tablespoon at a time until the dough forms a ball and comes away cleanly from the sides of the mixing bowl. Because this dough is destined for a pasta extruder, it can’t be too dry or the pasta will crack and fall apart as it’s being extruded. The dough coming away from the sides of the bowl cleanly. Once the dough comes away cleanly, form it in a ball on the counter and then wrap it in saran wrap to rest for 30–40 minutes. For this next part, we use a Kitchen Aid pasta extruder to create our Bucatini pasta. Available Here. If you don’t have a pasta extruder, this dough could be rolled out into sheets and hand cut into the noodles of your choosing.

Forming The Pasta Take 1/4 cup of the semolina flour and coat the counter of your workspace. Then roll the dough out gently until you have a disk about twelve inches in diameter. Next, cut the dough into smaller sections roughly equal in size. Once you have your pieces cut, roll each one into its own smaller dough ball to go into the pasta extruder. To form the noodles, attach the extruder to your Kitchen Aid with the Bucatini plate inserted. Turn the power on to full. Take the dough balls one at a time and insert them into the top of the extruder. They will work their way down the screw inside slowly, so be cautious of that and don’t overload the machine. The pasta will come out the bottom fully formed and you cut it off at your desired length. Air dry the noodles on a pasta drying rack for 30 minutes prior to cooking. This step makes a big difference in the integrity of the noodles as wet noodles are more likely to stick and clump together during cooking. We like this pasta drying rack for its easy storage. Boil the pasta in salted water for 9 minutes or until mostly cooked through. The noodles will cook for additional time in the red sauce prior to serving so you don’t want to overcook the noodles, but because there was raw egg used in the dough, be certain to cook the noodles thoroughly. We did not add any oil to our water as that would coat the outside of the noodles and make it harder for our red sauce to stick.

Meatless Red Sauce This red sauce is our go-to for hearty pasta dishes when we don’t want to have a big meaty sauce. It is rich and fragrant with just a touch of spice.

Ingredients 28 oz can whole peeled Roma tomatoes

1 bunch basil

8 cloves of garlic sliced

1 tube/can tomato paste

1/4 cup olive oil

1/4 cup balsamic vinegar

1 cup red wine

1 tablespoon red chili flake

1 tablespoon dried basil

1 table spoon garlic powder

1 tablespoon dried oregano

1 tablespoon salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

5 bay leaves. Using a heavy bottomed pot, add the olive oil, garlic, and 10 fresh basil leaves and cook over medium low for ten minutes to bring out the garlic and basil flavor to the oil. Once the garlic and basil have cooked through, remove the basil from the oil leaving the garlic behind. increase the heat to medium and add the tomato paste. Cook the tomato paste for five minutes or until it starts to brown on the bottom of the pan. Add the balsamic vinegar and stir for another two minutes. Move the paste to the sides of the dish and add the red wine directly to the center of the pan to deglaze any parts of the tomato paste that have stuck to the bottom and then stir the whole mixture together and cook for another 1 -2 minutes. Pour the tomatoes into a blender or food processor and pulse 4–5 times until the tomatoes are chunky but not smooth. Add the tomato mixture into the pot slowly so as not to splatter the hot tomato paste. Next add all the spices along with ten fresh basil leaves and give the whole sauce a stir. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for one hour stirring occasionally. If the sauce reduces too much, add another 1/4 cup of wine or 1/4 cup of water to thin it back out. Remove bay leaves prior to serving.

Bring The Dish Together Remove the pasta from the pasta water but do not rinse. Bucatini is a pasta that is hollow inside so it is going to retain some of the pasta water inside of the noodles, which will help add some salt and starch to the sauce. Pour the Bucatini directly into the sauce and stir to coat. Simmer the pasta on low for about five minutes to bring the dish together. To serve, use thongs to twist the pasta into a bowl and grate some Parmigiano Reggiano over the top and ad one basil leaf for presentation. “Pasta and red sauce and Merlot.

Grape Notes: Pinot Noir,"Photo Credit: Left Coast Cellars

My first memory of pinot noir was over a creamy chicken dinner in an underground, hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Beaune, France more than six years ago. Sure, I’ve probably tasted pinot noir before this time, but I didn’t really know about it. Not like this. My husband, Michael, and I were spending our fourth year together as a married couple, and we decided to visit Burgundy — ride bikes through vineyards and taste some amazing wines. It was here, in this idyllic French wine region, that I got to know pinot noir as an earthy, smooth, comforting wine that has become my go-to Thanksgiving red-wine pairing. Since then, I’ve enjoyed this fickle grape in its many wine forms. The most common introduction to pinot noir is it’s classic presentation as a light-bodied red wine. Pinot noir can also be part of a sparkling trio, being one of three key varietals found in Champagne, or a rebellious white wine.

Dinner Party Trivia: Pinot noir is a varietal has been used to create new grape varietals when crossed with another varietal. For example, the South African pinotage resulted from crossing pinot noir and cinsault (known as hermitage in South Africa). Similarly, the Bulgarian bouquet is a cross of pinot noir and mavrud (an indigenous Bulgarian varietal).

Chapter Eight: A Suspect

“Do come in, Inspector. I always make it a point of principle to make myself available to the constabulary whenever they come calling.”

Tinnion’s eyebrows raised, and he couldn’t entirely hide the brief smile that passed across his face. “You have a lot of experience with the police, do you, Ms Wellington?”

Amanda Wellington chuckled, and she motioned for the detective to sit down opposite her, across the desk in her office.

“Not much,” she said, “but as Collections Manager, I occasionally get approached by your brothers in blue to be asked questions about particular wines. It’s usually to give valuations if there has been a theft. I’m considered something of an expert.”

Tinnion hid his exasperation well; they had so far met a grand total of two times, and Wellington had mentioned that she was Collections Manager on both occasions. The detective was never a great one for ego and titles — indeed, he hardly ever bothered introducing himself as an inspector, and much preferred to be judged on his own personal merits — but he was intrigued by Wellington’s strange desire to be known as the main Collections Manager. It was like she was keen to remind him that she managed the overwhelming majority of Quintessentially’s wine and resources.

“So, how long have you been here?” he asked, choosing his words with care.

“Just over a year,” she replied promptly. “I was recruited by the CEO himself.”

More status, Tinnion thought disparagingly. A dislike of this woman was growing in the pit of his stomach even before he had managed to steer this conversation down whatever path it was going to take. He knew that he needed to take that emotion firmly under control, however, as he didn’t want to start making assumptions about anything that could end up skewing the investigation.

“Did you know before taking the job that another Collections Manager was already in place?” he asked. He wasn’t surprised to see a scowl fly across her face before quickly vanishing again. She clearly wasn’t as good as hiding her emotions as she would have liked.

“No,” she said smoothly, as if the irritation hadn’t happened. “I found out on my first day when Adam introduced himself.”

“How did that make you feel, knowing that had been kept from you?”

Wellington hesitated for a moment, seeming to think about it before speaking. “Well, I was surprised, certainly. I -” She blinked and then frowned as a thought seemed to occur to her. “I’m a suspect,” she said slowly. “My word, you actually suspect me, don’t you?”

“Where were you between 1am and 1.30am this morning, Ms Wellington?”

“At home, in bed … asleep.”

“Can anyone verify that claim?”

“I live alone, Detective.”

“That’s not what I asked.”

Wellington’s jaw set in an angry line. “No,” she snapped abruptly. “I was in bed by myself.”

“Well, those are the pleasantries,” Tinnion said in an altogether more cheerful tone, flashing his most charming smile. “Now that they’re out the way, let’s move on. Everyone is a suspect, irrespective of where they were at the time of the theft.”

“I see your point,” Wellington said, “except for one fatal flaw in your logic, Inspector. I still don’t have the foggiest idea what the theft entails. To this day, I don’t know what Adam is curating down in that dungeon of his.”

“You make a good point,” Tinnion noted. “Thank you explaining your ignorance about the collection so cogently.”

Wellington suddenly smiled, the anger of a moment ago seemingly forgotten; she had obviously decided to tune out his sarcasm.

“You remind me of Columbo,” she said quietly. “I’m expecting you to say ‘One more thing …’ any minute now.”

“The day I hit that stereotype,” Tinnion said, continuing to return the smile, “is the day I need to hang up my badge for good.”

There was a silence between the two of them for a moment that was surprisingly companionable, and Tinnion was intrigued to know what Wellington would say next. He had found silence to be a very useful trick from time to time, as most people were uncomfortable with a lack of sound and rushed to fill it. A lot of time, what they filled it with was the verbal equivalent of white noise; generalised babble, small talk and chatter, just to keep the noise level going, but occasionally — just occasionally — they would give something away. It might just be a Freudian slip or a thoughtless, throw-away remark, but that could be incredibly telling.

Sadly, Wellington wasn’t one of them; people who were comfortable with silence between themselves and a stranger were rare, but she was one of them and Tinnion was impressed. He mentally cursed; he had been hoping for something more. The old adage of being innocent until proven guilty wasn’t something he believed in, but he was making assumptions here without any proof — and trying to tease out information that might not even exist.

Wellington shifted her weight to lean her right arm on one of the chair arms, and smiled serenely at him. Tinnion decided to drop the act; it clearly wasn’t working, and he could well have been overanalysing the situation anyway — there were situations when suspecting everyone simply wasn’t the right course of action. Now, he needed to focus on questioning everyone else; in particular, Mr Collins, the security guard. He was someone that could well know more; he had spent so much time just outside the vault door that he must had picked some useful snippets of information up.

“Well,” he said in as polite and calm a tone as he possibly could, pretending that the last two minutes of carefully gauged silence hadn’t happened, “thank you for talking to me, Ms Wellington. It’s been a pleasure.”

“I’m sure it has,” she said with a self-deprecating smile. “I hope I’ve been of some help.”

Tinnion nodded. “It’s always useful to be able to rule people out,” he said.

The Wine Rule,"I take a lot of meetings, both personally and professionally as the founder of the watch company Martenero. There’s no set format — meetings can be in an office, cafe, bar, or just walking through the city. Anywhere really. They can be highly structured or off the cuff, goal-oriented or purely exploratory. As a whole, there’s very little consistency, which works so well because every person and every situation is unique. But there’s one not so little thing that is alarmingly consistent — people are always late, and they don’t think that it’s a big deal. They arrive 10, 15, even 30 minutes late, say that they are ‘sorry’ and ‘so busy’ and then look to me for empathy. They think that a disingenuous sorry makes everything okay. Well, it doesn’t. You disrespected me and my time, and you owe me more than a sorry. You owe me wine.

THE RULES

For these offenders I have created The Wine Rule. It’s quite simple and effective. Full set of rules below:

1) If you agree to meet me at a certain time, I will make every effort to be on time and I expect you to do the same.

2) There is a five minute grace period. I’m happy to consider a few minutes late as being ‘on time’.

3) If either party is more than five minutes late, that party owes the other a bottle of wine (nothing fancy; a drinkable $12 bottle will do).

4) Wine must be delivered within one week, or there are additional penalties.

5) I will enforce the rule with no exceptions.

WHY I DO THIS

I see two major reasons why chronic lateness is a big deal:

It’s Disrespectful

All of us have limited time on our hands, and I don’t think there’s a single person that doesn’t have better things to do than simply wait for someone else who can’t follow their own schedule.

You’re forcing someone to adapt to your own schedule rather than respecting both of your schedules. Whether you realize it or not, you’re sending the message that your time is more valuable than the other person’s. It’s not, and this is narcissism. Stop it.

It Likely Encourages Sloppiness In Other Parts of One’s Life

I don’t believe that actions exist in a vacuum. If you don’t do something as simple and fundamental as abiding by your own schedule, think about what else you could be mismanaging in your life:

What person close to you have you neglected contacting?

What project at work or on the side do you keep putting off?

What hobby do you always think about pursuing but (realistically, at the current pace) never will?

Begin by respecting both your own and other peoples’ schedules, and I would bet that that would carry over positively to other areas of your life.

THE REACTION

When I first tell people about the wine rule, I tend to get universal buy-in. They love the idea, agree that ‘everyone else’ is chronically late, and tell me how they have the same problem.

But when that person is late and I actually enforce the rule (see rule #5), people freak out. They are inevitably surprised that I enforce the rule, genuinely believe that they should be an exception to the rule, and that this one lateness was ‘different’ because they have ‘so much going on’. More than one person has begged not to have to pay up.

I’m constantly amazed at this reaction. You see, I don’t buy your excuses and I don’t care anyway. No, this time isn’t different, you’re not special, and you’re going to give me that bottle of wine because that’s what we agreed to.

THE AFTERMATH

Usually people get so annoyed after buying a bottle of wine or two that they are never late afterwards. There’s just something about this little gesture that people find so irritating, and avoiding these negative feelings becomes the prime motivator. This is a little piece of fascinating human psychology I’ve stumbled upon — how people can be so motivated not by any sense of enjoyment or fulfillment but rather by avoiding negative feelings or shame. Perhaps something worth exploring more deeply in the future.

After I created The Wine Rule everyone’s punctuality improved remarkably, and an aura of fun even developed around the whole thing. It’s become a joke, a friendly competition to see who can be on time the most. Not something I would have guessed was possible.

So the next time someone is late to meet you, and they offer you a dismissive ‘sorry’ which they clearly don’t mean, my advice is this: Smile, and utter those beautiful words: You owe me a bottle of wine.

"Nothing is Accidental: Two Girls, One Wine","Nothing is Accidental: Two Girls, One Wine

Ashley is an intro level sommelier. You probably don’t know what that is. You’re forgiven— I didn’t know the details or the the intricacy of the job until she started on her journey to ultimate alcoholism. Sommeliers study wine and all that is involved in the exquisite process that give us the liquid of my people (social drunks). Variations of grapes are regional in countries all over the world, making each a unique and specific fruit. The dirt grapes are grown in affects the taste — I mean, who knew?

Now, I like wine. White preferably, or a light red. Why do I like wine? Mostly because I don’t love people, and wine doesn’t throw shade, or piss me off, or tell me to do things for it. Wine just lets me get a little drunk and relax. Wine is good to me. I don’t care where its been, or where it’s going, as long as we’re together at the end of a long day.

Ashley is very concerned with where her wine has been. She has to know the “why” and “how” her wine came to be. The make up, the essence of wine. She immerses herself in it, sipping slowly as I knock half a bottle back.

Our view from A Voce, overlooking a snow dusted Columbus Circle.

Ashley and I have gone to wine tastings before. Last February, we walked into A Voce in Columbus Circle — her as a potential buyer for the liquor store where she works, me as a social alcoholic — and stumbled out like fools. The other buyers were spitting their wine into communal buckets, which I considered wasteful (and disgusting). Ashley and I tasted 75 wines that day, which ended with us as the youngest, most under-dressed, drunkest people in the room. We asked for the wine list at dinner and waiter denied us. It was 4:30pm. Moral of the story, we know how to taste wine but Ashley has been practicing “blind” tastings, an integral part of the sommelier certification test. I thought it would be interesting to see how Ashley, well on her way to being an expert, understood wine as opposed to an uncultured swine like myself.

I walk into her house without knocking. I can hear her sitting in the kitchen with her mother, shouting at the Yankees as they lose to the Houston Astro’s. She’s clapping at the television, nods in my direction like a brute. I lay on the floor with her dogs.

This is our friendship.

Eventually, fed up with a Jeter-less squad, Ashley sets up her dining room table for our tasting. Two bottles of wine, two sheets of printer paper, four glasses and a glass pitcher. This already seems like too much for me.

“We’re going to be testing a theory”, she explains, placing the various items in perfect photo-op position. “We’re going to determine if decanting makes a difference.”

I stare at her blankly. She shakes her head and continues. “Decanting is the process of letting wine breathe. When the wine touches the air…” This went on. I am interested, but I just really, really would like a drink.

“Wine is starved of air, especially if it’s a Stelvin, or a screw cap. A cork lets a very small amount of air in, but air nonetheless. The second the air hits the wine, the wine is like “OH SHIT, HELLO!” and it’s characteristics usually end up changing. We’re here to determine the difference.”

Ashley pours the entire bottle of the deep crimson liquid into the pitcher. “This will allow the wine access to air a little quicker,” she adds, drawing columns for tasting notes on the sheets of paper she laid out. “Did you cleanse your palate?”

“Excuse me?” I know I have a foul mouth but now she was just being insulting.

“Rinse your mouth. You just ate dinner and drank raspberry ale. It’s gonna fuck with your tastebuds….I’m serious, Monica cleanse your damn palate!” I lethargically walk over to the kitchen sink. “How much longer do we have to wait for the wine to breathe?” I whine.

“Ten minutes.”

We wait. Ashley is taking pictures of wine glasses, I’m petting her dogs, and bantering with her mom. We are still waiting for this wine to catch it’s breath. I’m getting impatient. Finally, Ashley tells me its time and pours the wine into one of my glasses, which I instantly scoop up and dive into taking a sip, ready for it’s warm, boozy embrace on my lips.

“WAIT! We haven’t tested it yet! Stop holding it by the glass, you’re going to heat the wine and change the taste,” she scolds, grabbing the glass from my hand. “Jesus, your hands are hot as fuck.” I’m baffled.

“So you’re telling me I can’t drink yet…” What kind of cruelty did I subject myself to? This was my idea, wasn’t it…

“We’re going through the steps. First is sight.” She holds the glass up to the paper, attempting to look through the liquid. “This is a Shebang Ninth Cuvee, which is basically just a fancy way to say ‘a bunch of shit mixed into a barrel together.’ It doesn’t really make any sense to me. The middle is blood red — notice how you can’t see anything? There’s no opulence, but its lighter on the outside. The color hints whats in it, how old it is, the alcohol content. Makes me think that its blended Zinfandel, Petit Sirah maybe…we’ll check later.”

All I know is that I can’t see anything, its red, and kind of pink on the outside rim.

“Swirl it in your glass. Do you notice heavy drippage?” I laugh at the unnecessary sexual innuendo I created in an otherwise unsexy situation.

“Ew,” I giggle. “Drippage.”

“Thank you, Monica. Anyway, the streaks indicate that this has a really high alcohol content.” Good to know, because I need a solid buzz after all of this.

We moved on to the smelling part of the program. I stuck my honker into the glass and started rattling off scents. This is the part I like — early on in Ashley’s studies, we used to just name the things we smelled in wine, no matter how strange or absurd. Cat pee, maple syrup, grass, you name it. No smell was off limits even if it sounded like a strange ingredient for wine, because there was always a reason the wine smelled that way — the soil, or the region, or the grape, or the fermenting process.

“Swirl, smell, swirl, smell, swirl, sip.” Ashley instructs.

I swirl. A deep breath in floods my sense with raspberries and black berries and booze. Swirl again — straight vodka. I feel like my nose hairs are singed. I have a flashback to senior year high school, drinking raspberry Smirinoff in Jonathan’s basement. Mildew and rubbing alcohol and fruit. Lovely. I complete the process and finally, after 15 long minutes of waiting, take a hearty sip of this boozy fruity drink.

Salt walter. It tastes like vodka and salt water and it is disgusting. I swallow and almost gag, my mouth turning immediately into the Sahara Desert on it’s hottest day.

“Oh GOD, that’s fucking terrible,” I spatter, trying to bring moisture back to my cat tongue by guzzling water. “That tastes the salt water and death, and my mouth is SO dry, what is happening!”

“Tannins. It’s a dry wine, so there are a lot of tannins, making your mouth dry. Give it another sip. Let it sit in your mouth, suck some air through your teeth. I don’t think you tasted it right, so try again.”

“Again? Jesus.” I take a less generous sip this time, following Ashley’s specific instructions. The taste is infinitely worse.

“No. This…no, I’m pissed this wine is ass.”

“Yeah it’s not my favorite, but its important that we try the second bottle anyway, so we can determine if allowing the wine to decant actually makes a difference. I guarantee you’ll hate the second bottle more.” Very encouraging.

We now have to go through all of these steps a second time. The sight and smell were mostly the same, but the alcohol aroma was infinitely stronger this go-round. I was not thrilled to be drinking this sandy, boozy wine again, but it was my stupid idea to write about this stupid wine, so might as well complete the task at hand.

Swirl, smell, swirl, smell, sip. Salt water and booze, but less terrible this time. Less dry, more acidity, still intolerable.

We’ve completed the procedure. Twenty-five minutes, two bottles of Shebang, endless complaining on my end, all to conclude that decanting does in fact make a difference in the taste of wine. Ashley confirmed that the grapes she expected to be mixed together, were in fact part of the make up of this wine. The girl has skill. In the end, I preferred the undecanted wine; Ashley chose the opposite. If you’re thinking of giving this wine a taste, you should aim to drink the whole bottle in under 10 minutes. After that, too much air and you’ll be salty. Literally.

It is an amazing process honestly — the knowledge she has obtained and shared with me is so intricate and detailed and sultry and deep. I don’t have the patience for it — I drink wine to unwind. Ashley drinks wine to expand, explore regions of the world she’s never seen; understand a soil her feet have never touched. Her cultural acknowledgement is astounding. Her tastebuds are astute, picking up on flavors and textures my palate recognizes but cannot identify.

When we were cleaning up our mess, Ashley broke out a bottle of white that I could stomach. Pouring a glass, I quipped, “Honestly Ash…that wine was bad.”

“Just because you don’t like it doesn’t mean it’s bad,” she replied, evoking a raised eye brow from my corner of the table. “I don’t mean bad in regard to taste. I mean that your disgust doesn’t mean the wine is bad quality. This wine is intricate and bold and…honestly it smells like booze, but there’s a reason. Nothing is accidental.”

What an astounding metaphor. Nothing is accidental. Nothing would be worth the wait, or the taste or the warmth if we took a liking to everything. Sometimes you wait and you get a mouth full of salt water, like an unexpected crashing wave, slamming you in the face. And sometimes, after you let the moment — or the person, or the wine — breathe, you are met with a mind opening, mouth watering something, worth every second.",https://medium.com/wine-stories/nothing-is-accidental-two-girls-one-wine-6f2cfa0e4253,['Monica O Connor'],2015-11-05 14:07:24.066000+00:00,"['Wine', 'Sommelier', 'Humor']"
An Approach To Relaxation,"Two years ago I gave up my home, gave away my belongings on the street in Chinatown and left New York with only a suitcase, headed into the unknown. It’s been a whirlwind and the dust is only now beginning to settle.

Along the way there have been many lessons and some that rocked my very center and tugged at the strings of my heart until it’s lovely juices happily poured out. There were also many long nights of wrestling with my decision to leave my friends, my home, my job and my city to embark on this journey.

Through it all, one thing became crystal clear: that I am the luckiest girl on the planet.

I have a best friend, I have a creative partner and I have a lover — all in the same person: Richard Betts.

I mean, who knew it was possible, to have all of the best pieces in the chocolate box?

Together we’ve gone deep to find what we both believe in, what we both want to put our collective weight behind. It had to be something we had a crush on, something that we wanted to paw at and take down… It had to be something that included a challenge, with a point of view that we could add to, something that wasn’t already ‘figured out’.

If I’ve learned anything since I left New York two years ago, it’s that a project such as this is really the most valuable kind. Everything is thrown onto the table: suggestions you’re unsure of, ideas you feel strongly about, things you are embarrassed you don’t already know…

You realize it’s not about you or your great idea at all; it’s about this super-cool opportunity to take an idea, and along with your partner, spin it from a lovely momentary gossamer thread into a bad-ass web of strength and purpose.

So yeah, An Approach To Relaxation will make wine. But the end goal is far more rich; we want to give you our all. All of the good shit we’ve mined from traveling over 300 days a year, all the scrumptious stuff we’re making, a peek into our own little world of ideas/ questions/ dreams; but most of all, a fantastic sense of levity in an otherwise dangerously serious life.

So come on! Jump on in!

We may bite, but not too hard.

A few things I learned from my sister on her vineyard,"Les Arabesques is in the South of France, about 30km west of Perpignan, between The Corbières and The Pyrénées mountains.

In the past year I’ve had the chance to spend more time with my sister Saskia on her vineyard, Les Arabesques. She owns a small estate in the Roussillon region of the South of France. It’s about 30km west of Perpignan, between The Corbières and the Pyrénées mountains. She is committed to growing grapes and making wine in a traditional and natural fashion. It’s still very new, this year was her third harvest. I’ve had the chance to learn more about winemaking talking with her, and occasionally helping throughout the season — so I also got some practical experience of the process.

The first thing that keeps blowing my mind is the timeline she works to. All she does is dictated by nature and seasons. Every choice she makes has an influence over her potential livelihood for the following 12 to 18 months or so. She creates the best context and environment possible, maybe give things a nudge in the right direction, and lets nature do its work.

I know it’s always been that way, but I’ve never been particularly close to nature. I’ve been used to working in large cities and advertising agency offices where the briefs are due yesterday. Everything needs to happen faster and faster. Everyone is busy and power-walking around. As soon as I arrive in a city, I walk faster from the moment I get off the plane or train. I spend time with brand clients trying to understand and explain the evolution of consumer or purchase behaviours. Peering over new and popular technologies, networks or apps that may well be obsolete or irrelevant tomorrow. Obsolescence is a recurring theme, businesses even bake it in their products, or if not release new goodies on shorter and shorter cycles to always create news and needs.

My sister works with the seasons. The project cycle is a year or more and necessarily adaptive. While the general seasonal pattern is the same every year, and the tasks roughly take place in the same order, there are still a lot of variations depending on the weather. She has a direction in mind for her wines, though has to adapt to what nature throws at her.

Winter is pruning time. While the vines are sleeping it’s time for her to go through all her plots and snip off the unwanted branches. I spent a day with her last winter where I was “pre-pruning”. Basically just cutting off the major branches without going into the detail, which are important choices she makes herself. She told me pruning is the job where the most knowledge and experience is required. There are several techniques she learned while being trained in Burgundy and Provence. As I understood it, she visualises the path the sap will most probably take from the roots to the branches. This guides where she prunes to encourage the growth of branches that will bear the most and/or best fruits for the harvest. It is quite similar to pruning a bonsai actually. Now she is getting to know her vines better in the third year, she also has a better idea of the way they behaved in the last harvest, pruning also based on her experience. Most of that work is done by herself with her dog, in cold, windy yet often sunny weather. She says there’s something meditative about caring for her vines during that time of year that she really enjoys.

In parallel, winter is also time for several professional exhibits and shows. It takes a lot of time to make the wine, and it takes time to sell it too. This year she was invited to participate in what is often considered the best professional show for organic and natural winemakers, Renaissance des Appellations (Return to Terroir). The yearly event gathers many of the best natural winemakers, sommeliers, and wine importers from around the world.

And if that wasn’t enough work already, the wine from her previous harvest is slowly getting ready. She has to watch out for any sudden shifts in temperature that might upset the wine in the cellar, check and taste it on a regular basis. Christmas is luckily a quieter time where she can generally take a few days off, away from her cellar.

The fullrange of Les Arabesques for 2013.

Spring time is mostly about fertilising and treating the vines, caring for them so that they’ll be able to be healthy, and resist trouble from fungi, diseases, or insects. That means going out before dawn to sprinkle the vines, as well as removing rocks and weeds from the plots. I tried removing weeds. It’s hard work. Stooped over with a small pickaxe hacking at the rocky terrain. It was another opportunity for her to make fun of my city like habits and general uselessness when it comes to most manual labour. It’s also bottling and labelling time for the wines from the previous harvest that are ready to be sold and drank. That’s where I’m more comfortable, particularly the drinking part of it.

The spring time work carries over into the summer, and then there’s a quieter time before harvest when many of the local winemakers can take a holiday, around late July or so. The rest is about selling wine, watching out for the weather, checking the progress of the growing fruits, watching out for any trouble that might take place, and generally gearing up for the harvest. I helped on the harvest for the first time this year. It’s tough work for the back, but it’s also a good time. It’s fun to be outside in the beautiful countryside, bantering with other grape pickers under the watchful eye of my sister’s partner. He plays the role of mock tough supervisor, to the tone of “I don’t want to see a single leaf in those baskets! We’re not brewing tea here, monsieur!”

Everything at that moment is crucial, from the grapes picked or set aside, to the choices made in the cellar. Are these grapes ready to be harvested yet? How much sugar content do they have now and how does that compare with the alcohol level I’m aiming for? How many days should these grapes ferment before being pressed? With or without the stems? These are only a few of the questions she has on her mind at that time of year. There might be more bottling beforehand too, for the wine from the previous year that wasn’t ready for consumption yet, and to make space in the cellar for the new wine.

Grape juice fresh from the press.

I learned that grapes for rosé and white wine are pressed immediately after being harvested. Grapes for red wines can be pressed later, the when and how depends on the kind of wine being made. I tried the age old tradition of stomping on grapes, which is both harder work than it seems and pretty satisfying. It’s not just folklore, it serves an important purpose. Given the grapes have just been picked, the berries are still firm. The press works from the top down and is flat. Stomping the berries helps more grape juice to be extracted. If they aren’t stomped then a lot of berries can be stuck at the bottom without being pressed, and you can lose a lot of juice.

As soon as the excitement of the harvest is passed, it’s already autumn and time to keep in contact with her clients, as well as find new ones. Most wine cellars and restaurants start ordering and stocking up for the end of year holiday season. Meanwhile she also has to watch out for this year’s wine fermentation progress. Update Facebook with new photos from the harvest. Watch out for any press or worthwhile professional show opportunities. Then of course there’s the joys of year-end admin and finance.

And the cycle starts again.

As a strategist an important part of my job in advertising is to synthesise everything I learn from research for a particular brand in order to provide a direction for the creative team. While I might have the chance to do some research with people and try a product or service before a write a brief, I rarely have that much time to really experience it in the way I have with the vineyard in the past year, and even then I’ve probably only skimmed the surface. That said, I certainly have a new appreciation for working with nature that I hope I’ll be able to take into account for future work.

What I’d write in a brief is traditionally called a single-minded communication, or proposition. Most of the time it’s one sentence, as short and inspiring as possible. It encapsulates the main message to be communicated.

In this case It might be a shame to try and summarise something as complex as this process to a single short sentence. It would be near impossible to do it justice. Traditionally made wine like my sister’s should really be tasted (I recommend getting advice from a professional in a wine cellar or restaurant to try a good one). Each one is unique. You won’t necessarily like every one you try, but you’ll find one that you enjoy. If you get into it you might even have a hard time going back to mass produced wines.

Fortunately I don’t have to write a short sentence here. If you’ve read this far you may well be the kind of person that will remember and appreciate the amount of work that goes into these wines when you taste one.

Saying Goodbye To Fear On The R-Train,"Saying Goodbye To Fear On The R-Train

On the R-train, stopped for half an hour. Someone’s sick in the train in front of us. Tending to the ill means sitting for the rest of us. At least everyone has a seat. It is a Saturday, 12;15 when we left. Some are getting antsy and annoyed, namely the man sitting next to me. “Just take the sick person off of the train. Then we can go. Just take them away”, he pleads. Others are looking around, maybe searching for similar feelings in the faces of those sitting around them? Some are sleeping. I’m listening to a podcast that I’m thankful downloaded before we lost service.

I’ve been feeling anxious myself lately. Lost in the everyday tasks. Struggling with the voices in my head asking questions about the future. What do you want to do? Where/what are your passions? Should it be this hard?

I’ve tried to write. It’s feeling forced. This all started a few weeks ago. When I got back from California. I’ve been going in circles. Write more like this. Write more topics on “that” subject, whatever it may be.

But here I am, now on a moving train (thankfully) listening to a podcast from The Guild of Sommeliers — the Past and Future of the Sommelier. I start to wonder…why do I keep toying with the decision to deepen my understanding of the world of wine yet almost always move away from it? Brushing aside the innate interest and enjoyment that arises when I watch a documentary, talk to someone at a wine store who tells me about a particular wine that would pair perfectly with my spicy sausage pasta with red sauce, when listening to these podcasts, or the (good) anxiousness of waiting for Into The Bottle to come out and wishing I could go to the Napa film festival to see its premiere.

While stuck on the R, I think I’ve figured it out.

Fear.

The possibility of failing. Not having whatever “it” is to make it. The wine industry was somewhat foreign to me when it came to being a profession. Other than making almost everyone I know watch Somm with me (going on 9 times now) when I find the chance to bring it up in a conversation, I don’t think many people I know are aware of the opportunities either. The unknown can be scary. It’s not accounting, marketing, law, medicine, etc. It’s a somewhat non-traditional path.

So, as I sit here, an hour after I left my house with still 30 minutes till I reach my destination, I realize I need to stop letting fear stop me. I know what I enjoy. I know where my passions are growing.

Now, I just need to get to it. I can do this.

As the beginning of this post reads, I wrote this on a Saturday — a few weeks ago actually. It is now Wednesday night and I’m happy to say I have officially started my journey! This afternoon I signed up for the WSET Level 1 course. The first level will cover the main styles and types of wine, the characteristics of the primary wine grape varieties, wine service and tasting technique to name a few topics. The course doesn’t begin until December (unless I get off the waitlist for November!) but I cannot wait to begin.

Celebrating with that bottle pictured above, carving pumpkins, and listening to a halloween playlist (monster mash, anyone?).

Don’t let fear hold you back from taking that first step. You’ll never know what you can achieve unless you try. Because really, what’s the alternative — wondering if you could have done this or that? Going over the “what ifs”? Not pursuing something that makes you happy? Life is hard but it’s much harder if you settle and don’t go after pure happiness.

So, cheers to saying goodbye to fear and acknowledging my passion while stuck in train traffic, to late night writing, and to a lot more wine in the future!

Thanks for reading!

Chapter Ten: The Oenophiles

“So, talk to me, Ken. Tell me about wine.”

Wilkes smiled. “Well, it’s made from grapes, sir, and you can get red, white or rose.”

Tinnion paused, half-way down in his chair, and fixed the sergeant with a steely glare that had a glint of humour in his eyes.

“When do you retire again?”

“Not until my family are free of childhood diseases. So at least another ten years.”

“Good.”

Tinnion sat down fully and stretched his legs out under the table. He suppressed a yawn — his body was reminding him that he had been up late the previous night — and crossed his arms across his chest.

“Why do people get so passionate about wines?” he asked. “I mean, why do people care about wine so much? You don’t get connoisseurs of lager — well, not that I’ve heard, anyway — so why do people become connoisseurs of wine?”

“Because of the variety and quality, I think,” Wilkes said. He frowned. “At least, that’s the impression I got from my research. People like the fact that there are so many different vines, types and qualities of wine to choose from, each with their own flavour, taste, smell … well, the list is endless, really. It becomes just as much a social occasion as something to drink.”

Tinnion nodded. He could see that; he always saw adverts for wine tasting around London, being advertised outside pubs, supermarkets, wine stores … well, anywhere there was a piece of advertising hoarding. A lot of people seemed to enjoy coming together to savour wine, and Wilkes’ explanation as to why made sense.

“Matthew Jukes, from Quintessentially Wine, is one of the best-known wine buyers and organisers of specialist wine events in the country,” Wilkes went on. “His reputation precedes him. It’s certainly no surprise that Adam reacted as he has done to the theft; wine wouldn’t just be a job to the staff there, it’s got to be a way of life. With someone like Matthew — and Stevie, the chief exec — leading them, their passion has got to embed itself into the rest of the staff.”

“So, wine lovers see their passion -”

Wilkes interrupted him; “Oenophiles, sir.”

Tinnion blinked. “Say again?”

“Oenophiles.”

“Well, I don’t think that’s any way to talk about them, Ken. I mean, just because it’s not necessarily our cup of tea -”

It was Wilkes’ turn to roll his eyes. “No, sir, an oenophile is the official name of someone who is passionate about wine.”

“Oh.” Tinnion squirmed in his chair. “I thought it was some kind of social disease. Thank god you corrected me before I made a fool of myself — well, more so than usual, anyway.”

Wilkes smiled genially, but didn’t say anything. Tinnion cleared his throat, returned the smile and went on; “So, oenophiles see their passion as more of a lifestyle than just a hobby, is that a fair assessment?”

“Yes, sir,” Wilkes confirmed as he nodded his head. “That’s why businesses like Quintessentially Wine exist in the first place; to help people with their love of wine. Oenophiles like to enjoy, appreciate and, perhaps more importantly, collect wines.”

“Ah yes, wine collectors. I remember reading stories every now and then about people having special rooms built for the collection — underground, or climate controlled, or whatever.”

“Yeah, for those that can afford to do that, that’s definitely a growing trade. Not everyone can afford it, of course, but that doesn’t stop them from building up a collection. People develop particular preferences to wines from certain regions, types, grapes or ways of creating the wine.”

Tinnion raised an eyebrow. “Don’t you just crush a load of grapes in a big vat and squeeze the juice out?”

“Oh dear,” Wilkes said wearily. “Absolutely not. It’s more than just crushing the grape. There’s different needs for white and red grapes, the chemicals needed for the process can vary according to what type of wine you’re trying to create and how much fizz needs to be brought out -”

He stopped as Tinnion raised a hand to forestall any more detailed explanation. “Alright, alright,” he said, “I get the picture. I stand corrected — it’s clearly more complex than I gave it credit for. I’m certainly beginning to appreciate why people enjoy wine so much, given the fact that so much work goes into it.”

“It’s not just that, sir,” Wilkes went on, thoughtfully. “It’s the ability to … well, I don’t know if I’m doing this justice, but it helps a lot of people to widen their palate, understand more about different cultures and how they value wine development, and mix with like-minded people.”

Tinnion was intrigued; Wilkes was waxing lyrical about the wines in a way that made the inspector wonder if he wasn’t a secret oenophile himself. Tinnion asked him the question outright, and Wilkes grinned, but shook his head.

“No, sir,” he replied, “but I know what I like, and the missus and I always share a bottle every Friday night I’m home.” He paused and seemed to think about it for a moment. “Every Saturday night as well, to be honest with you. But I’m not a connoisseur — like the people who belong to places like Quintessentially Wine, for example. We’re rank amateurs compared to people who join wine societies.”

“Yeah, I can appreciate that now,” Tinnion said, feeling thoughtful as he absorbed Wilkes’ briefing. It was a whole other world that he hadn’t fully appreciated before; like Wilkes, he enjoyed a bottle of wine, and knew what he liked, but it paled in comparison to people who knew what they were talking about — and knew what they were drinking.

He could imagine that many of these connoisseurs would only like one thing better than a bottle of wine lovingly poured, and that was a bottle from someone famous. The status and kudos of owning a bottle from Churchill, Shakespeare or even — perhaps whisper the name — Napoleon would be a huge cachet. Whether they ever actually drank it or not was probably irrelevant; it would be the act of owning it that was important.

More notes than a story.

Arrival

It was good to be received by sommelier Germain Léhody and hostess Mari Dartnall, who immediately create an air of confidence around the experience that awaits us. Very different from the the demure reception by docile staff you often encounter in other places.

There is strict entrance control at the gate by forthright attendants, and upon arrival you are escorted from your car through the entrance and up the stairs into the restaurants, in the welcoming warm embrace of aforementioned hostess and sommelier.

These little things set the tone for a fine afternoon (hopefully).

Overview

Mosaic Restaurant is part of the of The Orient boutique hotel, which is an architectural monstrosity in the sticks outside Pretoria, and which in my humble opinion serves no other purpose than harbouring Chantel Dartnall’s culinary brilliance. If she would no longer be there, the palace ought be flattened for reasons of it being an alien/invasive species of architecture.

Inside the restaurant, they have been able to create a more restraint balance between the gauche and the kitsch. Oversized Gustav Klimt reproductions and faux Belle Époque tile murals sum it all up. It feels like the luxury version of the Hansel and Gretel house. I kind of like that, especially retroactively, since it forms such an extreme juxtaposition with the epicurean delights. I want to believe that all the tackiness is there for a reason: to make sure that the overall experience is not too easily brilliant, and to force diners to cut through all the ornamental indiscretions and arrive at the only truth of this place — outstanding food and wine — so that only true gourmands will endure the decorative transgressions and keep coming back all the time. But that would be giving them too much credit. I think they really like to recreate the phantasy world of the Arabian Nights and the Brothers Grimm.

Enough of the negativity now. Based on this particular experience I feel that Chantel Dartnall is the best chef in in Gauteng, possibly in the country. I have not yet been to The Test Kitchen, but from a purely culinary point of view I rate this restaurant higher than for example Five Hundred (actually, by a mile) and The Tasting Room (but not THAT much).

The music is at the right level and supports the meal. Funny that they still seem to use CD players, since the music skips often.

My partner took me into the ladies bathroom, which is very ornate, and sports a mannequin dressed in a 1920’s jazz outfit. Where else do you find a bidet in a restaurant these days, and what are you supposed to do with it?

Table

The table is expertly set, with beautiful, delicately looking cutlery and decent glasses. The side table of equal hight is a nice detail, and turns out to be very useful in light of the wine service.

But beware, the booths are to be avoided if you are somewhat bigger (because of one’s culinary exploits) and/or have a bad back.

They use beautiful cutlery. It looks small, but in light of the size of the portions it actually works out well. As with every other tasting menu, tableware is very different across the dishes, but suits each individual dish well.

Upon arriving, standard restaurant range Schott Zwiesel glasses are on the table, which is better than in most top restaurants, but the rims are still too thick for my liking. After a bit of prodding they bring out proper Riedels (NOT the restaurant range) and at the end of the evening, if the wine warrants it, you can lay your hands on the Sommelier range. Moral of this story: you won’t find yourself drinking the once-in-your-lifetime-wine-find out of substandard glasses.

It seems we were there on the first day of the new tasting menu, so the actual menus look new and fresh.

Menu and wine

The menu, for a change, oozes Belle Époque elegance. Even the font is right. And the paper feels velvety. Chantel took the effort to write down in the greatest amount of detail what the ingredients of the dish are, and what her inspiration was. Germain then added a description of each accompanying wine (if you take the wine pairing, of which there are two levels: ‘Enthusiast’ with local wines and ‘Connoisseur’ with international ones; I recommend that everyone takes the latter since the pairing is perfect).

The clever thing about writing it down is that 1) the staff can read it as many times as they need to also know what is going on (but don’t worry, later it emerges that all of them are superb and DO know what is going on) and 2) the need to ask questions by patrons is vastly reduced. All you need to know is there in front you.

They offer three tasting menus: Petite, Discovery and Grande Dégustation. The first two consist of elements of the latter, and on the first page of the menu the three options are very clearly laid graphically. The number of dishes is 7, 9 and 12 respectively.

All the dishes make sense together and are inspired by the CONCEPT of Spring, and not so much by specific Spring ingredients. Fortunately no attempts are made to fuse different styles from around the world, but solidly European inspired cooking. I can see Escoffier having done this in this day and age — his elaborateness but with a much lighter twist.

The Spring 2014 Menu seems to be inspired by moods, memories, the surroundings and travel inspirations; at least that is what Chantel wants us to believe. Maybe misguided, but I seem to detect some Klimt influences — Sunflower Spring, First Kiss, anyone else? Anyway, to me it all seems authentic and refreshing, different from some other prized restaurants around Johannesburg that rest on their laurels and never really give you an idea of what they are trying to tell through their tasting menus.

The wine list and cellar our out of this world. The wine collections is so vast, so unique, and so NOT pretentious. The reason some wines are very expensive is not because they want to impress the wrong sort of patrons (the nouveau rich bling crowd) but simply because they have had them for so long, and world prices have gone up.

That said, at R3,200 the 2003 Château d’Yquem (375ml) is practically a steal given that realistically you would be paying between R2,000 and R2,500 in a wine store in Europe. Had it been on the wine list at R6,000, I would have found it normal, but NOT bought it. There is some intelligence in the pricing of the wines in that they do not apply a fixed percentage mark-up but rather a reasonable amount in Rands. This is very interesting for serious wine drinkers: for once you can have outstanding, rare-to-find wines, at ‘reasonable’ prices.

Also very clever is that they import their own wines for the international wine pairing menu, mostly directly from the producers. That way, they avoid the wholesale mark-ups, and serve very interesting wines (but not well known) at very attractive prices. Very well worth it.

The class of Germain shines through in how he takes you through the cellar and talks about the crown jewels without ever trying to sell them or giving the impression you are wasting his time. At R37,000 per bottle, we both know that the 1982 Mouton Rothschild will only ever be purchased by a Russian oligarch or BEE tenderpreneur, and in both instances it would be a waste of this 100/100 Parker wine. Real wine lovers actually talk more about wine than they drink it, and this superb sommelier knowingly lets his guests indulge, and partakes, in this utterly senseless passtime. Simply delightful.

Service: summary

We arrived on the second day of their new season opening. There were very few other diners for lunch on this Saturday.

The wait staff blew me away. They are courteous, professional and they know their stuff. When I argued with one of them that the pea puree with my rainbow trout had to be made with a PacoJet, she told me NO (she knew what a PacoJet is!), explaining me how it is done (first pureeing, then pushing through a sieve), proving me utterly wrong. Where else do you find such confident and knowledgeable waiters?

My partner felt rushed at first, but I had to remind her that starting a 12-course tasting menu at 14:00 is a surefire way of putting the kitchen (that has to prep for evening service) under pressures. I, on the contrary, felt the pace absolutely spot on.

Only once did there seem to be a hiccup. When the sommelier came to top up the wine for the lobster course, and apologise for the delay did we realise another course should have arrived by now. Well, an extra glass of wine was welcome given that no inconvenience was experienced. Some recovery there!

Nice details: waiters come with small trays to replace your cutlery. How stylishly outdated.

In short, service is excellent because of Germain’s presence. His hawkish surveying of the dining room betrays that his responsibilities extend beyond pouring wine. Trained at La Tour d’Argent in the 1970s (when it still had three Michelin stars), he brings a wealth of experience regarding the clock-work operations of a fine establishment.

Food

The dishes as described on the menu find their way onto the plate, but not in a way that you expect. And that is a consequence of you creating a picture in your mind beforehand as a result of Chantel’s evocative descriptions. The discrepancy between expectation and reality is therefore rather interesting.

The food was prepared to exacting technical specifications, all the more impressive given the ‘sparse’ kitchen equipments. No Thermomix, no water baths, no PacoJets. A very traditional kitchen with very traditional equipment (a big LaCanche stove) and lots of copper pots from Dehilleren in Paris. I only saw ISI syphons and a dehydrator as modern tools. Very impressive.

The layering in each dish is spectacular, and with almost every dish there is a gentle unfolding of flavours. Take for example the carrot jelly, puree and orange blossom yoghurt cream with rosettes of pickled carrots.

All the dishes together provide a true kaleidoscope of taste experiences. You feel like you are in one of those Samsung handset adverts, where the protagonist slowly walks and the surroundings constantly change, without seeming to upset the wanderer: now a city, then the beach, in the meadows, on the farm.

There is a sensual lightness to all the dishes and the menu overall.

The only thing that did not work for me was the foie gras with the butternut foam. The liver does not stand up to the foam (although we were spooning the foam out of the bowl later), but a sliver of toast added to the foie grass will ‘break’ the dish, and if they ever do it, I will claim credit for it. Please note, we are nitpicking now.

Random Palates is a new feature we do here at Qorkzcru to help you discover more about your wine. Here’s the way it works, we take individuals who have no experience in the wine industry and we pour them wine without telling them anything about it. A completely blind pour from one of the wines sold in the Qorkz Marketplace. We then take it a step further and ask them to taste the wine with four different foods. We discuss and get their feedback then we share with you to help you further determine if this wine is right for you.

First Up, The Players

WHAT SCENTS DO YOU SMELL?

Raja — I smell chocolate, vanilla, and I know it sounds strange, but a hint of banana

Stefania — I smell black pepper and blackberries.

CAN YOU SMELL OR TASTE THE ALCOHOL?

Stefania — I can smell and taste the alcohol

Raja — I can smell it but I can’t taste it

WHAT FRUIT/BERRY FLAVORS DO YOU TASTE?

Raja — I definitely taste blueberry, plums and like a cherry syrup flavor up front and blackberries on the finish

Stefania — I taste rasberries. Definitely rasberries.

WHAT OTHER FLAVORS DO YOU TASTE?

Stefania — There is a spice there, maybe pepper? I can’t place it.

Raja — I don’t taste any additional flavors but I notice the tannins.

DOES THIS WINE HAVE ANY VEGETAL NOTES?

Raja — No. I don’t taste any.

Stefania — No. Not at all.

Winemaker Tasting Notes

“Deep purple in color, a seductive nose of violets, this blockbuster offers a mouthful of boysenberries, blueberries, and blackberries and finishes with chocolate notes. Stands up well to pork, game, or beef but soft enough to pair with chocolate or mixed berries” — Qorkz.com

DOES THIS WINE PAIR WELL WITH THE PLUM?

Stefania — I could eat peaches and plums with this wine all day. This is delicious!

Raja — I love the wine with the plum!

DOES THIS WINE PAIR WELL WITH THE DUBLINER CHEESE?

Raja — I think the cheese stands up well to the tannin

Stefania — Delicious with the cheese because both the cheese and wine flavors stand out. One isn’t overpowering

DOES THIS WINE PAIR WELL WITH THE STEAK?

Stefania — This wasn’t my favorite pairing. I think the wine is too strong for the steak

Raja — I would say these aren’t a match. They were okay together but don’t compliment one another like the plum did.

DOES THIS WINE PAIR WELL WITH THE CHOCOLATE?

Raja — Again, I think it was just okay with the chocolate. Definitely more with the cheese and plums.

Stefania — The chocolate sorta gets lost. I think the wine is too strong for it.

THE VERDICT

WHAT IS YOUR GUESS AS TO THE VARIETAL?

Stefania — I hate this part, this is so hard! It was very fruity so I would guess a Zinfandel?

Raja — I also taste the fruit, so I am guessing Merlot. It tastes like it softened, like it used to be stronger, so I am guessing an older Merlot.

REACTION TO IT BEING PETITE SIRAH

Raja — Oh interesting. I don’t know if I have ever tried that varietal before. It has big fruit flavors. I liked it.

Stefania — Same, it was a first for me as well, but I really liked it.

WOULD YOU CONSIDER BUYING THIS WINE? IF SO, WHAT IS YOUR PRICE ESTIMATE?

Stefania — Yes I would buy this wine. It was bold but without too much of a kick. I would guess it costs $56.00 a bottle.

Raja — Yes I would. There was great balance between the body, tannin, alcohol, and overall flavor. My guess, $59.00 a bottle.

THE ACTUAL PRICE IS $42 A BOTTLE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE VALUE?

Raja — Good deal. I would have thought it would be worth much more, obviously, I thought it was a $60 a bottle wine

Stefania — Oh wow, much cheaper than I expected. Good deal!

HOW WOULD YOU RATE THIS WINE ON A 1–10 SCALE WITH 10 BEING THE BEST WINE YOU HAVE EVER HAD?

Stefania — I would rate it as an 8. I thought it was really good!

Raja — Same, I would rate it as an 8. I enjoyed it.

OVERALL THOUGHTS ON THE WINE?

Stefania — I enjoyed this wine. It fell in the middle for me. It’s the kind of wine that I could have with apps or during dinner. It seems very versatile.

Raja — This is a splurge wine. I would splurge for this wine.",https://medium.com/@qorkzwine/random-palates-57da4ed36d21,[],2015-10-15 05:59:37.016000+00:00,"['Wine', 'Food', 'Wine Tasting']"

CHARLESTON, S.C. — Bernie Sanders South Carolina state director Chris Covert released the following statement on state Sen. Marlon Kimpson’s legislation to pass a $15 minimum wage and comprehensive gun reforms.



“Bernie Sanders’ South Carolina campaign supports state Sen. Marlon Kimpson’s legislation to enact a $15 minimum wage. South Carolinians should unite in demanding a livable wage and serve as an example to the rest of the nation that no American who works 40 hours a week should be forced to live in poverty. Sen. Kimpson’s common-sense proposals to ban assault weapons, strengthen background checks and implement a gun registration system would help address the tragic impact of gun violence on Charleston and keep citizens across South Carolina safe.

My Two Favourite Documentaries with #BernieSanders,"I just thought I would share with folks two of my favourite documentaries staring Bernie Sanders. The reason why I like these documentaries is because Bernie has not changed fundamentally over the 30+ years he has been in office speaking for the Working Class. (links are informational not advertisements)

In my opinion, as a Cultural Activist, the basic thing that has changed is that the American, and indeed the World, Citizenry has awoken to the knowledge that we can sleep no longer. That We are capable of changing the systemic structures in our society. We need and are participating in our political system because We understand that when a small group of people make most of the decisions in our lives Our lives suffer.

Instant, mass, and online communication is preventing those in power from hiding their violence. The near zero marginal cost for this communication is allowing the common human being to research, document, and organize effectively amplifying Our empathy towards each other. This is bringing Our hearts together and helping us redefine 0ur Social Relationships with each other and with nature.

So here we go, the Bernie Sanders’ 1979 Eugene Debs Documentary, I love the fact that Bernie Sanders is the one that speaks the parts of Eugene Debs. Many Americans are not aware how much of our history has been revised, ignored, or buried in plain sight. The video below shows how Bernie thought in 1979 and should provide proof beyond a shadow of a doubt that Bernie is not supported by us, but that Bernie supports the Working Class, he amplifies our voice. His many c-span videos of his work on the Senate and Congressional floor also support my claim.

For more than 150 years the Social struggles against racism, sexism, violence, centralized authority, and corporatism have always been struggles within the Socialist, Marxist, Communist, and Anarchist communities who have always questioned why workers are not the ones that make the decisions about what they produce, how they produce it, and what is done with the profits created from their collective and individual labor. (The previous link is a Session 1 of a 4 session lecture) These questions depending on how they are answered by social institutions and our workplace determine the very fabric of our political, economic, and social agreements. Any one who works less than 8 hours a day should be thankful to Socialists worldwide.

The next video,Devastating Expose on American Journalism and Media Concentration, I will admit is slightly biased against the Corporate GOP Republican Elites and just barely touches on the harm that the Corporate Democratic Party Elites have done to our society, but it does not ignore them. I like this video because it does not need to rely on fringe conspiracy theories that often have some truth, but often lacks integrity in it’s journalistic efforts.

I also was happy to see Congressman Bernie Sanders speaking and being interviewed. His message has not changed, what has changed is obviously the power of online news media to be shared from pocket to pocket/ desk to desk, the effectiveness of independent local news to report on relevant topics to their community, and the creativity allowed through breaking the chains of so called intellectual property rights that allows us to build upon each other’s ideas instead of relying on a private corporation to tell us what Our ideas are. This video also makes it clear what we are struggling against. However, for those that want encouragement as to how the systemic structures of media has moved enjoy this link to another enlightening documentary that shows how We have changed the world through using social media for the good of humankind.

We are organizing in our communities,

We are changing the very ideas of what media is,

We are creating the world anew,

We are giving voice to the unheard,

We are protecting those bound by chains of fear, greed, and control,

We are remembering our common struggles, our common dreams,

We are sharing our new stories,

We are creative, peaceful, cooperative,

Expect Bernie Sanders to help our visions for a new future,

Expect love, wisdom, and change.",https://medium.com/@ernestrando/my-two-favourite-documentaries-with-berniesanders-35a215a32b66,['Ernest Rando'],2015-12-27 21:43:57.021000+00:00,"['Bernie Sanders', 'Anonymous', 'Activism']"
Why the NGP VAN model has been awesome for democracy (and how it could be more awesome),"Why the NGP VAN model has been awesome for democracy (and how it could be more awesome) Dan Ancona Dec 23, 2015·10 min read

There has been a ton written about #VANghazi so far. I started writing this for publication but it got a bit long, so I’ve given it a quick edit, broken it up into four parts and posted it here. If the conversation is still going in January, I’ll revisit revising and publishing it then.

Here’s the best writing about VANghazi so far:

Will Conaway, NationBuilder: Why the NGP VAN model hurts democracy (Medium)

Josh Hendler, former DNC: Why The Bernie Breach Isn’t About Technology, And What’s At Stake (Medium)

David Atkins, CA Activist: An Explanation of What Bernie Sanders Staffers Actually Did and Why It Matters (Washington Monthly)

Dave Dayen, Journalist: The real scandal in the Bernie/DNC feud is the one nobody is talking about (Salon)

Earlier this week I had the strange feeling of waking up and checking my social media feeds to find very large numbers of people discussing a topic that has consumed large amounts of my life but, before this week, has seemed utterly inaccessibly nerdy: voter file technology and the rules by which campaigns and parties provide them. The suspension of the Sanders’ campaign access to the national voter file system called the VAN by the DNC has now been a multi day issue and even came up in the debate.

There seems to be some consensus on this issue fizzling out, but here’s why I think it’s important enough that I’m up late writing something about it two days before Christmas: I believe getting this right is critical for the future of the Democratic Party and the progressive movement — and even US democracy itself, given the participation crisis of 47 million (and rising) voters not showing up for off year elections. And contrary to the arguments being made, the party, vendors and the broader movement are doing a pretty good job of it despite the rough sledding this week.

In part I of this article, I’ll look at some of the technical and policy arguments being waged against VAN, and in part II I’ll talk about the situation in California where the party has chosen to use a different voter file system, provided by Political Data, Inc. (PDI)

A bit about my background and biases: I’ve been a software developer for over twenty years, and from 2007 to 2010 I was the California VAN administrator for a small shop called California VoterConnect, and then for a few months afer that working for TargetSmart Communications. I haven’t made a wooden nickel from voter file work since I moved on from TargetSmart in 2011, and while I still follow it and I am active in the civic engagement space, I’m not planning on getting back into data, so I have zero financial incentive for any of this. And I think both Sanders and Clinton would be outstanding presidents; I donated a few bucks to Sanders after the story broke out of frustration with a perceived pattern of Democratic party insiders pulling this kind of thing every four years.

My overall theory of change is cribbed from Joe Trippi’s great book about the Dean campaign, The Revolution Will not Be Televised. Trippi argues that we’re in a slow transition from the top-down, broadcast, money dominated system, to a more networked, participatory and social system. If this hypothesis is true — and I hope it is, since it’s hard to have much hope for American democracy otherwise — then data systems and how they are made available is a critical issue to get right.

But I heard VAN sucks

I have enormous respect for both David Dayen and David Atkins, who both have written widely circulated pieces about this. Unfortunately they’ve made some claimes that are contrary to my experience as both a field organizer, voter file provider and application developer.

David Dayen’s writeup on salon.com claims that:

“What’s important for Democratic campaigns is not the software, but the underlying data. Anyone can serve that data and give campaign tools to slice and dice it.”

And David Atkins claims in his Washington Monthly piece:

“The first thing to understand is that NGPVAN is a creaky voter database system that looks, and feels like it was put together in the 1990s.”

Additionally, Will Conway, an employee of NationBilder (another competing system organizing tool that includes a voter file, which is nonpartisan, but signed the biggest political technology deal with Republican state parties and is currently powering the Trump campaign) writes:

“…a piece of campaign technology broke because it’s bad. The reason the software is bad is not because the developers at NGP VAN are in some way inferior — it’s because there is no incentive to improve their product.

The VAN5 launch video and this analysis of NationBuilder’s data quality are both good rebuttals to these arguments, but I have four more lines of disagreement based on my experience:

First, what VAN, PDI, and NationBuilder all do is technically fairly difficult to do right, but scaling out to the incredible amount of traffic that VAN handles around election day is particularly challenging. I know, because I’m one of not very many people who have both run a campaign data operation and written software for the kinds of tools that can power them. David and David, both of you are invited over to my place in Oakland to talk database architecture and scaling performance next time you’re around if you genuinely thinks it’s so easy that any old firm can do this. We can run some queries, do a little SQL, talk about forecasting infrastructure needs for election day loads. It’ll be great.

Second, while it’s true the data is important, the capabilities of the software are absolutely critical and shape the scope of the kind of field campaign that can be run. More about this shortly.

Third, there is absolutely competition to the VAN. The number of organizations attempting to jump all over this — some of them with borderline ridiculous spin that Will from NationBuilder’s piece included, claiming that NGP has no reason to innovate — should be enough evidence of this. There are a number of different systems available that the DNC and progressive organizations could switch to at any time. Organizer is an outstanding and recently developed app that works with NGPVAN and other back ends. While not a direct competitor, Catalist functions as a sort of data repository for progressive groups and after a somewhat rocky beginning. The DNC and large numbers of progressive organizations pick VAN largely because it does things no other system can do.

Fourth, there is no reason to believe that a more market based approach would produce a better outcome than the more-or-less socialized approach the Democratic party is currently taking. There’s even an existing alternative approach that seems to indicate it would be vastly worse: the famously chaotic data infrastructure on the GOP side.

OK, maybe the VAN is good, but is it more like a monopoly like AT&T, or more like infrastructure, like roads and bridges?

But the question remains: is the political data market more like the market for artisinal chocolate, where lots of small vendors are a good thing for consumers, or is it more like the market for roads and bridges: infrastructure that everyone shares but is expensive and tricky to build and maintain?

I believe strongly it’s the latter. Of course VAN isn’t doing everything right, but I believe there’s a preponderance of evidence that the approach the DNC and VAN have taken by centralizing this service has been a huge structural advantage.

The main counterarguments revolve around VAN being a centralized point of failure. It could have a technical failure, or it could have a policy failure, where party insiders foul something up. The Sanders campaign fiasco last week was arguably a mixture of both.

But here’s the thing: compared to the technical failures on the Republican side — remember Romney’s much hyped turnout tool, Orca, which crashed in a flaming mess on election day in 2012? — the technical issues on the VAN side have been relatively trivial. There’s a saying: good software takes ten years. In my experience that’s true for everything from the VAN to the tool I use to dj from my laptop. While I was working at VoterConnect, slow individual queries or systematic performance issues did crop up periodically. But they were always handled quickly and aggressively by VAN support. It was to this day the single best supported system I’ve ever used, and their rapid turnaround quickly became legendary among our users and campaigns.

That being said, I always encouraged campaigns to have backup lists stored before the last weekend of the election. Any complex technical system is vulnerable to failure. Vendors that make contrary claims should be regarded with deep suspicion.

And on the policy side, what’s amazing about this moment is that there are thousands of people watching the Democratic Party and what it does. They can’t pull this kind of crap anymore. I’m far from the only one who cares enough to stay up late writing up detailed arguments because lots of people now get why this is important.

In the initial wave of spin a lot of my friends said, “screw the Democratic party, they’re so corrupt, Bernie should quit.” But that’s exactly the wrong approach. We’re just now getting to the point where the corruption is becoming visible. The solution isn’t to abandon the party, it’s to get more involved and love it harder, even while admitting there is a hell of a lot more work to do.

Why software (not just data) really matters: VAN vs PDI in California

The PDI vs VAN situation in California, viewed through the lens of the organization I built, California VoterConnect, is an excellent illustration of the importance of the software itself, not just the data. VoterConnect was started in 2007 by some of the sharpest and most strategic progressive donors in California, with Steve Phillips taking the lead on shaping the strategy. They were enormously frustrated with PDI and felt that outsider campaigns, particularly those trying to reach racially and ethnically diverse communities, were priced out of the market.

Our first topic was to do a full technical evaluation of both VAN and PDI. VAN had tremendous, overwhelming technical advantages over PDI: it was vastly faster, had (even at the time) super flexible and granular data sharing capacities, and was cheaper and available and under a much more flexible license that would let us share data between groups. On top of all that, they only worked with progressive and Democratic groups.

After the technical evaluation, when we described our organization’s mission and proposed structure to PDI, their response was succinct: “We don’t think there’s anything interesting here for us.” The contrast with VAN’s founders, who flew to California to talk through our strategy, couldn’t have been more stark. Sure, they wanted our business. But why didn’t PDI?

The primary benefit of the VAN — it’s ease of use — became apparent over the next few years. I was able to go to a nonprofit or small campaign doing voter contact in underserved areas, do a two or four hour training, and leave their team with access to the tools and capacity to run their own field campaign from top to bottom, with only minimal ongoing assistance from me. They could set their own targets, pull their own lists and print them or send them to mobile devices, then put the results back in. I did several trainings to roomfuls of organizers through a translator where I was the only one speaking English.

I have a number of theories as to why CA Dems still haven’t switched to VAN. Part of it was my own fault: VoterConnect’s primary and really only mission was to stay laser focused on delivering voter data to organizations that were serving underrepresented communities. We focused on executing towards that goal and were tremendously successful, including getting to breakeven revenue in three years. Persuading the party appartus to switch never rose above a tertiary goal. But for reasons that were made largely above my pay grade, we ended up selling the project to another firm that eventually shut it down.

But the main reason is that it hasn’t mattered as much as in other states. We are as far from a Presidential battleground as you can get. And for most downticket races, traditional top down field operations with one or two data managers at the top and everyone working off their lists works just fine: there’s no urgent need for a distributed approach. In many places, even more rickety “cosmetic field” operations, that are really just checkboxes for campaign staff but result in very limited volunteer engagement, are plenty to win given the outsized Dem majorities in most places.

But there’s still a lost opportunity here. California should be leading the change from broadcast to participatory politics. Instead, we’re a forgotten backwater.

Virginia 2008: What the Participatory Future Could Look Like

My wife and I were in Northern Virginia two weekends before the election in late October of 2008. The VoterConnect VAN was humming providing data for 140 campaigns across California, but my favorite Aunt had died and I couldn’t bear the thought of not being with my family. We attended her funeral on Saturday and on Sunday we did my aunt would have encouraged us to do if: we ventured out to join the swing state Obama field campaign.

What we found shocked us. We went to four different field offices — the energy was palpable and electric in all of them. The first three kept sending us to smaller and smaller neighborhood offices. When we got to the fourth one, the neighborhood leader who couldn’t stop grinning told us, “You’re never going to believe this. But we’re out of turf. We’re… I think we’re actually done.”

Ordinarily a field campaign that reaches perhaps 10% of the voters in a given area could be considered a raging success. This kind of coverage was basically unheard of. Of course this level of energy didn’t come from VAN: it came from eight years of Bush and an exciting chance for change in Obama.

But having the VAN was what turned that organization from a seething mob of political potential energy into an actual electoral force. It wouldn’t have been possible to do this nearly as effectively with a more difficult, slower, more centralized system like PDI, even if they had been able to handle the incredible technical challenge of scaling their system to handle that kind of national load.

The feeling of that energy, that level of mass participation has stuck with me since then. Eight years later, I remember the expression on that organizer’s face like it was ten minutes ago. That’s how democracy should feel. That’s how it should work. The data matters, but the tools absolutely matter too, and the DNC and NGPVAN have — this recent debacle notwithstanding — done a largely terrific job moving us towards that future so far.

The biggest single problem facing American democracy right now isn’t Donald Trump. It’s our lack of Reflective Democracy. We’re not going to reach the more than 47 million voters that are threatening to go missing again in 2018 by running TV ads at them or even through Facebook. Would a distributed army of engaged activists going door to door be a better bet? Maybe, but if so, the leadership for finding out if that future is possible is not coming from California. But the long-term investments in VAN by the DNC and state parties outside California may yet have laid the foundation for it.",https://medium.com/@danancona/why-the-ngp-van-model-has-been-awesome-for-democracy-and-how-it-could-be-more-awesome-43e96ce0fdc6,['Dan Ancona'],2015-12-23 22:13:44.756000+00:00,"['Politics', 'Bernie Sanders', 'Data']"

"Why The Bernie Breach Isn’t About Technology, And What’s At Stake","Why The Bernie Breach Isn’t About Technology, And What’s At Stake

As someone who has waded deeply in this space and has friends on every side, it’s been hard to watch the DNC/Bernie/Hillary/NGPVAN brouhaha unfold. I led the DNC data program for several years starting in 2005, and then served as the Technology Director from 2010–11. While at the DNC, I was part of a team that created the programs at the core of today’s debate: a uniform agreement with state-parties for data sharing, a national contract with the VAN (now NGPVAN), and Presidential candidate access.

There’s one piece of context required to understand the meaningful implications of the current debate. And it’s not about what Bernie’s team covertly did, or institutional bias on behalf of the Party.

It’s about trust.

The Democratic Party’s technological lead over Republicans has been much heralded and not seriously contested until recently. NGPVAN, to be sure, is one of the reasons for that lead. But it hasn’t been just about one tool. An ecosystem of technologists and companies has made the Democrat’s advantage possible (Blue State Digital, NGPVAN, TargetSmart, Catalist, and more recently, Civis, Blue Labs, etc.) Each of these companies has provided mostly complementary solutions, which make the technological lead possible.

One leading reason for the advantage, however, has been been the widespread adoption and use of the Party’s national voter file tool among candidates. Republicans have simply never seen this level of use. As recently as June, there was an open spat between the Koch brothers and the RNC about what platform candidates should be using.

The story of how Democrats got to a unified national voter file is a strange and twisty one. Before 2007, every state Democratic Party had a separate voter file system. While there were agreements signed to periodically share data, the State Party’s voter file and the DNC’s voter file were not the same thing. During this time, fights between State Parties and candidates over voter file access were plentiful.

But in 2007, there was a bureaucratic development, which would turn out to have long-lasting implications. The vast majority of State Parties signed agreements to trade data back and forth with the DNC, and most critically, they both agreed to use one joint voter file system. This wasn’t merely because of better technology (though it was in part). It was because the state parties decided that while they would be giving up some power, they trusted the DNC to be stewards of the data. As the data director, I often complained that my job was a political one, getting state chairs on the phone and striking up a partnership.

This isn’t a story about how that one moment changed everything. It was a step among many others over the years, many of which involved the amazing work of the Obama data and analytics teams. This is a story about how the Democratic Party’s technological advantage is about more than tech, it’s about candidates and state parties trusting the national party. And it was this single fact, a unified database, and a somewhat unified party apparatus, which gave us a key advantage over Republicans.

So, what?

It means that the stakes are higher than the political fight of the day between Bernie and Hillary. The DNC being seen as a fair arbiter and steward of the data is critical to this continued advantage over Republicans. If the DNC is no longer that trusted broker, we might see candidates using third party systems. This risks the Party’s access to valuable data collected by campaigns, especially during a Presidential.

It’s hard for me not to sympathize with the impossible situation the DNC data team has been placed in. They must live up to a strict agreement, protect the sanctity of the data, and provide an immense amount of customer support. But now that we’re past the immediate crisis, it’s worthwhile for all parties to look towards ways to mend fences and build trust at every level.

It helped us win before and will be needed to win again.",https://medium.com/@joshhendler/why-the-bernie-breach-isn-t-about-technology-and-what-s-at-stake-c383ee7b840a,['Josh Hendler'],2015-12-19 22:21:05.789000+00:00,"['Politics', '2016 Election', 'Bernie Sanders']"
"1,000 South Carolina Women Endorse Bernie Sanders for President","1,000 South Carolina Women Endorse Bernie Sanders for President

CHARLESTON, S.C. — In a signal of the growing support for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign in South Carolina, more than 1,000 women across the state have endorsed his candidacy.

“We are thrilled to have such broad enthusiasm among local women for Sen. Sanders,” State Director Christopher Covert said Thursday. “Sanders has fought for women’s rights and economic fairness throughout his life and the support in South Carolina reflects the national movement of American women joining our campaign.”

Christale Spain, the South Carolina Director of Political Outreach, said that “as a black woman and a single mother, it was crucial to support a candidate who has demonstrated a commitment to advocating for me and the issues that impact my community. Sen. Sanders has been a champion of civil rights and economic equality for women for thirty years, and I am proud to endorse him.”

Dr. Gloria Tinubu, the first African-American woman in the state to win the Democratic nomination for Congress, believes that “Sanders is in the tradition of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who lead our parents and grandparents through one of the most challenging times in our nation’s history. Like President Roosevelt, Bernie is fighting to protect our democratic way of life and our four freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.”

A new Clemson University Palmetto Poll shows that nearly one in two South Carolina Democratic primary voters remain undecided about whom to support in the February primary.",https://medium.com/@SouthCarolinaforBernieSanders/1-000-south-carolina-women-endorse-bernie-sanders-for-president-40385aa1f558,[],2015-12-27 04:33:36.244000+00:00,"['Politics', 'Bernie Sanders', 'South Carolina']"
I stand with Bernie!,"Like most of you that take the time to read this, I’m an independent guy. I relish my independent lifestyle, the independence of my being. I go way out of my way to avoid groups of people, because I’m independent. Naturally, I’m an independent voter. I don’t caucus and rarely enjoy mingling. And for the past 10 presidential elections, this has served me just fine. I watch from the sidelines and place my vote in the 11th hour.

Problem is, for most of those elections I have despised everything about them. The process, the people, the groups. All smoke and mirrors, deception, lies. Most of the promises are never met. To his credit, Obama woke me up. So I’m paying more attention. In spite of his herculean efforts, never has the world been so fricked up. Never have our political processes been so fricked up. Yet amidst this darkness, the Fear and all its minions: greed, intimidation and deceit, there is light in Bernie Sanders. Truth, light and transparency. It’s really hard to miss. And most importantly, unlike our reliance on Obama to get somethings changed, Bernie says he can’t do it. Only we, the grass-roots movement rising up to put him in power, can do it. And thus, for the first time in my voting life, I’ve left the sidelines. I’m on the field. I stand with Bernie.

My friends are in, but idle.

And there in lies the problem. Sure, I’ll help, they say. But they gasp when I tell them that to do so, they must first register as a Democrat, because Colorado, and the location of my city of independence, require a Caucus in order to cast one’s vote for Bernie in order to avoid the DNC default of Hillary. And even more frightening is the fact that none of the Republicans of late can beat Bernie, but Hillary can. So we must get folks out to the March 1st Colorado caucuses in order to do so. And they only let registered Democrats into the Dem caucuses to vote. And while temporarily changing your status to Democrat from Independent is relatively effortless, it MUST BE DONE before the end of the 2015 year. Give or take 10 days from now, you will no longer be able to do so. And I know come mid February, everybody will be so fricking fed up with the cluster frick we call the political process, that they’ll all be aligned with Bernie’s messages. But for most of my friends, they won’t have made the 12/31/2015 deadline and thus, sadly, they won’t be able to help.

So I’m spending my Holidays getting the word out. Not what I’d rather be doing. But what I, for the first time in my politically-numb life, feel like I must.

So guys and gals, you’re like me and you despise having to play the political game in order to get a desired political outcome. It is what it is. So, repeat out loud the Bernie Independent Manifesto (below), then click the link at the bottom and sign your name to that Manifesto. Then click the other link, and with a few brief key stokes, you too will be (albeit temporarily) a Democrat.

Bernie Independent Manifesto

In front of God and Everybody, I hereby protest the outrageous requirement that I must surrender my otherwise God given right to an affiliation of my own choosing or the intentional lack thereof. This I must do, in order for me to affirm my Presidential Candidate preference in the Primary Election for Bernie Sanders, against the likes of Hillary Clinton. Yea, I must attach to the very broken system of corruption and buffoonery that I so despise and hence have so far avoided by not affiliating thusly. Yet, hovering far above this sea of political horse shit, there is Bernie. Thus I will willingly give up my political autonomy, by temporarily becoming a Democrat, for the expressed purposes of rallying to Bernie’s cause in the upcoming Primary Caucus election. I will participate in the system I so absolutely abhor, in hopes of achieving a change in this great nation, one that must eventually lead to the rectification of our political process. I do so publically, and I hereby fully intend and announce, that I will return to my original non-Democratic party status or other affiliation of choice, at the completion of said election.

The Game Plan for Winning and Governing with Intelligence and Integrity

Robert David Steele

Now that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has made it clear that it is merely an extension of the Hillary Clinton campaign, and all too willing to sacrifice Bernie Sanders over a brief indiscretion due to a security flaw that the Sanders campaign itself had flagged multiple times to the DNC, the time has come for Bernie Sanders to get real. He was not going to win the DNC nomination before, and he will not win it now.

America is unhinged — from Griftopia [1] to Double Government [2], all the checks and balances are gone. A two-party duopoly that has rejected — nine times — national legislation to assure electoral integrity and open the ballot to independents and small parties, at least for federal offices — is the enabling factor. [3] A country whose institutions — from academia to labor unions to the media to religions — refused to challenge 935 lies [4] leading to an elective and ruinous war on Iraq, is now also near cultural, economic, and social ruin. The unemployment rate is 23%, not 5% (U1) or 10% (U6), but our institutions — particularly Forbes and MSNBC as well as the Wall Street Journal, Business Week, and others, refuse to get real.

Politically, the two-party tyranny had anointed Jeb Bush on the Right and Hillary Clinton the left — both representing dynasties too easily connected to drugs and money, while suffering the bluster of Donald Trump and the platitudes of Bernie Sanders. There can be no question about the wisdom of Tom Friedman’s declaration, that none of the existing candidates is attractive. [5] There has never been a better opportunity for an Independent candidate to make a bid for the presidency. Fully 60% of all Americans hold the two-party duopoly in disdain and believe an alternative is needed. [6]

Now that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has made it clear that it is merely an extension of the Hillary Clinton campaign, and all too willing to sacrifice Bernie Sanders over a brief indiscretion due to a security flaw that the Sanders campaign itself had flagged multiple times to the DNC, the time has come for Bernie Sanders to get real. He was not going to win the DNC nomination before, and he will not win it now.

If Sanders were to run as an Independent, he must avoid the assumption that merely winning the presidency on the strength of televised debates and a traditional campaign, will suffice. It will not. As long as Congress is in the grip of a two-party duopoly, where Members no longer write or read legislation, whose votes are sold in bloc form to combinations of 40+ billionaires, [7] any President, however well-intentioned, will be very weak.

If Sanders decides to run for real rather than as a placeholder (placemat) for Clinton, he must first restore integrity to the US electoral system, such that he not only wins as an Independent, ideally with a bi-partisan ticket and a coalition cabinet announced in advance; but is also able to govern in partnership with a Congress in which the 20–30 seats being vacated — i.e. without defending incumbents — are taken by small party and Independent candidates — and perhaps some Democrats and Republicans — who make one pledge: to represent their constituents, not caucus with either of the controlling parties, and vote on the basis of ethical evidence-based decision-support. Creating a swing vote independent of the two-party duopoly is the fastest way to restore Article 1 of the Constitution and integrity to the legislative process. This is the other half of “independence,” of being able to govern with intelligence and integrity.

There are seven specific things Sanders could do in the Fall of 2015 in order to not only be assured of winning, and also be assured that the next federal government is inherent honest, governing with intelligence and integrity.

01 Call for a “Virtual” Article V Constitutional Convention. Reach out in a most unorthodox manner and invite Mark Levin [8] to chair and organize the event. Inspire an online and Living Room Conversation [9] process from the county-level up that ultimately sends eight people from each of the 50 states — one each from each of the eight information tribes (academic, civil society, commerce, government, law enforcement, media, military, and non-government/non-profit). There are at least five amendments that need strengthening or revision.

1st Religion & Freedom of Expression

2nd Right to Bear Arms

12th Electoral College

14th Birthright

17th State Appointment of Senators

There are thirteen arguments — an entire book has been written on this — central to defining and inspiring all US citizens that could be discussed as part of this national conversation — this is the substance no candidate today is competent or caring enough to address: [10]

Who Is a Person?

2. Who is an American?

3. The Role of Faith

4. The Limits of Individualism

5. What Can We Know and Say?

6. Who Judges the Law?

7. Debt and Dollar

8. Local versus National Authority

9. Presidential Power

10. The Terms of Trade

11. War and Diplomacy

12. The Environment

13. A Fair, “More Perfect” Union

A “virtual” Article V Constitutional Convention will “air out” in a most constructive way where we all are on the essentials, and will illuminate the possible outcome of a “real” Article V Constitutional Convention should 34 of the 50 states choose to demand a convention. Absent adjustments, I fear the real prospect of a series of state secessions, beginning with Hawaii, followed by Vermont, Alaska, California, and Texas. [11]

02 Host a Workshop on Unemployment. I will not belabor the ignorance of those who refuse to be truthful about unemployment and refer to those of us who are as “unemployment truthers.” The actual unemployment rate in the USA today is no less than 23% [12] and could be as high at 40% according to the Congressional Research Service. [13]

03 Raise Funds for and Lead an Electoral Reform Summit. Sanders, ideally backed up by Tom Steyer and others, to whom I have sent a Memorandum also posted online, [14] and ideally also the Mars Family of Virginia, as well as Lady Lynn Rothschild of New Jersey, has the power to force through — in partnership with Occupy and AdBusters — an Electoral Reform Act of 2016. Imagine an event in January 2016 that includes all past candidates for president as well as major thought leaders — issuing a Statement of Demand that brings back to our process the 100 million eligible voters who chose not to vote in 2012, and includes a fast-track registration process for the 52.7 million unmarried women, people of color, and youth eligible to vote, who have not registered to vote. Show the 39% who identify as Independents today, [15] and the growing number of new voters registering as No Party Preference (NPP), that they have the power to force through an Electoral Reform Act of 2016 that will at a minimum enable Independents, Constitution, Green, and Libertarian candidates to win the 20–30 seats in Congress that are being vacated in 2016. Once organized this larger group could make a deal with the incumbent Members — pass the Act and you get one term to break with your party and start representing your constituents. [16]

Here are the elements of the Act for discussion — 12 distinct but essentially integrated fixes. The Most Holy Father has called for electoral reform [17] — his staff has a copy of the 12 points. Can you think of a more powerful combination than Sanders, perhaps with Elizabeth Warren or a strong Latina if not, Tom Steyer, the Mormons, and the Pope — and the massive engaged public they are capable of mobilizing?

04 Sponsor a Name Your Cabinet Web Site. “Fantasy Football” is big business. Why not a “Fantasy Cabinet” as a basis for emerging citizens into thinking about who — irrespective of party affiliation — they would most trust for each of the Cabinet positions? Should some positions be abolished? Are other positions needed? Why not harness the collective intelligence of the public while using this as a means of re-engaging the public in public governance? [18]

05 Sponsor a Balanced Budget Web Site. What would a balanced budget look like in which true cost of all policies and practices were fully documented (US Government waste is known to be roughly 50% across all domains from Agriculture to Defense to Education to Energy to Health)? Sanders could even invite Ben & Jerry to lead a national conversation on this topic. This would among many benefits exposure the ignorance of all other presidential candidates who do not understand that giving more money to a corrupt military-industrial complex is like pouring gasoline on a fire. The infantry, 4% of the force, takes 80% of the causalities and gets 1% of the budget. The other 99% of the budget is spent on pork that kills. We need a 450 ship Navy, an air-mobile Army, and a long-haul Air Force and we can create such a force while still cutting 30–40% in waste from our Department of Defense as now managed. [19]

All of the presidential candidates now running lack credibility when it comes to discussing what the threats are to America the Beautiful. Immigration is not a threat and China did not take our jobs — it is US business leaders, enabled by corrupt US political leaders, who have systematically refused to respect the laws against paying illegal aliens, while exporting our manufacturing jobs to China without regard to the “true cost” to our country and our communities of disenfranchising — bankrupting — vast swaths of our working class. [20]

There are the ten high-level threats to the USA specifically and humanity generally. [21] The only public figure talking about these threats with intelligence and integrity has been the Pope!

01 Poverty

02 Infectious Disease

03 Environmental Degradation

04 Inter-State Conflict

05 Civil War

06 Genocide

07 Other Atrocities

08 Proliferation

09 Terrorism

10 Transnational Crime

These are the issues that Jesse Gordon is tracking for all the candidates at On the Issues. [22]

Domestic Issues: Civil Rights, Crime, Drugs,Environment, Gun Control, Jobs

Economic Issues: Budget & Economy, Government Reform, Social Security, Tax Reform, Technology & Infrastructure, Welfare & Poverty

International Issues: Energy & Oil, Foreign Policy, Free Trade, Homeland Security, Immigration, War & Peace

Social Issues: Abortion, Corporations, Education, Families & Children, Health Care, Principles & Values

Not a single candidate is offering a coherent, evidence-based, revenue-calculated discussion of these issues. Bombast, buzz words, lies, and platitudes are the order of the day. We need a serious nationwide discussion of all threats, all policies, all issues as a foundation for selecting a new transpartisan executive team and a president who is chosen not on the basis of his or her views on any given issue, but on the basis of being absolutely committed to restoring the integrity of the electoral process and thence of the government, the economy, and our society.

Indeed, the fastest way for Sanders to establish his credibility in relation to national security is to ask the Vice President to lead a Grand Strategy Review such as has not been done since Project Solarium was commissioned by President Eisenhower. I have published a Kindle white paper that could be helpful. [23]

06 Take Over BigBatUSA.org and Raise a Billion Dollars. From a practical business point of view — one that Ross Perot displayed — it makes sense to offer the public a vehicle for buying back its government. I am betting there are 100 million voters out there from across the political spectrum that now see very clearly that the two-party tyranny is in complete betrayal of the public trust. $10 from each is one billion dollars. I fully expect such a site to raise $2 billion if Sanders chooses to champion electoral reform, and forms a coalition on that foundation. This money would fund the Occupation of the home offices and front lawns of every Member refusing to co-sponsor and vote for the Electoral Reform Act of 2016, provide basic income assistance for the unemployed, and help advance Independent and small party campaigns for vacant seats in Congress if the public funding portion of that Act is rejected by the majority. The Electoral Reform Act of 2016 as finally passed may or may not include public funding of all campaigns for federal office — if it does, the balance can be donated to the government fund; if not the balance can be used to create a swing vote. Perhaps more importantly — with a nod of appreciation to Howard Dean, Joe Trippi, and Zepher Teachout who created the Big Bat concept in the first place — it is time we show the US Chamber of Commerce, Wall Street, and the US Supreme Court that people, not billionaires, are sovereign in the USA. Not two million people, which is what Sanders has now, but 120 million or more — THAT is a “Big Bat.”

07 Hire a Catholic Latino Advisor. Now that The Most Holy Father has weighed in on electoral reform [24] — the Franciscan order has the lead in the USA — the time has come to create a grand coalition outside the two-party system, in which youth, single women, and Latinos, as well as prisoners (mostly black) whose vote would be restored by the Electoral Reform Act of 2016 — come together. All of our institutions have failed us; We the People have many legitimate grievances. [25] In my view — I happen to be Latino of a mother born in Colombia — the Latinos and the organizations they have created or dominate — including Voto Latino and the Service Employees International Union as well as the Catholic Church — are ready to lead a renaissance in American political participation. The time has come to displace political parties and put the people — all of the people — back into politics. [26]

Sanders: Trump is ‘Getting Nervous’,"Sanders: Trump is ‘Getting Nervous’

DECEMBER 27, 2015

BURLINGTON, Vt. — Quoting Donald Trump’s assertion that wages in the United States are “too high,” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday said Trump’s attempt to back away from his own words shows that the Republican front-runner is “getting nervous that working families are catching on” to his views.

“Donald Trump says that I’m a liar because I said he believes wages in America are too high. Really?” Sanders said in response to Trump’s assertion on Twitter on Sunday. “This is what CNN reported last Nov. 12,” Sanders added. “Trump insisted on Thursday that the U.S. must keep wages low in order to compete with other countries, one day after he dug in on his assertion that ‘wages are too high’ in America. ‘Whether it’s taxes or wages, if they’re too high we’re not going to be able to compete with other countries,’ Trump said Thursday morning on Fox News. Trump first said he believes wages are ‘too high’ during Tuesday night’s Republican debate.”

“It appears that Mr. Trump is getting nervous that working families are catching on that his policies represent the interests of the billionaire class against almost everyone else. He refuses to support raising the minimum wage. He believes wages are too high and he wants to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the very richest families in America. That’s not an agenda that ‘makes America great.’ It’s just another Republican billionaire wanting to make the very rich richer at the expense of working families.”",https://medium.com/@SouthCarolinaforBernieSanders/sanders-trump-is-getting-nervous-2cde5cefad35,[],2015-12-27 20:13:13.441000+00:00,"['Bernie Sanders', 'Donald Trump', '2016 Election']"
DNC adds fuel to the #Bern,"So I’m sure you’ve heard the recent drama regarding a “data breach” with the Bernie campaign allegedly having access to the Clinton campaign’s voter data.

The breach in question is related to a software called VAN, which you can access yourself at americavotesvan.com. It was reported late Thursday that due to a “glitch”, the Bernie campaign had access to things they shouldn’t have, and they read through things that the Clinton team had painstakingly acquired through manual door-knocking, phone calls, etc. The DNC then accused the Bernie campaign of saving this information, and as a result, with the help of the VAN software vendor, cut off the Bernie team from ALL of the data in VAN- including the data the Bernie team themselves had acquired. In the age of data, this amounts to cutting out the eyes and ears of the biggest grassroots campaign in history. If you’re looking for a way to cripple an insurgent grassroots candidate, this is it.

Facing a court challenge from the Bernie campaign, Debbie Wasserman Schultz (DWS) then relented and gave access back to the campaign shortly after midnight last night. What happened in between the drama and last night was classic Bernie — hundreds of thousands of petitioners calling for the DNC chair to be dismissed, more petitions urging the campaign to get it’s own data back, and research that revealed that the CEO of the software VAN, is a supporter of the Clinton campaign.

It’s obvious that something here stinks. And it stinks bad.

The narrative for months in the Bernie camp has been this — we are fighting against a corrupt political system. Not just the Republican party, but both parties are corrupted by the influence of money and corporate interests. Clinton’s biggest financial supporter is Goldman Sachs, while I’ve donated to the Bernie campaign for the first campaign contribution in my life. The reason Bernie is running, and why he has so much support of real people, is that he alone refuses to engage in Big Money and thinks it is time for the influence of the wealthy to end. This latest fiasco by the DNC will only fuel the fire.

On a casual view from the outside, the game looks rigged. With only six debates, the O’Malley and Bernie campaign have been calling foul since this summer. Fewer debates presumably protect Clinton’s status as a frontrunner — many people haven’t even heard of O’Malley or Bernie. And the timing of the debates is atrocious- the ONLY debate in Iowa was during the Saturday of the Iowa-Michigian State Big Ten Championship game. This next debate is on another Saturday night, right after college kids are done with finals and are traveling home. Compare this to the R’s debate schedule — twice as many debates, and scheduled during the week where people can talk about it the next day. This stinks.

So far, Trump has gained support for playing the media to his own advantage. Say something bombastic, the media criticizes him, he continues his story of being victimized by the media — brilliant. Bernie would be wise to take this moment in the same way- he’s been dogged by the DNC this whole time, and this latest failed attempt only showcases how the DNC is out to get him, and is a pawn of the Clinton campaign.

As the dust settles from this latest turn of events, expect it to energize and galvanize the Bernie team — myself included. I may or may not watch the debate tonight, but I’m at that point now where I #FeeltheBern deep in my heart, and this is only fuel to the fire.",https://medium.com/@coreycooling/dnc-adds-fuel-to-the-bern-60eab865502f,['Corey Cooling'],2015-12-19 18:22:14.986000+00:00,"['Politics', '2016 Election', 'Bernie Sanders']"
The Triumph of 3D Printing,"Are you short? Or tall? Or fat, or thin? Do you want to see your alma mater’s logo on everything? Now your chairs can be just right for you, because there is no reason they should not be tailored specifically to and for you. Today a wealthy man can have a bespoke suit. Tomorrow we can all have a bespoke furniture set, because it will cost nothing more to to customize it.

Eventually, there will be a machine that creates for you, cheaply and quickly, any beautiful object you may desire. Today, this can almost be done — in plastic. Tomorrow it will be done in bronze, or cut from marble, and whatever electronics you desire will be embedded within it at nominal cost.

Tomorrow when you read your child’s favorite book to them at bedtime, you will be able to hand them a sculpture of each of their favorite scenes. The princess and her dragon will be there, glittering in glory, perhaps even ready to take wing — because, why not? Printing a flying toy dragon with integrated motors will be commonplace.

When an earthquake or a fire destroys your home, how long do you think it will take for us to rebuild it? Thirty days? Thirty hours? Thirty minutes?

H.P. Lovecraft wrote in At The Mountains of Madness of a space-faring race that used sculpture and bas-relief in place of writing. We may eventually do the same. Trigonometry will now be explained with a manipulable object. You will see and feel the surface of the function. You will understand the four chambers of the heart better when we hand you one.

3D Printing vs. Other Technologies

Tim O’Reilly once said that he thought computer controlled manufacturing is the real story, of which 3D printing is just a subset. He is right, of course. At TechShop Austin, the 2D laser cutters are more heavily used than the 3D printers. Laser cutters can be similarly humanizing and artful.

But of the CNC milling, laser cutting, and other related making technologies, none of them quite come as close to producing items of stand-alone value. None of them quite changed my way of thinking as much as my experience with 3D printing.

Getting Involved

If you have any interest in this sort of thing do yourself a favor and find a way to borrow or rent the use of a 3D printer and print out a few objects.

This is a great time to become interested in 3D printing. Maker spaces commonly allow professional 3D printers to be shared as part of membership and offer support and community. I have enjoyed TechShop Austin because of the excellent advice and support given by their staff. Alternatively, you can just buy one for your home if you are willing to do some assembly and learning on your own. Here is a small basic model:

A basic model cost less than $500.

If you buy your own, expect to spend a little time tweaking it before your are happy with your prints, and don’t expect to create museum-quality pieces without a lot of extra work.

Every child should be given a chance to hold in their hands things that they designed and made themselves. 3D printing does not replace, but rather augments sculpting, drawing or painting.

We need: artists to design new objects, craftspersons to tailor objects to the human form and to paint and finish objects, engineers to design parts that make machines better, stronger and cheaper.

But we also need a new sort of skill, called simply 3D Printing: we need people willing to just think of how to use this new capability and to invest the modest effort needed to get new things designed, printed, and enjoyed.",https://medium.com/@robertleeread/the-triumph-of-3d-printing-1d4517b5ce3,['Robert L.

As Marcin Wichary explains, it’s because writers tend to write on big screens while readers read on small screens , and the new options should look great on both. Let’s hope so. On with the links — here’s what I learnt yesterday.

On Predicting the Future

I’ve been pretty excited over the last few weeks about what will happen in the coming decades in terms of artificial intelligence and colonising other planets. But this ComputerWorld article from 2008 is a stern reminder that we’re actually pretty bad at predicting the future. Here’s a chunk:

Some changes and new functionality in the laptops we’ll use in 2015 will come about because of significant advances in the materials used to create the devices. Magneclay is just one example. Another example is a change in the plastics used in the notebook case. In fact, by 2015, dropping a notebook might not be the catastrophe it can be today.

Yeah, I think dropping a laptop is still going to be a catastrophe for a few more years.

On Sitting and Standing

Over the past few years I’ve flirted on and off with standing desks. Shortly after I moved to Sweden three years ago, I hacked together a standing desk out of IKEA bits for £136. That desk is still going strong, but every six months or so I swap it from sitting to standing because I’m not quite happy.

The best bet would be a motorised desk that moves up and down like the IKEA Bekant, but then yesterday I spotted a new bit of research that suggests sitting and standing are equally bad for your body. After tracking 5,000 people for 16 years, a team at Exeter University and UCL found:

“Any stationary posture where energy expenditure is low may be detrimental to health, be it sitting or standing,” said Melvyn Hillsdon from Exeter’s sport and health sciences department. “The results cast doubt on the benefits of sit-stand work stations, which employers are increasingly providing to promote healthy working environments.”

So yeah. Maybe a treadmill desk is the answer. But realistically that’s not going to happen in my current apartment. Hmm. Maybe I should just go for more lunchtime walks. Thoughts welcome here.

On 3D Printing

I just finished writing a story for Techradar on the baby that was 3D printed before it was born. They did it for medical reasons, but then I thought how super-cool it would be to get a set of Russian dolls of your embryo as it develops. Would that even work?

“Based on the images we had, it was unclear whether the mass would block Conan’s airway after birth,”explained Glenn Green, one of the doctors who worked on the case. “The 3D printed model of the fetus allowed us to actually see in person what it looked like and have something in our hands to help us decide the best way to care for the baby.”

On Losing Weight

A few years back, I spent ten months living and studying in Oklahoma. It was wonderful, and I had a great time, but one of the things that surprised me the most was the scale of the obesity epidemic there. About a third of the adults in the State are obese. That’s why a piece by Mosaic caught my eye yesterday, chronicling the efforts of Oklahoma City’s mayor to fight back. It’s remarkable, because it’s being done with the fast food and soda industries on board, and relies largely on persuasion rather than taxes and bans.

You should read it in full, but here’s an excerpt:

In January 2012 the city hit the mayor’s million-pound target — 47,000 people had signed up, losing on average more than 20 pounds apiece. An admirable achievement, with the campaign proving a clever way to raise awareness. But for all the publicity, Cornett’s ambitions had grown way beyond that original simple stunt: now he wanted to remake his huge metropolis by remoulding it around people in place of cars. Or as he explained it, “putting the community back in the community”. Yet although these days hailed as an urban visionary, he readily admits there was no ‘grand plan’ at the outset.

On Tokyo’s Disaster Manuals

The lead story in my weekly Outside the Bubble compilation (which aims to burst geographical filter bubbles) yesterday was how a lovely illustrated manual for disaster preparedness in Tokyo has become a collector’s item — selling like crazy on internet auction sites. I got to see one of the manuals when I was in Tokyo recently, and they’re absolutely stunning.

Ford vs. 3D Printing,"Ford vs. 3D Printing

Certainly as an Autodesk employee, it is nearly impossible to ignore and not take an extreme curiosity, or better yet, an active role, in the next industrial revolution happening currently with the growth of 3D printing. The existence of 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, technology has been making history in key industries over the last 30 years. However, most groundbreaking research and discoveries about its jaw-dropping capabilities and potential have been taking place behind closed doors.

So, why pay attention now? As of recent years, 3D printing has fast and quickly been moving into the spotlight, evolving and improving its ability to accurately print a wide range of objects, from large-scale automobiles to nano-scale medical devices. An increasing amount of companies have started to scale the potential of additive manufacturing and transition their business models to facilitate its transparency, Autodesk included, of course.

From the closed research labs of engineers and scientists, into the offices, studios and classrooms of enthusiastic developers, designers and students (collectively calling themselves “makers”), 3D printing is now visibly affecting societal, industrial and environmental change.

THE SHIFT

Handicraft -> Mass Production -> Mass Customization

Before the first Industrial Revolution began in Britain during the late 1700s, the manufacturing of products took place in the home. Hand tools, basic machines, and hard-working craftsmanship were used to create everything, from transportation devices and furniture, to games and food. The sun dictated working hours and the number of hands determined productivity.

Hargreaves with his spinning jenny, Fulton with his steamboat, Watt with his powered machinery, and numerous other inventors that cradled Industrialization to maturity, these forward thinkers created the age in which we have lived for over 250 years. Special-purpose machinery and continually growing factories have been the key components of industrialization, with mass production acting as the guiding principle and flagship goal.

And no one understood or developed the potential of mass production quite like Mr. Henry Ford. Everyone is familiar with the famous Ford quotation, when describing his mass produced Model T, “[y]ou can have any color you want, as long as it’s black!” (Barnatt, 453) However, what is not well known is, why black? The black was not an educated design choice, but rather a strategic business decision, as black was the only color that could dry fast enough to keep up with Ford’s assembly line system! (Forbes, Ford)

By 1915, Ford had reduced the time it took to build an automobile by 90% and, consequently, succeeded to manufacture the first automobile that many middle class Americans could afford. By 1916, 55% of the automobiles on the road in the United States were Model Ts.

Following the success of Ford’s Model T, it makes sense that the deemed ideal industrial manufacturing equation was calculated based on his experiences: The more things you make, the lower the cost of each of those things. (Forbes, Ford)

However, what if product personalization and manufacturing in the home were possible, and still cost effective with the technological progress achieved over the past 250 years? What happens when you combine the principles of the pre-industrial era with those of mass production?

You arrive to an age of Mass Customization.

What would Ford say now if he learned he really could have any color car he wanted, with any customizations he requested or any finish he described for the same price as his Model T? The age of 3D printing creates a massive shift from mass production to mass customization and all the principles that come with it. The consumer is instantly given complete control of the designs and models he purchases. (Barnatt, 453) Although Ford cannot answer the question above, his company, still going strong, can.

General Ford Motors has indeed incorporated the 3D printing manufacturing model, having now produced their 500,000th 3D printed part. (Forbes, New Economics) The numerous functions of 3D printing together with its positive effects on the manufacturing industry have caused a myriad of companies similar to General Ford Motors to embrace 3D printing into their own manufacturing equations.

And we couldn’t be happier about it. At Autodesk Spark, we are working together on one creative platform to bring the age of customization into the reach of everyone. Here, hardware engineers, software developers, designers and materials scientists have a collaborative space to accelerate and improve the future of 3D printing, and all the customization and personal design opportunities that come with it.

Confessions of a Jealous Lover,"Confessions of a Jealous Lover

Quinn Simpson | Originally published February 6, 2014

Why my relationship with 3D printing is complex.

Look at you … All smug, like you’re hot shit … Proudly glowing purple with your cheesey LEDs. Compensating? Shut up. That was rhetorical.

You sit next to Krystal as if you were just another designer in the UX pit. See that brilliance shining on our faces over here? Yeah, that’s right. Pure innovation, baby. Don’t think about it too much. You’ll short a circuit.

I hear you turn on a few times a week. You do your little dance and make your little artificial electronic noises. You’re not fooling me.

“You’re a fraud.” I whisper to you.

My face turns flush … Sweat appears on my forehead as you spread your wormy filament in your obnoxious layers. That noise again, it’s deafening. After your little victory dance, you reveal your “creation” — a bunny rabbit. Get it away from me, I swear I’ll tear its ears off.

It wasn’t always like this. Things were great before you showed up. Just the six of us down here in the pit, happily working away without a care in the world … Why couldn’t you just let us be? Why?? <cue sobbing>

The Confession

I’ve got to get this off my chest once and for all. The burden is just too great. I express my hate for you, but in reality, it’s pure jealousy. There. I’ve said it. I’m jealous of you, MakerBot.

While I’m here trapped in the digital world, creating digital experiences behind my glowing box and preaching “more show, less tell,” you’re there popping out friendship bracelets and laser kitties. All you do is “show;” you can’t “tell”. Hell, you’ve got Kevin going to after-hours woodworking classes and us begging Thane for industrial design stories, just to experience a little you. I’m envious of your life in the tangible, pixel-less world. I love what you’re doing for the rapid prototyping movement too, and your potential to decentralize the manufacturing process for so many products to reduce costs and increase personalization. Sure, those bunny rabbits you print are fun but joking aside, I know you’re capable of bio-printing human body parts and making tiny batteries. And don’t even get me started with 4D printed self-assembly. Oh Mr. Bot, so hot right now.

If I May…

I love you enough, dear friend, to give you a few words of advice, and it’s only because I care so much. Your work is so…permanent. You print such…physical things. Sure, I know that’s the appeal and as you get faster, you can scrap one thing and make something entirely new on the fly, or even print electronics yourself. Yes, “permanent” is a relative term here. Many of the objects you create are for human use though. We’re so fickle, so unpredictable, so complex. The experiences we designers create are digital, they’re dynamic. They’re made to adjust to solve constantly changing problems that users have, ultimately enhancing user behavior. There are some clear benefits to working in the digital fields. We’ve been using this digital medium to augment ourselves for decades now, primarily via computers that are becoming more and more an extension of our physical selves than ever before. We’ve recently begun to digitally augment our stuff too, with a little help from the Internet of Things.

3D Printing claims to be a disruptor for many industries in the near future. The auto industry is one. Auto manufacturing will be decentralized as 3D printers manufacture parts in locations that are cheaper and closer to other resources. Everything from engines to instrument panels to tail light housing can now be printed. The thing though, is that no amount of 3D printing, the way we know it today, can account for the type of innovation that is already occurring in this industry and others. There are many applications for which digital innovation wins out. Rather than focus on 3D printed manufacturing of automotive instrument panels, Volvo chooses to digitally represent speed and other measurements with a digital TFT instrument panel.

Sure, physical displays work just fine, but Volvo’s display uses progressive disclosure to dynamically deemphasize speeds that are not relevant to the driver at a particular moment. Do I really care about the other half of my speedometer when I’m cruising down the neighborhood at 25? This isn’t new, as many other OEMs are doing similar things.

Audi takes it a step further with their conceptual “Swarm” lighting technology that completely replaces the rear-end of a car with a digital display that dynamically shape-shifts to changing needs of other drivers and road conditions.

Audi could use 3D printing to manufacture physical tail lights, bumpers, sheet metal, etc., but they’ve chosen to conceptualize a much more dynamic solution that could, say, allow the tail lights to grow three times their normal size under heavy braking, or change the color of the car based on driver preference or weather conditions. Yes, 3D printing will be so much faster in the future, allowing drivers to quickly print out customized parts that suit the weather for the day, for example. But digital technologies are already doing this without the limitations of the physical world. Imagine digitally representing the Audi logo and the license plate. Automotive branding takes on a whole new life. What if music and technology companies had spent all their time focusing on how to print cassette tapes rather than focus on an entirely new digital format? In these instances, innovation is less about the ways we can recreate what already exists, and more about creating what doesn’t.

At Citizen, we’ve been experimenting with projection mapping for a little while now. I actually like to compare projection mapping to you, Mr. MakerBot, if you can imagine both yourselves as producers and creators. There are some insanely awesome things happening in 3D projection right now.

The mundane physical world has become virtually enhanced, though I’d argue we’re only beginning to realize its practical uses. The same could be said for augmented reality. Admittedly though, humans are still physical beings (that line is being blurred more everyday) and we still need physical objects to complement our physical existence. (Ford has learned this the hard way.) There are some industries for which printing purely physical objects will always win out, but I do wonder how digital technologies will enhance them.

No, I’m not mad at you, HAL. I mean…Don’t get me wrong. Your printed turtles are dumb, but I’m jealous of them, and of you, nonetheless. I’m jealous of your work in the physical world and your ability to truly deliver in the flesh. At the same time though, I’ve got some new respect for us old-school digitalists. I believe that true innovation lies somewhere in the “Phygital” world, the physical + digital one. Citizen has naturally freed itself from the mobile screen, branching out into the connected car, wearables (after all, the car is just another wearable), smart athletics, health, and the world of data. We’re becoming phygitalists, creating for users, for technology, and for industry. If I had to guess, I’d say your future lies somewhere here too.

With step-by-step instructions, you can learn how to incorporate 3D modeling into Minecraft. And why would you want to do that? Because it can help you make complex buildings in Minecraft much faster than if you do them brick by brick.

Let’s say you wanted to build a castle. In fact, you start the book learning how to build a castle. If you build it in MinecraftCreative Mode, you will need to place each individual block, which can take many hours. Whereas Kelly’s book teaches you how to use 3D modeling software such as Tinkercad to make the very same castle in a quarter of the time.

You’ll learn how to do 3D modeling and import those models into Minecraft, make mazes to bring into the game, and even take creations from your real world and incorporate them into the Minecraft world. Moreover, you’ll learn valuable 3D modeling skills that can be applied beyond Minecraft, so what begins as play ends up being practice towards building 3D objects on the computer.

My son loves the book because it’s very easy to follow the detailed instructions. He was able to hop on the computer, download a few additional programs, and get started immediately. He also loves this idea because if his world is ever “griefed,” he can store copies of his 3D generated buildings elsewhere on the computer and import them again into Minecraft: instant rebuild.

Kelly’s book moves kids from being Minecraft players into Minecraft engineers, and he teaches them how to stretch their imagination to look at the Minecraft landscape as a blank canvas on which to creatively problem-solve and build.

This book is a great tool for anyone looking to try their hand in 3D modeling; after all, having a specific project to do is the perfect way to learn. And Minecraft is an excellent springboard to get your started.

Get a copy now and you’ll be set for winter break: it’s the perfect project-based book that will keep kids learning even when they’re off from school.

Note: I was sent a review copy of the book, but all opinions on the book are my own.

Metal 3D Printing Reimagined: DesktopMetal,"By Bilal Zuberi

Team = Check

Technology = Check

Market = Check

That’s why Lux Capital chose to invest in DesktopMetal’s Series A alongside NEA, KPCB, and other smart investors.

DesktopMetal plans to revolutionize metal 3D printing. Current state of the art is…cumbersome. State of the art metal 3D printers are expensive, bulky, need complex setup including heavy use of inert gases, and are relatively slow. We know because we have studied this space well, and have invested in the broad 3D printing space multiple times now (e.g. Shapeways and Sols). Shapeways in fact uses the best of the best technology for their metal printed products and even they would argue much better is needed. The space needs to be ‘disrupted’ with a complete re-imagination of how metal 3D printing might work for broad usage. DesktopMetal team aims to bring a revolutionary new printer technology to the market for both prototyping and production use. I am sure Ric will share a lot more in months/years to come.

He is the crazy guy who gave me my first ride in a Tesla Roadster (likely among the first owners of a Tesla in the Boston area). I have an incredible amount of respect for him as a most curious, creative, and resourceful entrepreneur. Ric, Yet-Ming Chiang, Chris Shuh and other members of the team are also well known to the entire Lux team. So when Ric called to tell us what he was doing, it didn’t take us long to agree to become his partners.

At Lux we love entrepreneurs like Ric who take on challenging technical problems — and where the reward maybe off the charts in case of success. They are dreamers and crazy enough to believe they can succeed. We are proud to join Ric and the team in this journey to help, support, and cheer.

Thank You,"Well that was exhilarating!

Asfand, Rich and I would like to thank you all for backing us. We reached our goal in under 3 hours! Hat-tip to James who backed us in the first 10 seconds. We are now over 200% of goal. What an amazing first 2 days!

We have received over a thousand messages in just one day. We read and reply to every message, so feel free to reach out anytime. The easiest way to reach us is on our website. Just click on the chat icon (in the bottom right).

We are very humbled that many of you also share in our vision of a 3D future. When we started on this road over a year ago we knew something didn’t feel right with 3D scanning. We didn’t want to design and build something that was just another piece of technology, we wanted to take a radical path and shift the center of the 3D scanning universe to something that enables creativity, onto our smartphones. We are so excited that many of you in the Kickstarter community agree with us.

Over the next couple of weeks, members of our team will share in many of the aspects of the eora 3D scanner from it’s development, beautiful design, app and the turntable. We can’t wait to start sharing this journey with you.

We made it onto the front page of Product Hunt. We’d love for you to head over and show us some ❤

Apple iPad Air 2 64GB — $599

It’s always fun to spend fake money. But if you’re going to spend money you don’t have, you might as well spend it well. Right?

Last week’s inventory for the fictional maker space at the fictional Dominican High School included items from the worlds of robotics, 3D printing, movie making, music making, and many more. The inspiration for many of those items came from searching through actual maker spaces in my PLN and from the up-and-coming maker space at the school where I work. And because our assigned budget was a moderate $3000, we really wanted to make it stretch. This required a thorough and comprehensive investigation of each item and any viable alternatives. And as any modern American consumer knows, it’s all about balancing the reviews with the price.

Dremel Idea Builder — $999

This week, my group created a Prezi of our investigation which we will present to our class next week. Before I take you through the process of investigating each item and choosing which items to present, let me first say a few words on Prezi. I’ve tried. And I’ve tried. But despite my efforts, I cannot get on board with Prezi. I do not like it as a program for creating visually pleasing yet functional presentations. I find that the only benefit of Prezi over MS PowerPoint is that Prezi offers the ability to organize one’s information into a meaningful geographic landscape. The ability to create frames that stem from other frames allows one to organize information in a way that may communicate something visual to the audience. Consider if one wanted to present a family lineage in alinear fashion without the image of a tree. Prezi allows for this. However, my gripe with it is: how often is that actually necessary? I find that section headers and title cards in MS PowerPoint are sufficient for organizing a landscape of informaton. Proponents of Prezi might argue that it is mroe visually pleasing, and perhaps that is true for some. Yet, is it that visually pleasing? I would liken Prezi to Smartboards — flashy and cool at first, but eventually, the poor functionality of each renders the flashy factor obsolete.

littleBits Base Kit — $99

Now, onto the heart of the matter — the investigation. As a group, we chose 4 items from last week’s inventory to evaluate and present to the class. We each chose 1 item and we each contributed to the Dremel 3D printer. I chose to contribute the pros to the Dremel, and I began my investigation at the Dremel product page for the particular model we listed on our inventory. I was impressed by the videos on the product page’s website that offered general instructions, ideas for application, and troubleshooting techniques. Next, it was on to Amazon.com to read reviews of the Dremel as well as some competing 3D printers. I found two 3D printers that were comparable to the Dremel — Solidoodle ($600) and Flashforge ($1300). Flashforge had some compelling negative reviews on Amazon.com, and considering the price difference — the Dremel Idea Builder prices at $1000 — that eliminated the Flashforge from my considerations. Also, the Solidoodle had several reviews criticizing its customer service. And considering 3D printers are such highly technical devices, I thought good customer service is a major plus. In addition, I found that the “proprietary” (non-generic; sold by the company) filament, which is the material with which 3D printers print, was cheaper than its competitors. Overall, it seems like a good balance of quality and low price.

Lego Movie Maker app — $0.00

Next, I undertook the Lego Movie Making items. I first got this idea from an Apple conference for librarians and media specialists I attended last year; and it sounded like an excellent project for a library maker space, because no single classroom can invest in all of these materials. Instead, a library can, and it can be made accessible by classes and clubs. The item list for this project included three lego sets (e.g. figurines, blocks, platforms), an iPad for filming, and the Lego Movie Maker app. The item that shines the most here — the app itself — is free! I’ve played with this app and it is incredibly user-friendly, intelligible, and visually pleasing. It is a nearly perfect app, and it makes stop-motion movie making so easy. I found that the sets are perfect for customization and creative building, yet, specialty Lego pieces, such as curved pieces and all those fun pieces that could give a Lego movie personality, are difficult to buy in wholesale. Perhaps, our makerspace could organize a donation drive of students’ and staff’s old Legos.

And, I’m happy to announce that I have a meeting next week with our advancement office to go over some of the maker space ideas from this project. Maybe I’ll be seeing this inventory list come to life very soon.",https://medium.com/@adamapo/shopping-list-for-a-maker-space-ea06059b8440,['Adam Apo'],2015-10-21 20:32:34.916000+00:00,"['3D Printing', 'Technology']"
INVESTMENT CASTING,"INVESTMENT CASTING

Investment Casting, also known as Lost-Wax Casting, is a machining process that dates all the way back to it’s use in Ancient Egypt. In todays modern world, Investment Casting produces the bonnet ornaments for Rolls-Royce cars, as well as gas turbines, marine shackles, jewelry, medical tools, and a wide variety of machining parts. This process is meant for creating parts with complex shapes, rather then rigid forms that may be machined out of solid metal. Investment Casting begins with a wax mold, formed out of an aluminum die. Once the desired thickness of wax is obtained, the mold is then dipped into a ceramic slurry and left to dry. Before filling the ceramic mold with molten metal, the wax must be melted in an oven and poured out. The extra space left by the absent wax is extremely important, as metal shrinks when drying, the mold must be slightly larger to create the desired size. The end result is a solid metal part formed by the ceramic cavity. If you can forget the wax mold, only considering the ceramic mold used as a cavity for the molten wax. Think about it as a cup of coffee in a mug, left to sit in freezing weather. If you let the coffee freeze for long enough, you could break off the mug and be left with a solid block of ice, formed to the shape of the inside of the mug.

This machining process is extremely valuable in the manufacturing industry as it not only allows for the formation of complex parts, but also provides an efficient approach to material use. A desired part can be hollowed out, saving on material use and weight. Also, the already used ceramic molds can be recycled into the existing slurry, for another go after use. It’s cost effective production is also quite promising as tooling prices are relatively cheap in comparison to other machining processes. Depending on the size of the operation, several hundred small parts can be formed in one run.

As it goes with almost all metal casting processes, the power required to heat the wax, and more importantly, the molten metal, can consume a lot of energy. The environment may also be negatively effected by the use of alcohol based binders, which some manufacturing industries still use.",https://medium.com/@hspates/investment-casting-ac8c03b3a8c7,['Harry Pates'],2015-10-28 19:27:18.304000+00:00,"['Manufacturing', '3D Printing']"
Disruptive Power Lies at the Intersections,"When I first started using the term “Combinatorial”, people thought I was making words up. Although I’d like to take credit for the word, I first came across it when reading The Second Machine Age, a fascinating book by Andrew McAfee and Eric Brynjolfsson. I remember thinking that it was a perfect word to capture the amplification of both innovation and its disruptive power. By now, readers of this Blog have seen the foundational Visual that describes the digital foundation, innovation accelerators, and disruptive scenarios. What the visual does not convey without the associated narrative is the power of combinatorial.

If we build on top of the visual, we begin to see the complexity at the intersections, the amplification of disruptive power, and the broad implications for the future.

The best way to describe this phenomenon is through examples, so let’s look at six combinatorial scenarios as an overlay. The visual is a bit overwhelming, so a better way to follow the various paths is via this PDF. Here is a description of each scenario. The numbers in the visual above map to the scenarios below, and the colors show the combinations:

Combinatorial Scenario 1

Parking has long been an issue for cities, both in terms of traffic congestion and pollution. In addition, parking revenues are impacted by dumb meters that cannot account for the money contained inside; leading to theft and loss of revenue. As smart cities emerge, smart meters drive additional parking revenue and smart parking solutions help citizens find parking more efficiently — reducing both congestion and emissions.

But what starts as a net gain could evolve to a loss, as smart cities intersect with sharing economy mechanisms. Passengers increasingly find rides through Transportation Network Companies (TNC) that crowd source from a pool of drivers. These TNCs have the potential to disrupt current city transportation networks. Additionally, these sharing mechanisms combine with autonomous vehicles to eliminate the need for parking altogether. A driverless car can move from passenger to passenger in a highly optimized manner, eliminating the need for parking and freeing up city property for other uses. But revenues that went up via smart parking solutions now disappear. Further, this same convergence of shared economy and autonomous vehicles re-imagines the taxi and ride sharing industries and has the potential to disrupt mass transit revenue streams. Why would Uber need drivers when their fleet is fully driverless? So combinatorial innovation gives: enabling ride sharing and creating a platform for us all to become drivers — and it takes away: additional combinations ultimately eliminate the need for any of us to drive.

Combinatorial Scenario 2

Fatalities via car accidents are the biggest source of organ donations today. If autonomous vehicles eliminate 90% of those accidents as Google predicts, organ donations will plummet. This will likely drive an intersection with 3D Printing, as the potential for this outcome drives more investment in enabling 3D printed organs in order to offset the loss. The importance of seeing as many outcomes as possible is highlighted by this scenario, as these intersections are not readily apparent.

Combinatorial Scenario 3

If renewable energy is to reduce or eliminate our reliance on fossil fuels, it requires a mechanism to store surplus energy, a bi-directional grid, and an ability to match supply and demand. The same sharing economy mechanisms that optimize the matching of driver and rider, or guest and room provider could enable renewable energy at scale by linking surplus energy with demand. If you also combine the nanotechnology innovation accelerator, you begin to see the same reduction in solar panel size (and therefore broader adoption) that we’ve seen in the electronics area. This highlights a key accelerant: the convergence across the sciences and with technology puts everything on the same exponential curve that technology has enjoyed for years. This information enablement of just about anything is a fundamental driver of exponential progression.

Combinatorial Scenario 4

Now let’s take the last scenario a step further. If you combine renewable energy, sharing economy mechanisms, nanotechnology and the Internet of Things, you create an Energy Internet that does for energy what the Internet did for communications. The energy platform of the future could indeed be the product of combinatorial innovation, with the Internet of Things at its foundation.

Combinatorial Scenario 5

Resource consumption could be a difficult societal challenge as the world sees 3 billion more consumers by 2025, and 5 billion in the middle class by 2030. This speaks to a potential scarcity scenario. But, as the convergence of sciences and technology drives us towards a world of abundance versus scarcity, the need for traditional resources could be eliminated altogether. So which is it? This combinatorial scenario is interesting, as 3D printing enables a maker economy that converges with the sharing and circular economy to alter the resource consumption mix. Autonomous vehicles and renewable energies contribute to this shift, as lighter cars designed for experience change the parts mix, while solar panels require more steel.

Combinatorial Scenario 6

Much like energy, Logistics & Transport is likely transformed in the future. A Logistics Internet could very well emerge that combines the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, and sharing economy mechanisms. In this scenario, the sharing economy kicks into overdrive to leverage the world’s warehouse infrastructure as a shared resource. Supply and demand matching would resemble a room provider being matched with a guest via Airbnb. This sharing would drive a previously unattainable level of productivity. Autonomous vehicles would alter the current transportation paradigm, while the Internet of Things serves as the enabling foundation.

These combinatorial examples make it clear that isolated analysis of any given disruptive scenario is not sufficient. The true disruptive power lies at the intersections. Understanding these combinations helps us exploit disruptive opportunity; versus succumbing to disruptive stress. This same ability to combine and disrupt provides a platform for next generation efficiency and effectiveness. However, isolated efforts won’t get us there; the power lies at the intersections

Hold a Safe Open House:,"Holding an open house is a selling tool that real estate agents use to reach more potential buyers. Some buyers have not chosen a real estate agent and frequently start their house search by visiting open houses and looking at homes on real estate websites on the internet. A good open house should be supported by streets signs, internet ads, newspaper and marketing to local real estate organizations.

If you have the same model home, they may merely want ideas on how they can decorate their house.

Open houses are the ideal chance for someone to check out your home and what valuables you have. If the real estate agent is not prudent in watching every person that shows up to look at your assets, it will give potential thieves the opportunity to steal proceeds.

"In This Day and Age, Should I Use A Real Estate Agent To Sell My Home Or Sell It Myself?","With powerful sites such as Zillow and Trulia available in the palm of your hand, real estate information readily available on demand, and smartphone photography coupled with social media marketing, you may question the benefits of using a real estate agent to sell your home.

For starters, let’s take a look at some numbers:

- Having a real estate agent has been proven to net 25% more for your home

- 89% of For Sale By Owner’s fail, eventually listing with an Agent

Real estate agents sell homes every single day, which means they foresee issues and know the best sales and marketing strategies. Real estate agents can also help keep a seller’s emotions in check, which is important.

But what about the cost? 6% can be a steep price to pay!

It’s true. With a median sale price in New York of $549,000, the typical seller would be looking at paying almost $33,000 in commissions. Online brokerage NestQuest Direct thinks this is too much. They think you should be able to sell your home using a knowledgeable real estate agent who can get the most for your home, without having to pay so much. So they launched an innovative flat rate model that uses local agents who are paid a salary instead of commission. You simply choose one of their four flat rate packages and they go to work, saving sellers an average of $15,000!

Chances are your home is your largest asset and therefore you have built up substantial equity. So selling your home can be your most important financial decision. When you are ready to sell, you have to ensure you keep as much of that equity as possible.

With that in mind, many people think that selling their home themselves will save them money. However, real estate agents are proven to get up to 25% more for your home. For example, the founder of popular real estate website, ForSaleByOwner.com tried to sell his New York Apartment himself. But after 6 months with no luck, he enlisted a real estate agent who raised the price of the home by $150,000 and sold it within a few months.

With NestQuest’s flat rate model, sellers get the best of both worlds: savings and a real estate agent.

But if you are still not convinced, NestQuest Direct offers a basic package for owners to personally list their home. If you can find the time, put forth the effort, and utilize available resources efficiently to market and sell your home for top dollar, Go For It.

But considering that 89% of FSBOs end up listing with a real estate agent, the majority of people who have the time and made the effort, simply may not have the knowledge. Poor pricing and marketing strategies are the main reasons for FSBO failure. Local agents have the knowledge and their brokers have spent years advertising, marketing and selling, so they know what works and what does not.

Why are NestQuest Direct Agents different from all other Real Estate Agents?

In addition to their 0% commission flat rate packages which save sellers thousands of dollars, they employ technology and creative teams who specialize in marketing your home. This allows your sales agent to spend 100% of his or her time selling. And NestQuest’s agents are not paid a commission either. Rather, they are paid a salary and bonus based on your satisfaction. So they will never rush a negotiation to get a deal done. They are paid regardless, ensuring they get top dollar for your home.

NestQuest Direct has options for any seller out there, whether that be a FSBO, or a complete hands off seller who wants their home sold fast and for the most money. Contact NestQuest Direct today with any questions. They will send a local Agent to your home and tell you what your house is worth, and how much they can save you.",https://medium.com/@nickralph/in-this-day-and-age-should-i-use-a-real-estate-agent-to-sell-my-home-or-sell-it-myself-6708001a7413,['Nick Ralph'],2015-12-17 19:06:21.238000+00:00,"['Real Estate', 'Real Estate Investments']"
Why should you hire Property Management for your Resident or Commercial Assets?,"Why should you hire Property Management for your Resident or Commercial Assets?

Property management is a niche sector of the property industry and it’s a specialized job which involves a wide range of tasks from rent management to legal issues and handling tenants directly to building maintenance. Managing all these elements on your own as an individual property owner is quite a huge feat which is why it is much more sensible to hire a professional property management company for your residential or commercial properties. There are a wide range of property management companies in Manchester and across other UK cities, ready to provide services tailored to your individual requirements.

Properties such as blocks of flats are often rife with tenant issues which may even lead to the need for litigation if they are not managed property. Timely collection of rent, timely payment of bills, timely compliance of legal obligations and regular maintenance of the building is must if the owner wishes to avoid unnecessary legal and local issues and live peacefully. These companies offer dedicated services which require lots of experience and specialist training and many of the property management companies Manchester businesses have to choose between have experience in properties of all different sizes and types, from leasehold properties to large apartment blocks and commercial properties.

As a property owner it is almost impossible to manage all the legal and daily requirements of running a busy apartment block or commercial premises, and stay on top of your personal and career commitments. You may not have the in-depth industry knowledge and experience whereas a professional property manager is trained to handle every situation from the litigation that arises from tenant disputes to handling emergency maintenance problems. They also have the steady professional attitude to handle tenant issues which get heated and may be difficult for an inexperienced property owner to handle in an appropriate way.

The Beginner’s Guide to Buying a House,"Photo via Pexels

Something most people want to accomplish in their lifetime is buying a home. However, the process may seem intimidating to many. While it can indeed be complicated and require many steps, you can ease most of your fears by learning more about the process. With that in mind, below is an overview of some of the basics.

1. Budgeting

The first step to finding a house should always be determining your budget. This budget should have a maximum cap that cannot be exceeded. Since buying a home is such a big financial investment, going over budget can have serious consequences for your financial livelihood. You could even end up losing the house and be forced to rent again, putting you back at square one.

However, how do you budget? You need to consider your annual income. Do you have a steady income with a career with good job security? If that is the case, you should look at houses with a price of about two to three times your yearly income. That way, you’ll eventually be able to pay off the mortgage. Also, in regards to the monthly mortgage payments, try to obtain a mortgage in which the monthly payment does not exceed 28 percent of your monthly income. A bit less than that may be preferable.

You will also of course, need to make a down payment. This can range between 5 and 20 percent of the price of the house. Without enough money to make the down payment, you will be denied the mortgage. Other costs you should budget for include costs related to maintenance and home improvement. This is especially the case if you aren’t buying new.

2. Finding Your Home

Once you have a budget in mind, as well as other criteria regarding your preferences for rooms, space, etc., you should begin actively looking for a home in the right location. Before you speak to a real estate agent, do plenty of your own research. Check out listings online as well as in print. In many restaurants, you can find little free booklets printed on cheap paper that list homes in that area for sale including the price.

You should also take advantage of real estate investor software. While you may think this software is only for people that use real estate as a form investment instead of as a home, this is not the case. The average home shopper can reap plenty of benefits from the tools included in such a software program. For example, BirdDogBot can allow you to investigate real estate for sale in a specific area, track those properties over time and perform complex calculations to analyze the value of the real estate in question.

3. Choosing the Right Mortgage

Once you have a better grip on your budget and the kind of home you want, you should get serious about obtaining a mortgage. Begin shopping around for mortgage lenders. Choose one that has good ratings for both customer service as well as quick closings. Make sure you choose a lender who is open to answering all the questions you may have about the process and getting approved.

You will also need to choose the kind of mortgage you will buy. There are several different varieties. The most common are fixed rate mortgages and adjustable rate mortgages also referred to as ARMs for short. Fixed rate mortgages maintain the same interest rates throughout the life of the loan. The interest rates for adjustable rate mortgages, however, can and will fluctuate in reaction to market forces.

Choosing the correct kind of mortgage is important. Certainly factor into your decision the likelihood of the performance of the economy changing interest rates in the future. It could result in you loosing or saving money on interest as a result. In general, however, fixed rate mortgages may be preferable for individuals that plan to live in the same house for the rest of their lives. Due to the possible fluctuations of an ARM’s interest rate, you may eventually end up paying much more for your mortgage than you planned.

Mortgages can also differ by the term of the loan. 15-year and 30-year mortgages are the most common. However, 30-year mortgages may be preferable for the average homeowner. 15-year mortgages may be a better choice for the wealthy that do have the ability to pay off a home loan much quicker.

4. Pre-Approval

Last, you’ll need to try to get pre-approval for your mortgage. During this process, the lending institution will do a close examination of your financial situation including your credit history, W2 forms from your employer, bank statements and more. After you are pre-approved, you will have a stronger bargaining position to negotiate with the lender on a fair price based on the home’s value as opposed to your financial situation.",https://medium.com/@finneganpierson/the-beginner-s-guide-to-buying-a-house-bc57c041c705,['Finn Pierson'],2015-12-22 18:24:13.504000+00:00,"['Mortgage', 'Real Estate', 'Real Estate Investments']"

Finding a good tenant is like dating — you have to sift through a bunch of candidates to find one compatible with you.

Nowadays online dating has become very common, so why not try your luck and list your property online too?

Buy yourself another sim card

When your upload your property online, we highly advise you to buy a temporary SIM card and include that number in the listing. If you include your usual phone number, you may receive spam calls from a bunch of real estate agents.

Check the terms and conditions

The terms and conditions vary between online posting channels. On Spacious, we provide free listings for property owners and the listing will be available online for four weeks.

10 Ways to Stop Foreclosure





House in chains (Foreclosure)

1. Forbearance





""Forbearance"" is an agreement with your bank/lender to stop the foreclosure in exchange for paying the overdue amount (called ""arrearages""). The arrearages are paid in either one lump sum, or a schedule of payments over a period of time (typically 6-12 months). In some cases, your lender may even allow you to pay reduced monthly payments until you get back on your feet. More than likely, they will INCREASE your monthly payments to cover your owed arrears. Of course, your lender will only agree to forbearance if you can afford to resume your monthly payments. For example, if you got behind on your monthly payments because you lost your job, but were recently rehired, your lender night consider forbearance. Unfortunately, most homeowners facing foreclosure cannot come up with the money to make up back payments, nor can they afford higher monthly payments.

Bottom Line: To take advantage of this solution, you must be able to:





1. Pay the arrearages in a lump sum and be able to resume your monthly payments, or......

2. Afford higher monthly payments (i.e. your original monthly mortgage payment plus a portion of the arrearages) until the arrears have been paid off.



2. Loan Modification





""Loan Modification"" means changing the terms of your mortgage. (Also called recasting the mortgage) For example, lowering the interest rate, increasing the loan amount, extending the amount of time you have to repay the loan and/or other charges that your lender agrees to.

A lender will typically consider a loan modification if you will be able to make your new mortgage payments after the change. For example, if you lost your job and got a lower-paying job, your lender may lower your monthly payments, but increase the number of years you must pay your mortgage.

Bottom Line: To take advantage of this solution, you must be able to: show your lender that you can afford the new monthly payments.





3. FHA ""Partial Claim"" Loan





If you have an FHA insured (Federal Housing Administration) loan, you may qualify for a one-time ""partial claim"" loan. To qualify, your mortgage must be delinquent 4-12 months and you must be able to resume full mortgage payments.

When a lender files a ""partial claim"" FHA/HUD (Housing and Urban Development) pays your mortgage current. However, in exchange for the ""partial claim"" loan, FHA/HUD puts a lien on your home and gives you an interest-free loan that is due when your mortgage is paid in full (for example, after a refinance or when you sell your house). In other words, you have to eventually pay FHA/HUD back for the amount of money they paid your lender, but you don’t have to pay them back until you pay off your mortgage or sell your house. Visit http://www.hud.gov for more info.



Bottom Line: To take advantage of this solution, you must:





1. Have a FHA-insured mortgage.

2. Not already have a ""partial claim"" loan from FHA/HUD.



3. Be delinquent at least 4 months and no more than 12 months.



4. Show that you can afford to make the monthly payments in the future.



5. Remember that, sooner or later, you will have to pay back the amount of the ""partial claim"" loan.



4. Refinancing your Mortgage





""Refinancing"" is when a lender ( either the current lender or a new lender) gives you a new mortgage to replace your current mortgage. Of course, the new mortgage will likely be more than your current mortgage because the points, late payments and other fees will be added to it.Unfortunately, most homeowners facing foreclosure cannot refinance because they do not have good credit, or enough equity in their house. ""Equity"" is the difference between what your house is worth and the the amount of the loans against it. For example, if your house is worth $300,000 and you owe $250,000 on a 1st mortgage and $15,000 on a 2nd mortgage, you have $35,000 in equity because $300,000 house value, less $250,000 representing the 1st mortgage, less $15,000 for the 2nd mortgage equals $35,000 in equity.

Bottom Line: To take advantage of this solution, you must:





1. Have good credit and/or enough income to qualify for a new loan and/or....

2. Have a substantial amount of equity in your home' sufficient to meet the lenders guidelines.



5. Another Loan (i.e. 2nd mortgage, 3rd mortgage, etc.)





This is a new mortgage in addition to the mortgage(s) you already have on your house. The money from this loan is used to bring your mortgage current and stop the foreclosure.Unfortunately, the new loan will have a high interest rate (similar to most credit cards) and cost 5-10 points. A ""point"" is 1% of the borrowed amount. For example, if you borrow $10,000, 10 points equals $1,000.



Also, since it’s another loan, keep in mind that you’ll have higher monthly payments. Beware of this trap, because if you cannot afford your current monthly payment(s), how will you be able to afford higher ones?



Bottom Line: To take advantage of this solution, you must:





1. Have a lot of equity in your house and....

2. Be able to afford the additional payment each month.



6. Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure (DIL)





A ""deed in lieu of foreclosure"" is when you voluntarily give your house back to your lender and move out. In exchange, the lender stops the foreclosure and agrees not to sue you for more money if the house is sold for less than the amount you owed.

Since a DIL does not wipe out junior liens (i.e. 2nd mortgage and other liens), banks will usually not accept a DIL because they do not want to inherit the junior liens against the house. Also, you will not receive any money for your house when you use a DIL.



Bottom Line: In general, to take advantage of this solution, you must only have one mortgage. If you have a 2nd mortgage, 3rd mortgage, etc, most banks will not accept a DIL.





7. Sell Your House to a Regular Homebuyer





Unless your situation has improved, selling your house is one of the best -and in most cases, the ONLY-way to stop foreclosure.

Although you probably want to stay in your house, the truth is that selling your house and moving is a lot less painful than losing your house to foreclosure and having to move anyway. At least if you sell your home, it will be on your terms - not the lenders - and you have a better chance of getting some cash out of your house. Plus, you’ll stop the foreclosure and save your credit. If you decide to sell your house to a regular home-buyer, you can either try to sell it your self, or use a real estate agent.



If you sell your house yourself, you’ll save money on your real estate agent commissions. However it will probably take longer to sell.....time you don’t have. You will also have to spend time and money advertising and showing the house to a potential buyer. You will also have to understand how to write up a contract, and where to go to complete the transaction (title agency in most states).



If you sell your house through a real estate agent, you’ll probably sell your house a lot quicker - and probably at a higher price. But you have to pay a commission to the agent (typically 6%, which on a $300,000 home is $18,000.



Bottom Line: In order to take advantage of this solution, you must:





1. Have enough time (typically 3-6 months, or more considering current market conditions) to find a qualified buyer and close escrow before the foreclosure auction.

2. Have enough equity to pay the real estate agent’s commissions (if you use an agent).



3. Have enough time and money to perform all necessary repairs, or you can sell the property ""as is"" for a lesser price.



8. Sell Your House to an Investor





If you don’t have enough time to sell your house to a regular home-buyer, don’t have enough equity to pay real estate agent’s commissions, and/or don’t have the time or money to perform repairs, then selling to an investor is probably YOUR BEST BET.

An investor won’t pay full price for your house, but he/she can close quickly, pay all cash and buy your house in ""as is"" condition. This allows you to STOP the foreclosure, SAVE any more damage to your credit and get CASH to move on and/or pay other expenses and bills.



Bottom Line: To sell your property to an investor: you must sell your house at a discount, because the investor will have costs to fix your home and resell it. Just be sure to find a reputable company, or investor that you know you can trust! I can help you with that, just visit http://www.andreabuyspahouses.com





9. A Short-Sale





A ""short sale"" is an agreement with your lender to accept less money than they’re owed as full payment for your loan. This solution often makes sense when you owe more than what the property is worth. For example, if you owe $280,000, but your property is only worth $220,000 a short sale may be your only option.

There are no guarantees that the lender will accept the short sale. Keep in mind that your bank does NOT want your house back! It is considered a non-performing asset and they cannot have too many in their books! They want to work something out with you. This process is very time consuming and the negotiations can become very stressful. Rather than trying to negotiate a short sale yourself, call a professional who is experienced in negotiating with lenders.



Bottom Line: To take advantage of this solution, you should talk to an experienced short sale negotiator.





10. Bankruptcy





It is very important you understand how bankruptcy works and we suggest you meet with a bankruptcy attorney before considering this option. Many people use bankruptcy as a scare tactic. There are several different ""chapters"" of bankruptcy. Some are work-out others are wipe-out, but here is the general idea: when someone files bankruptcy it’s almost like someone build a ""bullet-proof"" barrier around the house. No one can touch you! However, you are not free of all responsibility and most people do not understand that. We are not bankruptcy attorneys, but you need to know the difference between a Chapter 7 and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, so you know what happens.

Like we mentioned earlier, some bankruptcies are ""work out"" and others are ""wipe out."" The two that we will focus on are Chapters 7 &13. These are the most common in your situation. Chapter 7 is the ""wipe out"" and Chapter 13 is the ""work out"". Bankruptcy is a federal court action designed to help individuals to repay or eliminate their debts depending on their circumstances. Chapter 13 bankruptcies are designed to reorganize debts in an effort to pay off all the debt. Chapter 7 bankruptcies are geared more towards liquidation of assets. Both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 immediately stop the foreclosure process and any creditors from taking further action against you.



Here is how Chapter 7 works.





When someone files a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, all assets and creditor collections are technically frozen which is called an automatic stay. The person filing bankruptcy cannot buy or sell anything, nor can they give away their property. If they try to sell their home, the court could order the receiving party to return it to the custody of the appointed Trustee. Unsecured debt such as credit cards , unsecured loans, etc. are typically eliminated, although yo should confer with your attorney on the rules regarding this. Then the trustee or the attorney who represents the court and the creditors will look at all the assets (house, car, furniture, equipment) anything of value and decide what must be liquidated to pay some of the debt that was wiped out. The statute provides that there are some minimal assets a person filing bankruptcy may keep.

If the homeowners are involved in a pending foreclosure, a Chapter 7 will stop the foreclosure process temporarily.Usually, your lender will request the court appointed Trustee to release the property from the automatic stay, so they can continue with the foreclosure process. Once the property has been released from the bankruptcy, the foreclosure process starts up again.



Chapter 13 is a little different.





When someone files a Chapter 13, they usually keep their assets and repay their debt in a debt consolidation plan. Whatever amount is agreed upon has to be paid to the Bankruptcy Court for the next 3-5 years. The homeowner usually keeps their house, car and other assets. The homeowner is required to stay current with the mortgage payments and pays the amount agreed upon. If any payments are missed, the trustee will dismiss the bankruptcy and the foreclosure process will begin again.

Bankruptcy is usually the last resort and should not be used to stop foreclosure unless you have no other option, or else you need the protection of a bankruptcy due to other circumstances. If you feel this may be your best option, please seek legal advice.



Bottom Line: To take advantage of this solution you should consult an experienced bankruptcy attorney.

Professionalism in Real Estate: 5 Best Real Estate Practices in 2015,"Cultivate an excellent reputation

Anonymous clout is a reputation that opens doors and makes first impressions on clients before the actual first meeting. Cultivating an excellent rep that is known as reliable, proactive, and getting results shows a level of professionalism that will keep agents busy. Showing up on time, dressed professionally, and being prepared for all options are more enhancements.

Develop annual strategic goals

Reviewing the numbers at year-end is a given. Following this with development of strategic goals based on lessons learned is a prudent best practice. It will serve as a blueprint that will come in handy during the busy year with open houses, closings, and marketing your business. In addition, consider pushing the envelope with goals that are just a little unreasonable as motivation to establish new markers of achievement.

Build professional partnerships

No man is an island is a cliché that real estate agents know to be true. Working with other professionals for moving a variety of properties has a plethora of benefits. There have been listings that just do not seem to move as predicted. Having a new perspective from a colleague can be the difference in closing the contract. A caveat is the unpaid marketing these relationships bring to the table.

Engage in social media

Top performers know how to stay relevant. With that said, they are certainly using the social media phenomenon to their advantage. Not only is this savvy, but it provides a marketing ROI that is unmatched. There are only four profiles that really matter including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. These outlets are open doors to just about every audience interested in real estate.

Stay available

Staying in touch with clients and partners speaks volumes about your level of commitment. For those times when the life sign is on, ensure that does not mean unavailable. Setting clear boundaries for communicating on a schedule that works for all parties shows that organization is a part of your approach.

While a personal life is essential, managing the work-life balance is a sure sign of professionalism. Since you are the business, adding creativity to these best practices will tie the efforts together. Remember, every facet of interaction needs to reflect that each client is the top priority.

Why I Switched from Startups to Real Estate,"Why I Switched from Startups to Real Estate

Going from Tech into Real Estate now means that ‘I’m a PC’. And I like it. (from Apple “I’m a Mac” advertisement)

Over the past 10 years, I’ve had the opportunity to explore 3 distinct career paths — starting with investment banking at Arbor Advisors, leading me to launch multiple technology startups at Xpert Financial, CapRally, and Venovate, and now entering into commercial real estate at HFF. My title has varied from entry-level analyst to founder/CEO.

The continuously cited reasons people flock to join or launch startups:

the feeling of doing real, challenging work,

lifestyle flexibility,

a culture of meritocracy,

outsized financial opportunities, and

ability to be entrepreneurial.

These were the exact same reasons I was questioning startups and gravitating towards the real estate space. After time in both spaces, I would argue that real estate offers a much more realistic opportunity to be successful and in control of your outcome.

At HFF, my initial focus falls into two buckets:

Investment Sales for Office Properties in the SF Bay Area— helping commercial real estate investor, operator, and developer clients realize market value for their current assets (office buildings and plots of land) and identifying new assets and opportunities for them to pursue. My experience while working with multiple startups and experience within the venture capital space will hopefully give me and my clients a competitive advantage understanding and better communicating the technology story to potential buyers. Equity Placement — connecting developer/operator clients with the right equity investor relationships on a deal-by-deal or fund basis. A majority of my career has focused on raising capital for private companies or alternative assets from a range of investors, which include high-net worth investors, family offices, venture capitalists, and registered investment advisors).

In the venture and startup space, I’ve been particularly impressed with the blogs by Tom Tunguz from Redpoint Ventures, Paul Graham from Y Combinator, and Mark Suster from Upfront Ventures. They’ve done a great job making venture and startups accessible to large audiences and shared relevant and valuable experiences with many entrepreneurs and investors who might be interested in startups. I haven’t seen anything close to this in the real estate space.

My goal with my writing is to make the commercial real estate investing space more accessible and understandable for investors, developers, operators, brokers and outsiders who might hopefully decide to become future players. My opinions will be my own and will be supported with real data when available. I will likely have a bias towards technology from my own past experiences as an entrepreneur.

How to Handle a Listing Appointment NO-SHOW,"Get the mp3/podcast of this episode free on iTunes.

SUMMARY

This is the worst. You set a listing appointment. Do all your homework…CMA, pre-listing package, get ready, and drive all the way to their house…and then you get stood up. Grrrrr…. There is nothing more frustrating, right? Well, almost nothing.

The question is, what do you do about it to salvage the appointment AND to prevent being no-showed again?

First, do not get frustrated. That will only create negative energy between you and the Seller. Stay calm. Be kind.

Second, treat it as no problem and simply reschedule.

Third, let them know you are putting it in your calendar and make sure they are putting it in their schedule as well, so this issue does not happen again. You can offer to send them a text message reminder or a calendar invite by email.

The bottom line is to be professional and kindly communicate your expectation that they treat you like a professional. It is mutually respectful for you and for them.

Watch the video for more details and how to handle the repeat offender who stands you up more than once.

FULL TRANSCRIPT

I just got an awesome question from one of my coaching members on, “What do you do when you get no show? What do you do when you get stood up on a listing appointment?” In this case, he had a listing appointment with a For Sale By Owner. Although it doesn’t matter who it is, it can be anybody. You have a listing appointment and you go to their house and they’re not there. He actually had it happen to him not once, but twice. The same seller stood him up twice! Now, they want to reschedule for a third time.

How do you deal with the no-show? How do you deal with a person who stands you up? Here’s how you do it.

#1 Don’t get mad. When you let emotions enter into your conversation either anger or frustration or irritation or annoyance or impatience, any of those emotions create negative energy and they going to create a barrier between you and them. They’re the amateur, you’re the pro. As a professional, you’ve got to maintain emotional stability and emotional calm at all times. You want to be kind and yet, it’s okay to be straightforward.

#2 You say, “Great, no problem. I understand how things like that can happen. So when would you like to reschedule so that we can get together and talk about helping you guys make this move happen? I can come out tomorrow afternoon 2:15 or we can do 4:15. Which should be better?” They say, “Let’s do 2:15.”

#3 “Perfect so I’m putting that in my calendar right now. I’ve got a us down for tomorrow at 2:15, awesome. I just want to make sure, do you have your calendar in front of you or your schedule in front of you? Cool so you got it in your calendar? Great because I just want to make sure that tomorrow when I come over at 2:15 that we’re actually going to be able to sit down and meet. Is that fair enough?” “Yes.” “Great”

#4 If they’re like, “Well, I’m in my car or I’m at work, I don’t have my calendar in front of me,” say, “No problem, why don’t I do this, as soon as we hang up I will shoot you a text message with just a reminder of our meeting time for tomorrow on your cellphone. Would that be the best way or would you prefer an email? Or I could actually do a calendar invite.”

All I’m doing is I’m being helpful to them to give them ways, I’m giving them a way to save face because I’m not accusing them or got mad at them for standing me up once but I’m giving them ways to make sure they don’t have an excuse to stand me up again. All right? That’s the main thing.

Now, what if you have a chronic repeat offender who stands you up over and over and over again, so three or four times. If they stand you up once, you deal with it. If they stand you up twice, okay, they better at least make me feel guilty and a little apologetic or I’m thinking they’re just jerking me around.

Let’s just say they say, “I’m so sorry and something came up and I just … At work, I work, my boss is this way and I can’t deal … ” and so forth, you say, “No, I understand, I certainly understand how life can get you caught up so let’s do this. When there’ll be a time when we can get together that we can avoid that kind of a situation occurring again. I’ll work with you on the time and you set up the time, you just say great. I just want to make sure that we’re going to be able to meet this time.” Now, let’s just say they stand you up again and they go, “I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.”

Now, here is before I set up another appointment after they stood me up two or three times and you kind of pre-framed him, you kind of had this conversation with him and they stand you up again, they go, “I’m so sorry, something came up.” “Great, well, listen, no problem, I understand how things can happen, we can reschedule if you want to. Let me just ask you this before we do that. Are you sure you still want to meet? I just want to make sure you really want to meet and actually talk about making this move happen or if you’re just having a hard time telling me “no”. Then they go, “Oh no, no, it’s just been busy, we still want to meet.” “Okay, cool.” What I’ve just done is I kind of taken away from them … I’ve given them an easy out and if they’re standing me up two or three times, look, we’re almost done here.

If you’re serious, you’re going to have to say you’re serious and I’ll even say this. I’ve even said this before, say, “I understand how things can happen. I just want to make sure that you’re not just having a hard time telling me “no” because if you were a girl and I’d ask her on a date and they stand me up three times, I kind of get the feeling they’re probably not interested. You know what I mean?” And they go, “Oh no, no we’re very interested, we want to meet with you.” “Okay, awesome,” but what you’ve done is, without beating them up, you’ve raised the bar of expectation and you’ve given them an out so that they’ve confirmed, “No, we definitely want to meet” because you don’t need to get stood up by somebody over and over again, who are just not interested in meeting and having a hard time telling you “no”. You wanted them to treat you with respect, you’re going to treat them with respect and kindness, you deserve the same.

Don’t be afraid to have a straightforward, kind, patient conversation with them but at least raise the bar so that they know that you’re serious and they’re not going to waste your time and you’re not going to waste theirs. That’s the way it goes and when you do that and you approach them with that top professionalism, you can always, if they’re serious, expect “yes!”

Why Property? Part XIII; Birmingham’s Prosperous Property Market,"Birmingham’s property market is once again looking prosperous as investors flock to the area to get a piece of the latest redevelopments. A property boom has been created by the coinciding of £4 billion investments to the city’s infrastructure creating new transport links and public services. The redevelopment of New Street station and Grand Central shopping centre costing £750 million has encouraged thousands more commuters to use the area’s rail links and with the completion of HS2 in the near future Birmingham will be just a 49 minute journey to London; commuters can easily live in the Midlands yet work in the capital. People are looking to invest in Birmingham as it is ever proving itself as a ‘global city’; work continues on the new Metro system which will provide rapid transport around the city centre as well as just a 20 minute connection to Birmingham International Airport. The rise in profile of the city is supported by the moves of certain head offices from London to Birmingham, HSBC and Deutsche Bank being just some of the well-known companies calling the city ‘home’. The rising rental demand can be attributed in some part to the creation of 14,000 new city-centre jobs over the last two years, and shows no sign of slowing down before 2019.

These factors have meant that there is an unprecedented rental demand within the city centre, a demand that cannot be met by developers resulting in a ‘property boom’. As well as professionals and investors looking for property in the city centre, apartment prices have rocketed due to the high demand from the 73,000 students attending Birmingham’s 5 universities. The recently redeveloped Eastside area of the city centre is also home to Birmingham City University and therefore house hunters in the form of students. Around 10,000 of these students are from China and middle-class backgrounds meaning they have substantial budgets from home enabling them to rent in some of Birmingham’s most desirable areas.

The lack of new apartment developments in Birmingham city-centre is one reason accountable for the substantial upward curve in rental yields; developers are simply not able to keep up with demand! This is where there is a unique opportunity for investment; as markets within the UK return to their prosperous phases more developments are in construction phases. With such a high demand, investing in a Birmingham property has never seemed such a good idea, where rental yields are high and there is a thirsty supply for tenants.

4 apps realtors can use to stop wasting valuable time,"4 apps realtors can use to stop wasting valuable time

When you’re in the business of selling a home, or business outpost. These investments are beholden to the local market rather than the global one, so it’s easy to think that you’re not going to be affected by the online world that has so greatly influenced other aspects of the consumer market.

Of course, this isn’t true. While Facebook and Instagram, and other social networks don’t directly affect the price of a home (at least not yet), they–and other applications like them–have changed the way that consumers understand the buying process. And of course, with a realtor being just a google search away, understanding the online playing field is only going to better your business.

We here at Trippeo know what it means to transition a traditional business to the online realm. To help ease the transition, and to make your work easier, we’ve compiled a list of tools that every realtor can use to improve their business.

Facebook, eat your heart out. RESAAS is the social and global referral network built exclusively for real estate professionals, helping to connect agents to referrals, manage their contacts with an internal CRM tool, get real-time notifications of new listings, and build their global community. Think of it as a one-stop-shop real estate intranet that houses your active queries, as well as giving you the opportunity to source new leads and homes.

Trippeo Expense Management

Real estate agents are incurring serious travel and business expenses. 74% of surveyed agents estimated they spent up to $5000 on gas alone. Add on some marketing efforts (31% spending over $1000 a year), and you’re looking at business costs of ~$6–7000 a year. Are you expensing those costs? Trippeo syncs with your debit and credit cards, tracks your mileage per kilometer, and uploads your expenses and mileage to its beautiful mobile app. Claim those expenses! Trippeo makes it easy and automated. Your tax return will thank you.

DotLoop E-Contracts and Organization

Dealing with buyers–especially new buyers–has a long list of needs and steps to take before any actually deal-making can go forth. With Dotloop, the agent makes a list of to-dos, and shares said list with their client, who can upload the necessary updates to the shared platform. These can be financial statements, the offer, the counter offer… everything. Check out a very in-depth overview of the product here. It’s like Dropbox, but specifically for real-estate financials and contracts.

Evernote

The majority of real estate agents say that their smartphone is the technology that is most important to their business. One app we love is Evernote — a note-sharing service that helps you write and share drafts, collect web articles, and file ideas. It’s a great way to remember little details that your clients appreciate so you can send them even more relevant listings.

11 Open House Safety Tips From Team Lancaster to Help Prevent Theft,"11 Open House Safety Tips From Team Lancaster to Help Prevent Theft

When selling a home, you’re going to want to hold an open house. In fact, you’ll probably hold several of them if you don’t attract a buyer right away. This means your home will be crawling with strangers that will be opening up cabinets and closets and who may even pull open drawers out of curiosity. While it might be in your nature to trust everyone, you’re still making yourself vulnerable to snooping eyes and even potential thieves. Use these 11 tips Team Lancaster has learned by holding hundreds of open house events in order to make sure that nothing gets stolen from your home:

1. Schedule a meeting with Team Lancaster or your current real estate agent about what they do to protect your valuables during an open house event. They should have enough experience to give you solid advice on precautions to take.

2. Make sure none of your valuables are displayed in the photos that you’ve put up online. You don’t want to advertise the fact that you have valuables displayed during your open house, since this is a good way to attract thieves.

3. Team Lancaster provides an extra agent or assistant that we post on your second floor (if you have a second floor). This way, you’ll have somebody to watch out for potential thieves on every floor of your home.

4. Team Lancaster uses an Open House iPad app and requires all visitors to sign in when entering the home. While actual thieves looking for valuables to steal can just sign a fake name, most people that steal things at an open house do so out of impulse; if they’ve signed their name, they’ll be discouraged from doing so since you can just hand the list over to the police if something has been taken.

5. Go through your home and remove anything of value that is displayed out in the open, such as small antique figurines on the fireplace mantel. You can find cheaper items with which to spruce up your decor; you won’t want to tempt anyone into grabbing something of value and shoving it into their pockets, after all.

6. Make sure you don’t leave out any mail, bank statements or bills on your countertops, table surfaces or even in your drawers. You should collect these sensitive documents and store them where no one else can access them, since they contain personal information that could be used to steal your identity.

7. Go through all of your drawers and cabinets — including your medicine cabinets — and remove all valuable items, such as jewelry or even prescription medication. If you have a safe, you should lock these up; if you don’t have a safe, you should consider getting one.

8. Don’t worry too much about bigger valuables, such as your 60-inch HDTV. Nobody is about to try to walk out of your door with something like that without being spotted. It’s the smaller items that can fit in someone’s pocket or purse that you should be wary of.

9. Smaller electronics, such as smartphones, laptops, tablets and more, should be removed and placed in a safe location as well.

10. While nobody is going to steal your desktop computer, make sure you are logged out, and the computer is put to sleep on a screen saver so that nobody can gain access to it.

11. Once your open house has ended, Team Lancaster will walk through the home and make sure that all windows and doors are locked. This will ensure that nobody will return after scoping out your open house to steal anything.

The open house is an important part of finding a buyer for your home. It also can leave you vulnerable to potential thieves, but you shouldn’t be paranoid about it. Instead, use these 11 tips to ensure that your valuables are secure and that you don’t leave yourself open to theft during your open house.

"The Power of Visualization: Change Your Story, Change Your Life","Get the mp3/podcast of this episode free on iTunes.

I was talking to an agent recently who at one point before the market collapse back in 2008 had created a net worth of tens of millions of dollars…and then lost it all. He didn’t just lose it. Suddenly he was tens of millions of dollars in the negative!

In this video I share the story of my conversation with that real estate agent and the shocking revelation he made to me about his fears and his struggle to overcome his fears TODAY.

The reality is that our mindset and the stories (i.e. “drama”) that we create about ourselves and our world are more powerful than we realize. And most of the time, our “story” does not help us build our business and achieve the success or lifestyle we want.

The Power of Visualization is one of the most powerful ways to make change your internal story quickly and to give yourself a stronger mindset and to improve your results. Affirmations and declarations can be very helpful, yet visualizing yourself as if you’ve already achieved something or done something adds much more power.

If you want to change your life, change your story. If you want to get better results in your life, it starts with your beliefs and expectations about what is possible for you. We all create our “story” about ourselves and then we live into that story. As an example, a “drama queen” is someone who always makes their “story” more dramatic than it really is and then they literally create that reality through their story.

Simply re-write your mental “story” to the outcome you want and visualize yourself living into that story. Real estate agents, in fact almost all people, underestimate the power their inner game has over their success. Thinking better thoughts will always create better results.

The Difference Between Failure and Success,"The Difference Between Failure and Success

Get the mp3/podcast of this episode free on iTunes.

If you’re watching it or reading this blog post and expecting some huge, sweeping proclamation about the major activities needed to succeed over failure, I’m going to disappoint you. Long-term, sustainable success isn’t built on big wins or tremendous undertakings — though those things certainly help your cause throughout your career.

Without a strong foundations, the “big wins” will be short-lived. The foundation for huge and enduring success comes from you daily practices. The reality is that the difference between success and failure comes down to the small actions you take every day and whether or not those activities move you towards your eventual goals.

At the end of the day, I want you to ask yourself the following question:

“If I were to take my day’s activities, my commitments, and the stories I’ve created about the actions I didn’t take and then repeat them every day for the rest of the year, would I reach my goals?”

On a day-to-day basis, the decisions you make — even the smallest ones — affect the results you’re going to get at the end of the year. In effect, your daily actions create the story of your year. If your activities are in sync with your goals, your story will be one of success. But if you continually make bad decisions and don’t bother to correct yourself, your story becomes one of failure.

There’s a quote on this subject from Jim Rohn that I’ve always loved:

“Small errors in judgment repeated regularly eventually leads to disaster. Small decisions of discipline repeated regularly and consistently leads to massive success.”

Making one mistake in a day isn’t going to throw you off your game or prevent you from reaching your goals — unless it becomes a pattern of underperforming.

Imagine that you’re trying to lose weight. You eat perfectly-balanced meals throughout the day and exercise hard, but at night, you find yourself so hungry that you can’t help but indulge in a chocolate bar. If you make this mistake once and then take steps to have healthier snacks on hand for the evening, this one slip-up won’t affect your overall weight loss. But if — for whatever reason — it becomes a pattern of indulging, you may actually wind up gaining more weight than you lose!

It can sound overwhelming to realize that your day-to-day actions aren’t just throwaways — they actually contribute substantially to your end results. If the thought of tallying up your daily activities scares you, don’t worry. You can start changing your patterns by simply being more aware of the stories you tell yourself.

At the end of the day or at the end of each week, sit down and identify instances where you either stuck to your productive schedule or failed in some way. In the instances where you failed, what excuses did you tell yourself? If, for example, you missed a few hours of prospecting, did you let yourself off the hook by saying you were too tired or that you’d make up the work the next day? Were you able to get back on track the next day or did your failure turn into a pattern?

Don’t be too harsh on yourself, but do recognize that these tiny decisions accumulate. Missing your prospecting time once is one thing — habitually failing to engage in this important activity leads to missed sales and missed opportunities to grow your business.

Although the time of New Year’s Resolutions is still pretty far away, it’s never too early to start thinking about how you’ll look back on your achievements throughout this year. If you want your story to be one of success — not failure — start being more mindful of your daily practices and habits and the stories you tell yourself. Remember, you can build a story on excuses, but you can’t build the kind of lifestyle you want on the tales you tell yourself!

And decide today, what are two or three daily practices that…if you repeated them daily until they became habits…would make the greatest impact in your life and business? And…then do it.

This article will be very short and to the point. So many people today are struggling with their finances in a big way. The mountains of bills keep elevating while their bank accounts keep running dry. Many are not sure of where their next meal may be coming from, or how they will get back and forth to work with a car that’s stuck in the driveway, or worse…..needs to be towed off the side of the road. Maybe for others, they inherited a home that they didn’t want, or simply couldn’t afford. To be honest, the first thing many people fall behind on…..are their mortgage payments. I feel for so many, who battle with the impending thought that foreclosure on their home is a very likely scenario. They have disdain towards the banks and say it’s all their fault for not giving them another extension. Let me let you in on a little secret…..the banks don’t really want your houses and you don’t have to ruin your credit for the next several years regardless of what you’ve heard. There’s a way out….and here’s how. Let’s BREAK THE CYCLE!



A Simple Cycle Breaker………



Sell to An Investor



There are many investors out there who will purchase your house for cash. That’s right, CASH! An investor is not going to pay full price for your house, but if you don’t have enough equity, don’t want to pay agents commissions and don’t want to make any repairs, then selling to an investor is most likely your best shot. They will buy your house “as is” and take care of all of the needed work, well after the dark cloud of foreclosure has blown past you. This will not only BREAK THE CYCLE of foreclosure, but may even put CASH in your pocket to pay for other bills and expenses…..all while saving any impending damage to your credit.

Conferences — Meeting — Events in Thessaloniki Hotels,"Conferences — Meeting — Events in Thessaloniki Hotels

Despite the difficult economic situation of Greece and the huge instability which threatens most of the sectors of the economy and of the society, some sectors grew up in the microeconomics of the city named Thessaloniki.

In the last 2 years mainly observed an increase in the sector of ​​ conferences and events organization in the city of Thessaloniki. The causes are varied. On the one side are the particular color and the great legacy of the city within the country and on the other hand are mainly the movements made by private initiative. Most hotels in Thessaloniki have added services that offer customers a well-equipped event and conference rooms. The cost of organizing a conference or an event is the city of Thessaloniki lower than in another competing city.

The hotel a.d. Imperial Palace offering two conference rooms 150 and 180 people respectively is one more reason for this increase. One of the hotels in Thessaloniki that stand out in the field of conferences and events is definitely the hotel ad Imperial Palace. The hotel conferences rooms are hosted with great success any type of event including conferences, lectures, samplings, seminars etc. Each conference room of a.d.

How to Innovate the Hotel Guest Experience to Make Millennials Happy,"Millennials are entering their prime traveling years.

The largest generation in the U.S. (25% of the country’s population), millennials (young adults born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s) also have purchasing power — by 2018, it’s estimated Millennials will drive 50% of purchase decisions.

So how can the travel and hospitality industries appeal to the Millennial guest?

By taking advantage of Millennials’ behaviors and preferences to drive innovation across the entire guest experience.

Millennials are a generation who have grown up in a technologically advanced world where traveling and communication go hand-in-hand and are easier than ever before.

Their travel behaviors and preferences reflect eight main themes: Local, Influential, Disloyal, Mobile, Adventurous, Social, Spontaneous, and Green.

Hotels that adopt these themes into their product, services and marketing are in the best position to appeal to the millennial set.

So how can hotels innovate their guest experience in a way to win over the millennial?

Build a Space to Fit Today’s Needs

Sure, it is expensive and not everyone can, but when you have the opportunity, reinvest in your public spaces to encourage social and productive guests:

Mobile devices mean guests no longer have to sit at the hotel desk or visit the (increasingly vestigial) business center to do work or sit in the hotel room to watch TV. 85% of adults ages 18–29 own a smartphone, the highest of any U.S. demographic.

Change the hotel lobby to reflect this by making it a more social, work-friendly space, where guests can plug in and connect, both online and with each other.

The Ace Hotel in New York has perfected a lobby space where you can work hard and look good doing so.

Change the Guest Room to reflect the advance of personal technology:

It used to be that when you went to a hotel, everything was better than the set up you had at home. Now, it’s increasingly the case that guests arriving at your hotel are accustomed to bigger televisions, faster Wi-Fi and more outlets. Hotels need to reinvent luxury by enabling the technological preferences of their guests.

Allow for Guests’ Self-Expression and Individuality in your hotel’s design, offerings and amenities:

Personality, authenticity and options in hotel design and offerings carries more weight for the Millennial set than the star ratings of yore. This generation cares more about amenities and the subtle look and feel of your hotel than they do about the consistent, predictable experiences perfected by brands like the Four Seasons and Marriott. Many boutiques are in a better position to capitalize on this generation’s preferences by recognizing it’s not about the hotel, it’s about the guest, and every guest is unique.

Change up the Communication Options and give your guests options beyond the in-room phone:

Millennials’ desire to control their experiences and environment extends to their communication. Hotels should meet their guests where they are, which is increasingly on mobile. Hotels should think beyond the hotel room phone (indeed, phone calls are universally in decline) and give their guests the option to tweet, text and communicate in-app with the front desk.

Control the Content by being proactive about reviews and online conversation:

Just as Millennials are more influenced by your hotel’s amenities, design and offerings than traditional rating systems, they put more stock into reviews than anything else. You can stay ahead of the conversation by asking your guests for reviews, showcasing them on your site and being as responsive to comments, questions and possible criticisms as possible. Quick, personalized responses to negative feedback is often all that’s needed to turn the disgruntled into fans for life, as well as positively influence those using reviews to make a decision about your property.

So too, mobile and text engagement tools allow hotels to connect with guests and privately resolve issues before they reach social media or TripAdvisor. Real-time communication tools empower staff to deliver timely solutions before issues escalate, as well as prompt guests for reviews after delightful experiences.

Conclusion:

Hotel brands recognize these changing preferences of their guests and beginning to adapt and innovate accordingly. Major chains, which could have resisted change, are instead proactively embracing these shifting values (Local, Influential, Disloyal, Mobile, Adventurous, Social, Spontaneous, and Green) and unveiling new projects like Cordis by Langham, Moxy by Marriott, and Canopy by Hilton. Indeed, an entire class of hotels — independents — is gaining strength based on their appeal to Millennials both now and in the future.

As the OTAs increasingly encroach on hotel revenue and the pressures of the sharing economy mount, there’s never been a better time to innovate on your guest experience to appeal to the Millennial traveler. While some of these adaptations require big budgets (lobby and guest room redesigns, for example), some innovations can be achieved with far less. Introducing mobile communication options for guests and staff costs far less than you might expect, while curating and controlling your online presence can be achieved for nothing at all.

Everybody’s a concierge. Except your hotel concierge…,"Everywhere you turn these days there’s a service offering to be your concierge. Wash.io is a laundry concierge, Operator is a shopping concierge, Shyp is a shipping concierge. Your credit card definitely offers a concierge.

But the hotel lobby concierge — the original concierge—is disappearing. And at a time when guests have come to expect more local knowledge and authenticity than ever. At a time when, more than ever, we need somebody with real local knowledge to help us sift through the noise.

Shouldn’t the rise of Airbnb with its local touch prove the importance of local expertise? Why is it that so many boutique hotels are removing rather than expanding their concierge forces?

For a few reasons:

Bad actors. Too many concierges take kickbacks. And too many guests have been burned, ending up at that same over-priced restaurant where the concierge sends everybody. In fact, many of the concierges you talk to don’t even work for the hotel—they’re third parties acting as middlemen at the expense of genuine experiences. No technology. Who wants to have to go to the lobby every time you have a question? Or make a phone call? The advice needs to be available on your phone, when you need it. Big bus tours. It’s easier than ever to put up a website and start a travel business. And many of these tour or activity providers are FAR superior to the entrenched operators. Would you rather explore a new city with these guys or on a tired double-decker bus? But most lobby concierges don’t keep up with these new companies because they have no reason to.

While Airbnb has it’s problems, any company that empowers more people to travel is alright by me. And more to the point, they’ve done a fantastic job of helping travelers get off-the-beaten path.

But hotels still have their place. Their focus on customer service is, often, unparalleled. And their ability to curate an end-to-end experience is an impressive act of creativity. But it’s time to rethink the concierge.

After all, this is the age of the concierge.",https://medium.com/@dtemple/everybody-s-a-concierge-except-your-hotel-concierge-cc878860c83,['David Temple'],2015-11-20 19:25:10.205000+00:00,"['Travel', 'Hotel', 'Concierge']"
7 reasons not to love Nigeria,"7 reasons not to love Nigeria

Having travelled the world, you get a pretty fair view on how fascinating some countries and the cultures they carry can be. In the spirit of repartee and with a pinch of salt, Jovago.com, Africa’s largest hotel booking portal presents 7 reasons why you should take a second look at the most populous black nation in the world.

1. Because their men are great lovers

Ever been kissed by a Nigerian man? They smile at you and you are hooked! There is no actual word for their form of kissing but it’s akin to having your lips plugged to a suction pipe, an embrasser avec la langue of sorts which leaves you coming back for more.

2. Because we’ve been allowed to believe that Nigerian women can’t get slim

Current diet books claim that Nigerian women are chubby because they eat only fresh beef, all day. However, the truth is that their obesity rates are lower than other parts of the continent and they feed on a diet rich in fiber. The fact that Agbani Darego went on to win the Miss World pageant in 2001 is further proof.

3. They have no chill for wildlife, too

All flying and crawling creatures are for food in this country. In 2015, millions of chickens and goats are force-fed with grass in order to produce enough meat for a single meal. Heck, there’s a part of Nigeria where dogs are considered a delicacy. How adventurous is that?!

4. Because they love humour

Have you heard a Nigerian laugh before? Utter bliss! Before the Revolution, the French invented the word l’esprit, which means ‘wit’, but the term “humour” had no comparison until this group of people were created. At the slightest tickle, they burst in rib-racking laughter with mirth bubbling from their belly. No wonder they are called the happiest people on the planet.

5. And they think their cooking is the best in the world

Nigerian’s version of a gourmet meal is a delight to eat. They boast of 5-star multichain hotels with international standard chefs and when the platter is served, the dishes are large enough to cater to a football team. Who knows, maybe this is what makes their dishes so popular. Coincidence, yeah?

6. Because they love Fela

In 1969, Fela went on tour of the United States as the first authentic black musician to play in 10 American cities. His fame did not stop there. With his quick tongue and witty disposition, he soon became a primary target of the military regime he fought against. Although, he died of AIDS and had a heavy drug problem, Fela’s music went platinum long before African music gained global recognition.

7. And they hate rock ’n’ roll

At least most of them do. It’s strange how you see them gyrating to a class of music calledafropop, which a lot of rhythm by the way and yet cringe at the sound of metallic rock. Their artistes have won countless awards around the globe and their excitement is infectious…when you are at the club, this is all that matters!

What is the Job of a Hotel Community Manager?,"Find out what it takes to be a great hotel community manager or hire one for your hotel

Social media marketing and engagement used to be what we call ‘bathroom business’ — something that a hotel’s staff could do in their downtime, a few minutes at a go, even while on the toilet.

Up until quite recently, if your hotel was doing any social media marketing at all, you already had a solid edge over your competitors because they most probably were not. A few tweets here, some Facebook posts there, and a bit of effort to keep your blog and other social media accounts fresh was all that it took to stand out and claim more market share.

Not any more.

Now, just about everyone and his dog is active on social media. There is so much competition that managing your hotel’s online community and social media marketing strategy has become a 24/7 job for properly-trained professionals. Say hello to the new role of hotel community manager.

However, while everyone knows that hotel community managers are responsible for ‘the social media stuff’ (obviously!), it still is quite unclear what HCMs should do exactly and what specific skills they need to have. Even aspiring HCMs themselves are often at a loss, let alone their prospective bosses who need to find and hire the best people for the job.

The role of hotel community manager is new and continually evolving, and with limited information available online it can be very hard to train for the job and keep up with it as it changes.

Let’s take a look at what successful hotel community managers should be doing and why they play a vital role in the hotel business.

A crucial full-time and in-house job with the hotel’s reputation at stake

Today, people carry around their social media in their pockets. This means it is practically easier for a guest with a problem or a complaint to pull out their phone and post about it on your hotel’s Facebook page for all to see than it is to ring the front desk. This is in fact what actually happens very often and at any time of the day or night, and the trend of going online to voice a grievance is steadily on the increase.

That brings us to the first and most important job of the hotel community manager: reputation management.

The primary task of an HCM is to have all eyes and ears out on the different social media channels (and also on the rest of the Internet) to monitor what people are saying about your hotel and respond appropriately. The HCM has to work together with the rest of the hotel staff so that problems are solved quickly, guests are kept happy and the hotel’s reputation remains untarnished.

It should already start to become clear that the position of hotel community manager is a full-time job that cannot be outsourced effectively or even assigned to an intern.

In fact, the HCM has to be a bridge between your hotel’s different departments, including Marketing, Reservations, Public Relations, Food and Beverage and so on, working with them to coordinate the team effort and make sure any necessary action is taken promptly.

Hotel guests obviously don’t care about what goes on behind the scenes. They just want a quick and effective solution so they can get on with enjoying their stay.

This means that a hotel community manager needs to have a solid working knowledge of the hotel, its policies, its facilities and of how the different hotel departments function together, so that any issues are addressed effectively before an online complaint has a chance to spread and go viral. It also goes without saying that excellent manners and communication skills are vital too.

Spearheading the hotel’s online presence, social media and content creation

Reacting promptly and averting potential online PR disasters is just one side of the coin.

Another key role of the hotel community manager is to take charge of your hotel’s online presence and social media outreach, which includes your content creation and distribution strategies.

Proactive online engagement is a three-pronged effort where hotels

generate and publish their own content

invite media and influential travel bloggers to stay at the hotel and report back to their audience

encourage guests to share their photos and experiences on the various social media platforms

The last point is the most important by far. Nurturing guest-generated content is key to online success because your hotel’s brand is only as valuable as your guests think it is. Besides, it goes without saying that anything a guest posts online about your hotel is going to be viewed as much more credible than if the hotel posted the same thing itself.

This means that guests should be the ones creating and sharing the bulk of the content about your hotel (which the hotel can then share and promote, of course) and it is part of the hotel community manager’s job to encourage this practice and make it as easy as possible for guests to do so.

Inviting over established media and travel bloggers to report on their stay at the hotel is another very effective online marketing strategy. It gives your hotel an excellent opportunity to reach out to an established target audience and showcase not just the hotel itself and its facilities, but also the surrounding area and destination as a whole.

And, of course, hotel community managers should have good production skills of their own, so that they can create interesting in-house photos, videos, blog posts and other content, which can be shared by guests and the media alike.

Roping in staff, building personal brands and promoting the hotel together

Social media engagement is not a job for the hotel community manager to do alone.

Part of the role of HCM is, in fact, to take the lead in the hotel’s digital transformation and community building. This involves training other staff members in social media marketing and supervising a coordinated effort to interact with current and prospective guests both online and face-to-face on a daily basis.

This includes teaching social media best practices and helping staff create and manage their own personal brand profiles on the different social networks. It is important for the hotel community manager and also other members of the hotel staff to project strong personal brands through their social network accounts. This is because people respond much better to someone who comes across as a real living and breathing person rather than an anonymous face on the Internet.

A good and friendly relationship with guests puts the hotel community manager and other staff in an excellent position to then promote hotel events (both before and afterwards) and launch and manage competitions and promotions. This also helps a lot with another aspect of the HCM job description, which is to upsell in-house guests on hotel products, as well as trips, excursions, restaurant meals and other services offered by the hotel’s partner businesses.

It goes without saying that hotel community managers need a good dose of charisma and leadership skills to go with their social media expertise and the other qualities we have discussed.

Successful hotel community managers need to be able to prove their worth

What we have described so far is routine, day-to-day work for an HCM, but there are are other tasks that also need to be done from time to time, such as networking with your hotel’s strategic partners, seeking out new ones and building new business relationships.

A hotel community manager should also follow competitor hotels and similar hotels around the world, to learn what they are doing and stay ahead of the game. Then there is the task of overseeing SEO and other paid placement advertising, which means HCMs should have a good understanding of how search engine ranking and ad buying work.

And to top it all off, successful hotel community managers have to be able to communicate effectively with the hotel’s management and show the fruits of their work.

While social media is not a distribution channel, good HCMs do help increase both direct and indirect bookings, although the cause and effect relationship can be hard to actually demonstrate in practice. And yet, from the shareholders’ point of view, the ultimate measure of success of anything a hotel does is, of course, the bottom line, and it is up to hotel community managers to prove their worth to the hotel brand and justify their salary.

It’s going to be easier than ever to excel as a hotel community manager

All in all, being a hotel community manager is a challenging role, but a fun and rewarding one too when it is done properly.

And helping hotel community managers succeed and prosper is exactly what we are setting out to do. We’ve got over a decade of social media marketing experience under our belt, as well as a solid hands-on HCM track record, that has won critical acclaim.

3 great reasons to take a serviced apartment,"3 great reasons to take a serviced apartment

St Dunstan’s Court Apartments, London

Serviced apartments are a fantastic alternative to hotels for relocation assignees around the world, offering tangible benefits to both the employee and the employer.

Skyline Worldwide’s Business Intelligence Manager for the EMEA region, Abi Lucy, tells us about just a few of the advantages of using serviced accommodation when relocating and travelling.

1. More space and flexibility

Serviced apartments offer more spacious accommodation compared to traditional hotels, often providing a living room, a kitchen, a separate bedroom and bathroom, ensuring that the guest can experience a more “home from home” atmosphere.

Guests are able to continue their typical routines without disruption, which can reduce the time it takes for them to settle in to their new environment. This flexibility isn’t restricted by specific breakfast times or rigid guidelines when staying in the apartment — serviced accommodation allows the guests to live their way.

2. Higher quality

At Skyline we pride ourselves on the quality and high standard of our apartments, and this doesn’t end with the permanent fixtures within the apartments. Not only do we source outstanding accommodation in key locations, we also provide 24 hour meet and greet services — so that the assignee will always be met personally by one of our team, complimentary internet access and Sky TV, and we ensure that the apartments are finished to the very highest specifications.

3. Cost effectiveness

The opportunity for cost savings is one of the biggest benefits for both the employer and the assignee. The facilities provided within the apartments, such as the full kitchen, allow the guest to avoid eating out, submitting expenses and waiting for reimbursement — so the employer is able to reduce per diem allowances for F&B, laundry and hotel-type incidentals.

The potential extent of savings can be increased considerably when two or three colleagues share an apartment, particularly for stays of 90 days plus. These savings can be as much as 50%, for a 2 bedroom apartment which would be more cost effective than 2 studios.

These cost savings can impact enormously on the overall price of the relocation process, as temporary accommodation can be one of the most significant outlays of any international assignment.

Branded watches and jewelleries at great discounts in UK,"Branded watches and jewelleries at great discounts in UK

A branded watch or jewellery represents success. When a person wears something expensive, adorable and trendy at the same time, he or she is looked upon with respect. These products not only symbolise dignity, but also add stars to the personality of who wears them. In this world, wearing luxury watches or accessories is a trend. That is undeniable fact that no one in general can resist products from top brands. Even a hundred ordinary products cannot make for one single branded product. And that’s why they are in great demand and customers from all over the world want to get hold of them as precious collections.

It is not that the luxury and branded products are priced high just because they are from a reputed brand. They have touches from international designers and boast of superior technologies, which make them precious in every way. One common issue faced by the fans of the biggest brands is the price involved with the products. No doubt the well to do customers can purchase these luxurious items at will; but the average customers sometimes have to get their desires crushed when the economy is not helping much. This is very tragic!

There is a solution. Certain online pawn shop outlets let these enthusiastic fans purchase great discounted products from the top brands around the world. Especially in a country like UK, purchasing DKNY watches online at great discounts from online pawn shops is quite possible. It is really possible to get products that are a little old, but in great shape and with a warranty. For instance these online stores have Rolex watches, branded accessories and Jewellery from Thomas Sabo all sold at super rebates.

Changes in the Hotel Industry,"“Today,” says Mr Marriott, “guests check in, they go to their room, drop their stuff. Then they go back to the lobby and hang out with friends or work on their computer.” As a result, lobby designs must now accommodate what he calls “this new desire to connect”. Take Courtyard, for example, one of the company’s cheaper brands. “In an old Courtyard hotel, two or three years ago, there was nothing going on in the lobby,” says Mr Marriott. “Today we have a bistro. And we have a lot of cubby places where people can get together.”

Bill Marriott has spent 60 years working for his family hotel group and talked to The Economist about how he’s seen the industry change. Besides making the lobby a more exciting place to hang out, Marriott says they’ve made desks smaller in hotel rooms to provide more space and because people just like working from bed. Also: guests don’t really use the closet and just grab things from their suitcases on the luggage rack.

The not unpacking of the suitcase is definitely true (for me at least). All of the hotels I’ve stayed at in the last two years were for weddings, and the main reasons for hanging out in the lobby were because it was the place that made the most sense to meet before heading out, and because they were always handing out free cookies. Suggestion to hotels: more free cookies, please.

Festivals of Udaipur and their Significance,"Festivals of Udaipur and their Significance

Festivals are an important aspect of Indian culture, and there’s no way you can come to India and miss the many festivals celebrated here. To get a flavour of this country and its culture, you should visit the many states during some of the festivals. One of the country’s most culturally-rich states is Rajasthan. Udaipur is an important city in the state, and is known for its vibrant culture. While Diwali, Holi etc are festivals common to a vast majority of the country, here are some festivals unique to the Udaipur region, and the significance of each of them:

Speaking of summer…

Gangaur festival: A summer festival, Gangaur / Gauri pooja is performed by women seeking a happy married life. The goddess is also a symbol of fertility and harvest, apart from fidelity in marriage. The festival is celebrated after Holi, and involves collecting ashes post the Holi fire. Barley and wheat seeds are buried in the ashes, and watered till they germinate. One week after Holi, the idols of Isar (Ishwar) and Gauri are made. Gauri is a spring-related festival and is all about abundance, growth and prosperity.

Heralding the rainy season

Hariyali Amavasya: This festival is celebrated during the monsoon, and the scale of celebrations is really huge. Hariyali means greenery, and therefore, a sapling is planted on this day. Also, the festival marks the beginning of the rainy season. Amavasya is the moonless night, and Lord Shiva is worshipped on this occasion. People fast the whole day on the day of Hariyali Amavasya. The festival/fair is held at the Sahelion ki Bari and Fatehsagar Lake. Sahelion ki Bari is a popular haunt in Udaipur, and is a well known garden.

· Celebrating the arrival of spring

Mewar festival: Indian festivals are all about celebrating seasons, be it summer, spring or the monsoon. The Mewar festival marks the arrival of spring, and is celebrated with great pomp and enthusiasm across the town of Udaipur. Processions of Isar and Gangaur (Gauri) are taken out across the city of Udaipur. The procession culminates at Lake Pichola’s Gangaur Ghat. The festival is also marked with music and dance programmes. To catch the full glory of the Mewar festival, you should visit the areas in and around Bagore ki Haveli or Bharatiya Lok Kala Mandal. You can also enjoy the spectacular fireworks display as part of the festival.

Stay and local experience

Udaipur is called the ‘Venice of the East’, thanks to the many lakes in the city. You should visit this city of lakes and palaces to enjoy the essence of Rajasthan. Udaipur is also a great place to explore if you are a foodie, and want to taste the local culinary delights. In terms of accommodation, there are plenty of options on offer, from a range of medium and budget accommodation choices to 5 star hotels in Udaipur. There are many resorts in Udaipur that offer a rich experience, in terms of food and cultural extravaganza.",https://medium.com/@daisyjohn/festivals-of-udaipur-and-their-significance-7bb8e66c8f80,['Daisy John'],2015-12-23 06:02:02.806000+00:00,"['Festivals', 'Udaipur', 'Hotels']"
Rocking The Daisies: The Eco-Friendly Music Festival,"I recently attended Rocking the Daisies, a four-day music festival in Cape Town, South Africa. The event took place October 1st through the 4th. This year was the festival’s 10th birthday and the really went all out for the occasion. With 9 stages and over 22,000 people in attendance, the festival was an amazing scene to behold. There was a wide range of music styles from jazz to reggae to Cuban to funk.

Some of the larger names to headline the event include: The Kooks, Milky Chance, The Cat Empire, Crookers, Scuba, Thomas Jack and Betoko. The festival featured over 180 acts, including both local performers and larger, internationally recognized groups.

Furthermore, the Daisies coincided with the Rugby World Cup this year. In the Rubgy World Cup Village, attendees could go watch South Africa or other participants play their matches, witch provided a very electric atmosphere to watch the games.

What makes Rocking the Daisies particular unique, is the message of greening and being socially and environmentally conscious. SA’s Premier Music & Lifestyle Eco Festival is committed to limiting its impact on the environment through the reduction in trash and litter. Festival attendees can regularly be found assisting the festival crews in keeping the area clean throughout the weekend.

As South Africa’s premier eco-friendly music and lifestyle festival, Rocking the Daisies has continued to raise the bar, incorporating innovative environmentally conscious products into the festival and spreading the message of ‘play hard, tread lightly.’ The festival utilizes solar and wind powered electricity, biodiesel generators, LED lighting, biodegradable soaps, recycling and tree planting initiatives to name a few. Rocking the Daisies is committed to becoming the most carbon neutral green event possible.

In the Green Village, you could tap into “your inner Eco-Warrior” with the solar-powered Hemp Stage lineup, environmentally-conscious vendors and much more earth-friendly activities.

Rocking the Daisies was an amazing opportunity to enjoy amazing musical acts, both local and international, while taking part in a festival that is committed to improving the environment at the same time.",https://medium.com/@mackprioleau/rocking-the-daisies-the-eco-friendly-music-festival-747a8c2495c8,['Mack Prioleau'],2015-10-25 23:53:47.151000+00:00,"['Festival', 'Travel']"

I Cried on my First Day as a Digital Nomad,"..and I couldn’t be more happy that I did.

I didn’t cry because of sadness; noone has passed away. I didn’t cry because I was unhappy with something in my life. I didn’t cry to get what I want. I didn’t cry because I hurt myself. Nor did I cry because I wanted to cry.

I think — although this has never happened to me — I cried because of the happiness of the moment I was experiencing.

This sounds fucking weird right? Especially as an emotionally secure London boy who has just moved away to Thailand… but this is the only way I can rationalise it.

If you care to join me, I’d love to tell you why I think I cried… this is going to be a ramble!

I’m really only 2 days into my journey. It’s the beginning. Although I’ve been away over a week, I’ve spent most of it in Mumbai for a friend’s wedding. There were expectations and things to do, places to be etc. I felt as if I was in transit between 2 different lives. I’ve been waiting for this moment for years… and I’m so happy I’m here, doing it.

Yesterday I met the most awesomely inspiring dude, Peter — levels.io — He’s building cool sh_t to help people live and work where they want. He’s also the guy behind 12 Startups in 12 months. Anyway, he got me setup in my first co-working space, introduced me to a few people and got excited about what I’m working on — Pillow Talk.

I’ve got purpose. I believe I can build something that can make people’s life better, and I’m making it happen.

I’m learning. I’m enjoying a new culture, picking up a new language, smiling to strangers, nodding when saying thanks. All these small things are just fascinating. I absolutely love it.

Anyway, I had my first good night sleep since arriving into Thailand followed by a delightfully healthy noodle soup breakfast. I walked to the co-working space, hacked away and built stuff. I had a couple of coffees, had a ride on the back of a moped and ended up in a beautiful park where the locals were celebrating Loy Krathong.

These lanterns just lit up the lake. They moved slowly, with the light glistening on the ripples of the water. Each lantern has a candle and incense, so the whole park was filled with this beautiful aroma. Many people were in couples, praying, and delicately placing the lanterns in the water. I sat there watching the fish jumping up and splashing. Everyone, all around me, just looked so happy and literally, just like that, I started shedding tears. I couldn’t quite believe it myself. Few things have ever made me cry.

It was as if at that moment everything came together. I was there, just observing, experiencing and feeling. Not the past. Not the future. Just being. There. Present. It felt fucking amazing.

I wish that you will experience this joy too. I’d love to hear similar stories.",https://drrn.net/i-cried-on-my-first-day-as-a-digital-nomad-4a099dfab71,['Darren John Smith'],2015-10-13 09:38:00.798000+00:00,"['Digital Nomads', 'Thailand', 'Festival']"
The Nu World At Large (A Review),"I was asked to review and photograph the 2015 Cape Town Nu World Festival, so I did.

Originally posted in July 2015—but with a few amendments made.

THURSDAY

Me: Hello Facebook, I would like to attend the Nu World Music Fest by means of work. Can you provide? Facebook: Yes my brother.

FRIDAY

I’m inside an email searching for my media pass while doggedly manoeuvring through rainy-day Cape Town traffic. The first act already started two hours ago yet here I am on a rendezvous with old compatriot and Black Major’s artist representative Aaron Peters to chaperone Aero Manyelo and Skinny (Blackfoot Phoenix) and Tristan (Thris) — the Boiler Room/NTS DJs — to and from the Colosseum Hotel in Century City. I took him up on this offer because I thought it would be an interesting starting point for my festival report; truth be told, I just wanted to meet some famous people. But things are not going according to plan: Tristan and Skinny missed their flight from Joburg and the weather is getting worse. They’re late, and having only just picked up my camera equipment and car’s backseats from home, I’m late too. Rats! I thought there would be time to impress them with the smooth tunes I just so happen to have in my car — playlists that I made for them this morning — while driving to the clothing sale at Superior Goods, enjoying some free whiskey, picking up some sweet kush (the DJs want a pick-me-up) and just chewing the fat together, you know? Shoot the breeze on the wonderful/atrocious state of the music industry and whatnot.

But no, Aaron and I are now in the reception hall at the Colosseum Hotel, spread out on a shiny couch underneath a sparkling jellyfish chandelier, with Nthato (Spoek Mathambo of Fantasma), Marvin (DJ Spoko) and Aero Manyelo flanking us on either side. We’re waiting for Tristan and Skinny, who’ve gone missing. Aaron’s on the phone: “Yes? Yeah, we’re almost ready. No, the Boiler Room guys are taking a shower. We’ll be at the festival in ten minutes.” He repeats this to roughly seven different callers. Tristan finally makes his appearance, looking tired but smiling: “I think Skinny ran into the shopping mall to buy a pair of Nikes.”

Upon arrival at the festival, set inside Cape Town’s city hall, I immediately head for the food stalls. Sitting on a bench marvelling at the pale sandstone exterior of the building, I’m drinking a beer and eating stir-fried pork courtesy of Lotus Food Trucks. Through the door in front of me is the main stage; Fantasma is performing their brand of noisy rap-rock punkedelia, or whatever. The sound is messy, but then again, I’ve never understood what Fantasma wants to achieve in a live setting. As I stare, Aero appears to my left, giving me a wink and a snap of his fingers. “Happiness costs R50!” I say, lifting my bento box with a smile. He laughs and walks on. Aero is cool. I get up to have a closer look at Fantasma (Spoek is dressed in a pastel-neon overcoat) only to find the sound echoed and layered beyond comprehension. A few feet away from me, a friend is dancing with eyes closed. I sidle up next to her. She yells into my ear: “I’ve been waiting to see these guys for a million years. This venue is so beautiful..” I immediately wonder if I was being too critical of the sound. She continues: “…but how f*cking bad is this sound?” Phew. Finishing with Fantasma and about to turn away, my friend bids me farewell: “I recently discovered you can smoke rose petals and mint instead of tobacco.” She produces a tin filled with rolled cigarettes. “I lined them with THC oil that I made from scratch. Enjoy!” I pocket the joint. I’ll save it for a rainy day.

The downpour is intensifying. I venture upstairs into the tail end of Paul Waxon’s set (so far, so smooth) before making my way to the media hall, wanting to pen down some initial thoughts, including: “New addition to the festival: a mini market of clothes, jewellery and merchandise” and “Attendance is down, diversity is up” and “There’s like 3/4 less white people this year; do white people hate rain?”

Everyone seems to be on the balcony, so I join them for a cigarette. Says one greying journalist to another: “It’s good to see so many people here. It’s such a lovely festival.” She takes a deep suck on her fag, one eye drooped with satisfaction. “I’m very excited to be here.” I head back to the DJ stage where Thris is laying the beats down thick while Blackfoot Phoenix readies his side of the deck, and the floor is pumping. You need more than one pair of eyes to sidestep this crowd of merciless groovers — suddenly I’m spun around to face a man and woman holding onto each other, ready with their best “this-is-my-everything” pose. Without focusing, I take a shot, smile and turn away — straight into Louis Pienaar, keyboardist of Bateleur. Time to smoke those rose petals.

Passing the food court and upstairs bar to where last year’s DJ stage used to be, the space has now been transformed into a strange umbrella installation. I’m unsure whether the umbrellas are purely decorative or meant to keep us dry; either way they’re not very effective. Back at the main stage with my friend Lentswe and company, Simphiwe Dana creates the gravitational pull I’ve been waiting for; she has a stage presence so strong that I am transported elsewhere, thrown off course towards a warmer, drier planet (I am stoned). Jazz, Afro-Soul, “new Miriam Makeba” and “Firebrand” — sure, she’s all that, but judging by the attitude of her dancing and smiling admirers, she’s the little sister who made it big and it feels great to see that in action; to see someone perceived as 100% special and deserving it every bit.

Shane Cooper’s Card On Spokes project delivers anaesthesia-dipped beats from a sensitive world; try as he might to be straight dope, Shane’s musical chops shine through, and that’s a good thing: blessed is the crowd that takes these notes with good strides. Things are picking up; downstairs at the bar, caught in a conversation between my friend Lentswe and Siya (Umlilo, not performing) I toss back a shot of tequila. Next thing I know I’m directing a confusing photoshoot of Siya having a fake meltdown: “Never stop taking photos. You’re a terrible photographer. I’m your muse. Let’s do this again. You think this is original?!

Jbjabkjadbva

It’s late and I’m just about ready to go home, but there’s one more act I should see. Unfortunately Riky Rick has missed his flight; somewhat of a trend at this year’s fest. Thris is covering for him — a welcome change, seeing as many acts lacked transition music between sets — playing to a small but loyal crowd. One last victory lap around the venue to say my goodbyes and I’m out. On my exit, I can hear Riky Rick’s arrival on stage, with the disheartened greeting: “What’s up Nu World! Sorry I’m late. There’s not a lot of you left, but…”

SATURDAY

Slow thoughts, a sore throat and a banana. I check my phone for the time and missed calls; it’s ten in the morning, and no word from Aaron. I was supposed to continue with my chaperoning duties today, but assumed Aaron and the DJs would be too hungover to wake up in time. Turns out I was right. Foiled again, I need a rinse; it’s time to go surfing, so I dial up some friends. Later, on the drive to Muizenberg, my friend Sean notes, “The festival brings together a great bunch of people. Everybody felt friendly and forthcoming.” Smaller as the crowd did seem, I never felt trapped in a conversation. This is an important subject within festivals that is often overlooked; while there might have been snags in the act transitions and the sound (City Hall was designed to expand acoustic sound, and thus doesn’t play well with electronics) the people who attend the festival with you, who truly appreciate the sounds, makes or breaks it for everybody. The sun is out and I’m feeling refreshed. I just hope this weather lasts the night.

Native Young’s anthemic pop comes bouncing down the corridor while I wait for Sean to get his ticket. Inside the main hall, infatuated fans hang from frontman Yannick Meyer’s lips. With a wardrobe treading the line between ’60s psychedelia and your local church nativity play, this band preaches their afro-pop gospel with giddy abandon, and the crowd believes in it; for them, this magic is real. And why not? Looking like a cult-abducted Kevin Parker, dressed in a shiny headband and full-length dream coat, Meyer wields his kalimba like a bible. Closing with “Kings”, the saxophone blares over the combined chants of the band: “Kings of our universe/standing with their feet on the earth.” The crowd barely touches the ground. Compared to Friday night, this is the kind of opener Nu World Fest deserves.

After their set I head backstage to catch a word with Yannick, but blocking my path are some twenty odd American exchange students with similar, albeit loaded, intentions. “They’re so cool,” the one girl tells me, “I just wanna tell them how awesome they are. Do you know them? Oh my god no way, you’re so cool!” Stealthily I fade into the background. I need a break after that performance, and with Zuko Collective starting soon, I want to head upstairs. Nearing the DJ booth I find my feet suddenly performing a U-turn; seems that I still can’t get these babies anywhere near Balkanology music. I think I’ll wonder around for a while.

It’s halfway through the first Zuko Collective song. Lead singer Nozuko Mapoma pierces the concert hall with her heart-wrenching wail while thrashing a cowbell, and I think: Bjork, if she was from Johannesburg. Behind her I see the drummer and bassist power duo; they’re absolutely shredding it, and I think: I’d watch those two as an act by themselves. Next I’m transfixed by the vision that is Thandiwe Khoza, standing closest to where I’m taking photos from, and I think: Sho! She is beautiful. Take a step back and suddenly you realise this isn’t a single-minded band but a talented group of creatives who share Nozuko’s passion for music; she just provides the lead (and heartfelt messages between songs); that and Zweli Mthembu’s clear influence carried over from his main band and last year’s standouts — The Brother Moves On — has made me a fan.

I’m on the prowl, looking to hand out sneak-attack hugs. They don’t always work out to be as cute as I’d expect, but, as usual, an opportunity has presented itself and I cannot look the other way. Aware I’m possibly being watched by several people in the vicinity, I creep up on a fellow photographer standing nearby…

“WAAAAAA!”

“AAAAH! JOHAN!”

“WAAAAAA!”

“NOOO! WHY!?”

“Hello! Who are you taking photographs for?”

She’s here as Bateleur’s photographer. We’re leaning against the stage, chatting about the festival turnout and yesterday’s awful sound, but also about matters of the heart — there’s always time for that. Nicolaas Van Reenen, the lead guitarist and vocalist of Bateleur, walks past us onstage. Jess, the photographer, and I stare at him while whispering his name loud as we can. If we catch his attention we’ll feel validated for being playful. If we’re ignored, we look stupid. “I think we look pretty stupid right now,” Jess remarks.

Bateleur are here today as veterans. I was there when they played the first World Music Festival back in 2012. This is their first show in months, and with these opening notes from Odon Human’s trumpet, I’m assured that they’ve retained their sense of wonder. Standing next to me, Nate, an American from Massachusetts, says of the band: “They sound like Sigur Ros in their quieter moments, but then I also hear…” He pauses in thought. Only a handful of bands can complete that sentence, so I venture with Explosions in the Sky. Nate agrees. “Yeah man,” he smiles, “that’s totally what it is!” But Bateleur can never be attributed to just one sound. I see them as the sum of many parts. They apply a democratic approach to their writing process so that we, the listeners, are essentially presented with six distinct personalities pretending to be one person in a big coat; Muppet Man, if you will. Yup, that’s right– Bateleur is a beautifully echoed, stylishly executed Muppet Man. It’s lovely having them back.

I’m in Bateleur’s dressing room with Louis and Nic, waiting for the others. We’re sitting on a window ledge drinking wine and smoking cigarettes, discussing and celebrating the show. I don’t think I’m supposed to be there and neither does the security guard, but Louis convinces him otherwise. I share some of my field reporting with them: one of the things I heard was that their sound was a bit “underwatery.” Nic agrees with this, saying it lacked some kick. Altogether they’re pleased though, and soon we’re joined by Ma’or (the lead festival organiser) and Thandi from Zuko Collective, both praising Bateleur’s performance. With newfound excitement in the air, we head out to shake our limbs to the Bacardi House of Spoek Vs. Spoko. They’re being announced as we enter the room, and in classic DJ Spoko style, the beat drops in with full hi-hats, no fade-ins. Welcome, friends. You’ve just reached the inside of a Fizz-Pop.

Don’t you just love it when a band knows how to utilise backup dancers that are not only present on cue, but also dominate? Dressed like an ’80s Michael Jackson undertaker, Kanda Bongo Man, hailed as the king of Kwassa Kwassa, graces the main stage with such an ensemble. As is the dance style, my hips move back and forth while my hands move to follow my hips. I’m not doing it very well; in fact, everyone seems to have mutated the kwassa into their own goofball versions. Ducking out for a quick beer run, it appears Mokoomba have succeeded Kanda Bongo Man in my absence, matching their enthusiasm to make it easy for the crowd to stick to the party. With a sincere nod to KBM, they open with an infectious highlife jam, but I have a feeling they’re looking to peak the previous vibe before moving into a new one. Indeed, abandoning all instruments, the four men jump to the front and perform an impeccable boyband dance routine. I’m seeing most of this through a camera and it feels like the MTV Base Music Awards, shaping these acts into household heroes. But as soon as they’ve peaked, they stop us in our tracks. The yellow lights fade into a soft blue. It’s time for “Masangango,” a thrilling, spectral divergent delivered by lead vocalist Mathias Muzaza, dressed in simple but effective black and white. Slowly he entrances the crowd with a sacrificial hymn. As it ends, the drums kick in, the lights turn on and the people whose eyes were closed, open them again.

As I said before, I like Aero Manyelo. He’s got this earnest vibe about him that really resonates in his music. I mean, during his set he says stuff like “Okay, I’m gonna count us down and then we gonna jump. Okay, we gonna jump… We gonna jump… We gonna jump…” eventually concluded with, “Okay let’s jump! Let’s jump!” — it’s cheesy, but it makes you like him more. This wouldn’t be the case if he played your run-of-the-mill “World Music” DJ selections, but as you might suspect, he doesn’t. Aero Manyelo, like his name, is kak fresh. He enjoys himself while he plays. He’s blurring the lines of when the festival will end; in fact I’m caught in limbo, wondering if I’ll dance here every night for the rest of the week. This is the boss level and these are its die-hard challengers. If this is Bowser’s castle, we’re all Mario; as with most endings, our princess is in another castle. Maybe we’ll find her next time.

I gave my number to a lot of foreigners tonight, promising to update them on gigs and festivals in Cape Town, like I’m suddenly so involved in the music scene after covering just one festival. If that were true, I’d feel comfortable saying the festival is still a bit too expensive and needs to tighten up its info for the casual festival goer; People still don’t know how to find their way around; A few acts didn’t play when they were supposed to, which is fine unless no prior notice is given; Nobody likes it when musicians miss their flights (we paid for those flights); Last year’s sense of tension has been lost to a vibe that’s at times overly relaxed; More so than last year, the Lightbulb Sessions seem like an afterthought — either scrap it or punt it. Surrender us to the Nu. But hey, I’m just a guy who needed a ticket. On my way downstairs, Sean is keen to crash at mine. We exit and walk the street towards my car, worn out and sweaty.

Looking back at Dour Festival: Radio United.,"25 volunteers passionate about radio, 8 local radio stations/media labs, 8 stages to cover with more than 230 groups/acts in different genres. That was Radio United at Dour Festival. Never before has radio been so full of spirit, passion and endurance, because this year’s edition of Dour Festival was hot in every sense of the word.

The 26th edition of Dour festival meant more than 135 000 tickets sold, 60 000 km in travels and temperatures rising up to 33° Celsius. The festival saw the light in 1989 and has since then evolved into one of the best medium-sized European alternative festivals. Dour basically covers anything from death methal, slash, hip hop, rock, and a great deal of electronic acts. Besides its wide variety of genres, being in Belgium, its location is within driving distance from France, Germany, Holland and the UK.

Apart from a main stage, all other stages are fully decked tents with a capacity between 7000–9000 people. During the evening there are some gaps in the program here and there, which minimises those dreadful clashes. In all, a delicious recipe for a great festival. Still, it remains difficult to fully grasp this festival in just one visit. And if you’re not able to make it, there must be another way to enjoy it. This is where Radio United builds a bridge between the festival and the people. It dives into the vibrant pool of musical diversity and unique atmosphere and molds it into an audio-visual journey through radio, video and social media.

Radio United is a co-operation of independent radio stations and medialabs, launched in 2012. Since then, it has been a strong radio presence covering the whole festival, with 10 hours of non stop live radio and video streaming a day, interviews, audio and video documentaries. Moreover, Radio United has been the only Flemish radio represented at this Walloon festival. Knowing that Belgium is politically and culturally divided in two, this fact is considerably significant.

Hundreds of mails were sent to arrange interviews, material was gathered, meetings were held and a mobile studio was built. So after weeks of preparation, the Radio United crew arrived at Dour Festival. A cosy camp spot was created and the bonding over music could start, while sharing a bottle of water in moments with very high temperatures, or while putting on rubber boots and chatting under umbrellas during heavy rain fall.

Every day started with dividing the tasks equally, ranging from presenting, radio production, live audio captations, preparing interview questions, interviewing, editing and adding that content to the daily shows. A quick visit to the press room before each interview had to ensure nothing had changed in order to continuously respect the agreements made with every artist, artist manager or label.

Radio United covered a wide range of musical genres and interviewed a lot of local and international acts at any hour of the day and sometimes even exclusively. For one, Radio United got an exclusive interview with Claptone, spoke with Cid Rim at 1.30 AM, had a chat with Doctor P and stayed up until 4 AM for a session with Wilkinson.

All this was done by the joined forces of 25 volunteers who each brought their own skills, juice and personality to the table. The daily activities were organised meticulously, with great consideration of the individual requests of each act and with a high level of mutual cooperation. After sometimes suffering through long hours, making deadlines and battling the forces of nature, the crew found the time to relax, enjoy a meal and a drink together and join the party with the other thousands of visitors.

Inspiration comes when you least expect it, but when you put together 25 people who are all their for the same purpose and with the same passion, you see that inspiration being transformed into a admirable dedication, solidarity and inexhaustable drive for creating dazzling, sometimes unexpected results. It basically exhibits why the majority of people do anything: joy. In this case, it is joy times 25. And that was Radio United.",https://medium.com/@ClassyLassy_e/looking-back-at-dour-festival-radio-united-a7e491f9f68d,[],2015-10-21 13:03:27.788000+00:00,"['Radio', 'Festival']"

My Circle of Light,"I’ve recently been attending here in Moscow the 5th edition of the Circle of Light Festival.

The concept is pretty simple, amazing buildings squares places animated in light shows created by different artists from all over the world.

The result is fantastically impressive. My favorite place to attend this festival was the Bolshoi Theater in the very city center. The building in itself, stunning by day, becomes a real wonder during this festival.

Getting out of the metro station, taking the good exit of course (here I was lucky enough to be guided to that one), I suddenly face a totally different square and building than the one I knew. People all around crowding the place to enjoy a show of magical lights lighting up the theatre. I was now in a fairy Moscow.

From my favorite very ‘Bolshoi Like’ traditional theme playing Tchaikovsky and screening some ballerinas to the most futuristic theme inviting a spaceship to crash the building on a techno/deep house music background, or Historical theme going over some part of Russian past. Even a vibrating ‘Galaxy Bolshoi S6’ for commercials. Unrealistic but true, nobody took the call. I also liked a lot all the foreign projects invited to participle to the festival and their creative ideas on how to mix their culture and the local one, very colorful ‘Mexico’ and ‘India’.

I so much loved it that I was ready to watch it a second time in a row, if it wasn’t the cold.",https://medium.com/@geoffroypetit/my-circle-of-light-1250e565d426,['Geoffroy Petit'],2015-10-21 10:09:05.579000+00:00,"['Moscow', 'Travel', 'Festival']"
Beware the barrenness of a busy life.,"Beware the barrenness of a busy life.

We are born in a country of festivals where birthdays and death anniversaries bear more significance that the life-story. The day marks the beginning of a Hindu New year and the return of Lord Ram to Ayodhya. But who cares about that ! Now is the time when media is flooded with discussions on ‘Ram was a bad husband’ or ‘Ram bears no significance in the 21st century’ and even ‘Indian gods are all killers and war maniacs’. Surely whatever the truth is, Ramayana and Mahabharatha can be counted as World’s best sellers (Fiction) with global reach to billions. You might not be able to feel the Diwali but surely you can hear and smell this season of smoke and noise.

We are in the times when economies all around the globe are in downfall and some nations are fighting for their sustainable existence. And surely India too. A nation whom the world recognizes as a land of elephants, snake charmers and poverty.

But this is the magical day which has often proved all the economists wrong.

Before 10–15 years, Diwali celebrations comprised of getting your house cleaned and whitewashed before Diwali, buying new clothes, enjoying sweets, meeting friends and lightening clay diyas.Whitewashing has given way to choosing from a plethora of expensive paints for your house. Branded clothes have replaced new clothes and electronic decoration has dethroned the traditional diyas and candles. Wherever they are used, it is their modern avatars- artistically shaped diyas, Chinese lanterns and aromatic candles. Sweets are being gradually replaced by chocolates and cupcakes (those gold foil covered Swiss chocolates or better to say ‘Bilayati Laddoo’ which a traditional Indian will attempt to eat without even removing the wrap) and people have little time and patience to meet friends and relative, let alone the neighbors.

Diwali isn’t what it used to be. It’s not just that India’s festival of lights but should now be more appropriately called as the Festival of Chinese lights because china’s where they all come from. Essence is there, but the flavors have changed, drastically. Dhanteras, which falls 2 days before Diwali, was earlier believed to be a day of Yam, the god of death, is worshiped for protection from untimely death. Some consider it auspicious to buy precious metals like gold or silver on Dhanteras for good luck. Now it’s more about a day to buy sleek I-pods, shiny new laptops, Smartphones, tablets and much more.

It’s not a festival which India used to celebrate out of faith. It was more serene, more pious. But now, it’s commercialized. It’s more of a show. Now it’s the official day and opportunity to show-off, prove others the purchasing power and social status is better than others. What’s more to say about crackers and fireworks, they are loud enough to confuse people if it was a cracker or some terrorist attack.

All the discussions lead us to one thing, especially counting the urban youth count and educated internet savvy India that whatever the mainstream thinks can be changed and its just the way we celebrate has changed.",https://medium.com/@saurabhpareek/beware-the-barrenness-of-a-busy-life-9302c104d802,['Saurabh Pareek'],2015-10-16 08:54:43.437000+00:00,"['Diwali', 'Festival', 'India']"
Salesforce Deployment,"Salesforce Deployment

There are many ways to deploy to Salesforce platform, using Change Sets, Eclipse, ANT or any combination of these. All of these techniques have different pros and cons and have been discussed million times by now. I am going to discuss only ANT which looks the perfect tool to me. Here is the three-step deployment process.

First create a list of artifacts in an XML file. These artifacts are classes, pages, workflows, approval processes and e.t.c. This list is called package.xml in ANT language. Its a very simple XML document with very few tags inside. After creating the package.xml, you retrieve these artifact’s source code from your source salesforce server which is your sandbox most of the time and save them locally. This can be done by executing one of the tasks of ANT and package.xml from previous step is used for this ANT task. When you have all the artifacts and source code downloaded locally, you push them to your target salesforce server which is a production server most likely.

#1 is time taking and tedious job and has more chances of important artifacts not being included in the list and is done manually by administrators, architects and developers. When you miss an artifact, you pay the price by a failed deployment.

In order to avoid any error, I have created a tool called Package Generator which generates package.xml file for all the artifacts which have been created/modified since your last deployment. Its an ANT task and works just like other tasks provided by Salesforce. It uses metadata API’s to pull metadata and filter them based on the create/modified date. Its available to download from here.

#2 and #3 are also done by executing ANT tasks provided by Salesforce.

In order to setup for ANT, please follow the steps in this guide. Please note that you will need to install JDK version 8 since package generator task is not supported by older Java versions.

After you are done with the guide, please go to this repository and download packagegenerator.jar file and copy into the lib folder inside your ANT home.

Now you are ready to rock. Execute all three tasks generatepackage, retrievepackage and deploypackage from following build.xml.

<project name=”Deployment Script”

default=”generatepackage” basedir=”.”

xmlns:sf=”antlib:com.salesforce”> <property file=”build.properties”/>

generatepackage Task

First you declare the ANT target and name it. This name is used to call it from command prompt just like any other ANT task. After that, you define the task using taskdef tag since its not a default task by salesforce but a custom task and than after the definition, you basically invoke it and pass all the parameters needed for the task. Parameters include username, password and server url. This task pull all the artifacts which have been created or modified after the changeDate and create the outputFile. Parameter changeDate can have date with/without time. When time is not mentioned, it assumes it as 23:59.

retrievepackage Task

This task is provided by salesforce. Please take a look here for the details

deploypackage Task

This task is also provided by salesforce. Please take a look here for the details.

Recommendations

Avoid using special characters and spaces in the names of artifacts like email templates and layouts. ANT tries to encode and decode those special characters but fails.

ANT retrieve task retrieves profiles with only the permissions for the objects/artifacts which are part of the package, which means it will not pull the permissions which are not relevant or are not modified, so you do not need to manually set permissions after the deployment. Profiles are perfect to move using ANT.

If you have created a new profile out of an existing one, DONT create it using ANT, instead create it manually and then update using ANT otherwise profile will not have those permissions which were added/modified after you forked it.

Take a look at package.xml file after you execute packagegenerator task and remove all irrelevant artifacts which can appear due to other developers working on the same box or testing artifacts. Keep the list which is relevant to your stuff.

Have fun and let me know if you find any problems with the packagegenerator. Feel free to clone and modify it.",https://medium.com/@msabiransari/salesforce-deployment-e79cc502a952,['Muhammad Sabir'],2015-05-20 17:18:29.193000+00:00,"['Technology', 'Salesforce', 'CRM']"
Edinburgh Silver and the Goblet of TarnishHow to Clean Your Silver,"Greetings from Edinburgh Silver.

Do any of you already own some silver but you have no idea how to clean it and keep it looking brand new? Well, we guarantee that taking the little time to clean it could not be easier.

As you can see this goblet is extremely tarnished because it was left for nearly half a decade in a kitchen without being cleaned or taken care of. If you’re thinking cleaning this goblet below would be a nightmare then think again!

Just look at the results our steps to cleaning silver can bring you. Cleaning this goblet took around 3–4 minutes and the results we got were truly stunning.

Follow our few, simple steps below and your silver items will seriously look like it’s gone from looking 200 years old and ready for the dump to looking like it’s been cleaned and polished yesterday by a silversmith himself.

Firstly, just rinse the particular silver item off with water. Then we apply Anti-Tarnish Silver Soap from Town Talk Polish Co. Ltd (shown below) generously to the silver with a sponge applicator.

Once you’ve done that, rub the silver soap into the item with the sponge applicator and continuously do this until the tarnish is gone. Then rinse the soap off the item.

If you rinse all the soap off and still find the item has some tarnishing left then very simply repeat the steps above!

Here are some before and after pictures of when we cleaned our Goblet of Tarnish! It just shows you what a difference a few minutes can make.

That is really how easy it is. No trouble and no wasted time.

Also, we must add that if you want to put an extra shine to your silver items then make sure you buff it with a lint-free cloth! The cloth can also be used to remove finger marks rather than having to clean it all over again.

We really cannot stress to you how easy cleaning your silver is.

We really think that it is fun and rewarding to clean your silver up because it’s magical to see the difference between tarnished silver and newly cleaned silver.

That’s everything you need to know about cleaning and taking care of your silver and we really hope that it has helped you out.

Speak to you all soon!

The Turning Point,"The Turning Point

It all started with a simple observation…

It was January 2010. I was visiting my grandparents in South Florida. I watched my grandmother (mi abuela) sitting at the kitchen table hovered over her checkbook to balance the checking account (she would have made an excellent accountant). Suddenly the flood of stories from her past came into my mind. The struggles my grandparents went through coming to the US from Cuba in 1962. The family that had been thrown into Cuban prisons for voicing their political beliefs. The family members they had to leave behind in Cuba. The sacrifices to start over in a new country with no money, no knowledge of the language, no jobs lined up. They found work in the US that was humbling to their great abilities and slowly worked their way back to what they had before. I distinctly remember my grandmother telling me how they had paid off $55,000 of their mortgage in one year.

And here I was in my early 30s with nothing to show for financially. I had squandered away my 20s living the high life with no excuses and no reason to be in that position. I knew in that moment that I couldn’t waste the opportunity my grandparents had risked and worked so hard to give me. It would have been a slap in the face to all they had endured. It was time to draw the line in the sand and decide if I was going to continue down the path I was heading or to make a change.

When I got home I totaled all of my debt — $56,000 in student loans, car loans, and credit cards. The total took my breath away. I knew I had debt but not this much. How in the world was I ever going to be able to attack this?? It seemed insurmountable — I felt defeated already. I knew that if I wanted to get ahead financially, I needed to figure out a way to break free from the chains of debt so I could use my income for more productive and fulfilling uses — like investing for my future and being able to give to those in need.

After returning home to Minnesota, I had a conversation with my best friend Angie about my financial awakening. It just so happened that she and her husband Dave had started a personal finance class at their church called Financial Peace University (FPU) created by Dave Ramsey. Angie talked about how much she was enjoying the class and that she and Dave were already starting to see progress in a short time. I decided to look into FPU and see what this Dave Ramsey guy was all about.

Little did I know how drastically my life was about to change.

Next: The long and winding journey to paying off debt and the much anticipated day of freedom… c��< FZ",https://medium.com/@JessGarbarino/the-turning-point-622e7af4f889,['Jessica Garbarino'],2015-10-18 19:42:47.527000+00:00,"['Personal Finance', 'Debt', 'Cuba']"
Holding out for a hero: Marvel and the need for superheroines,"This is the time of the geek and the big screen superhero — but where are the superheroines? By Georgina Kiely

Bring it on: Black Widow is just one of the many female superheroes ready to take centre stage. Photo: marvelousRoland/Flickr.

It’s a fact that universally acknowledged that we’re not exactly short of superheroines who are ripe for their silver screen debut. The potential candidates are endless: Silver Sable, Thundra, Jean Grey, take your pick!

Personally, I’d kill to see a Black Widow spin-off; Scarlett Johansson is certainly a big enough name for her own franchise and who doesn’t want to watch a film starring a kickass Russian assassin who could no doubt kill a man with her pinky alone? With so many examples of superheriones crying out for their time in the spotlight, it’s baffling to wonder why the idea hasn’t been picked up yet.

I have no problems admitting to being a geek — this is our time. The rise of the geeks has been rapid and all-encompassing, and Marvel has seized the imaginations of our generation. We’re living through a superhero boom and with writers like Joss Whedon at the helm, you’d think we couldn’t go far wrong.

However, Whedon is often asked in interviews why he often chooses to focus on strong female lead characters and his ultimate answer is “because you are still asking me the question.” Indeed, there is a noticeable lack of focus on our well-loved superheroines in many of Marvel and DC adaptations, and it’s about time someone poked them into producing something the fans are desperate to see: a female lead.

The Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has skirted around the issue, saying “I think it comes down to timing”. But when could there be a better time? Even Scarlett Johansson herself has expressed a keen interest in taking on a Black Widow movie, so what exactly is holding Marvel back?

It’s certainly not that audiences wouldn’t be ready for a female lead; we’ve already seen a talking racoon and a character who can only state his own name hold their own. Feige has said that he recognises the need for a female-led franchise, so the bluster leaves me with some niggling doubts about whether timing is really the issue.

Counterintuitively, the superhero fanbase, for all the futuristic movies and out-of-this-world characters, seem to be fairly stuck in their ways. When Marvel announced there would be a female Thor and that the new Captain America would be black, the twitterverse was, in the most part, excited.

However, there were ugly comments comments — such as ‘I’m done Marvel’ or the well-considered ‘remember when #Marvel wasn’t run by a pack of political correct gelded men #goodtimes’. Thanks for sharing, guys. Here’s a tip, if you’re itching to start a comment with ‘I’m not a racist/sexist but…’ then you’re probably better off just going home and considering your life choices.

What makes this announcement of a new incarnation of the god of thunder even more exciting is that this isn’t she-Thor, Lady Thor or Thorina, this is actually Thor, a superhero in her own right with all the clout of the character behind her. Could it be the potential backlash from a minority group of Marvel-ites that’s slowing the process?

It’s possible, but the picture is not entirely tarnished with testosterone. The much anticipated Ms Marvel will soon be making an appearance in Avengers 2: Age Of Ultron — a definite step forward in the rise of the on-screen superwoman.

However, it’s important to highlight that if Marvel isn’t quick enough to decide whether they can take the time to produce something the fans are pleading for, inevitably someone else will get there first. Female superheroes may be getting their time to shine sooner than we think.

Sony Pictures have hinted at a fresh new look at the Spidey universe, with a female-led picture set to be released in 2017. Even sooner, Warner Bros. seem to have beaten them to the punch with pictures of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman in the 2016 production Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice.

These female superhero spin offs may be just what we need to re-vamp any remaining washed out clichés, so who’s going to get there first?

Points to Consider before Selecting a Florist for Wedding Party Flower,"Points to Consider before Selecting a Florist for Wedding Party Flower

Florists do have much more tasks than just providing attractive designs of bouquets for different occasions. They coordinate very carefully with the bride and groom with an objective to understand their thoughts and feelings, and consequently create a harmonious appearance for their wedding ceremony. In addition, they do create centerpieces and other table decorations so as to make their party display their feelings with increased elegance.

Your wedding party can turn into an attention-grabbing event; provided you have selected a right florist in NYC. Here are some important points that you should consider before you select a particular floral designer. Before going through the suggested points, let’s have a look at the questions that you should ask your floral designer:

How do you select customized trends and designs for a particular floral arrangement?

How many days do you take to complete it?

Do you have any method to mix the colors for creating a soothing atmosphere?

After asking the three questions mentioned above, you should sit with your select floral designer and consider some important points. The points are as below:

About flowers:

Flowers are the core attractions for a floral arrangement. If selected properly, you can create a pleasing mood in your wedding party by selecting your preferred type of flowers. There are some types of organic, pesticide-free, and sustainably grown varieties of party flowers in NYC, which you can select for your party.

About the cost:

Secondly, you should consider about the cost that you are probably going to pay for. You should discuss with your floral designer if he/she is delivering the flowers for free. Some of the service providers are trying their best to allure the audiences by offering free delivery so as to lower the inherent cost as far as possible.

Delivery procedure:

For a better and more beautiful floral design, you need to have your flowers delivered quickly without any damage. Ask your florists if they have a reliable procedure for flower delivery in New York City.

So, it is not challenging to find a right and reliable floral designer in NYC; provided you have checked all the key aspects carefully. You should consider the points mentioned above before you plan to select a particular type of floral arrangement for your wedding ceremony.

In New York City, you have a great chance to find your preferred floral arrangement. But you should be aware of all the important aspects first of all.",https://medium.com/@interiorfoliage/points-to-consider-before-selecting-a-florist-for-wedding-party-flower-a56cbe70853b,['Interior Foliage'],2015-12-30 11:40:20.237000+00:00,"['Flowers', 'Weddings']"
Shot! Fifteen out of 15: Floral,"When you take as many photos as I do, the ones that tend to stand out are those that have something a little different about them, those that for some reason or another are out of the ordinary.

Usually, one sees a photo in isolation, left to judge it only by what information is contained within the frame. But photos are more than just a moment in time. In most cases the end result is governed by the circumstances presented to the photographer, meaning there’s often an untold story behind them, one that can make them even more interesting than just being another nice picture.

Choosing just fifteen from each of my key subject areas was never going to be easy and some personal favourites never made the cut.

Shooting flowers and gardens is of course something a lot of photographers do, some even do nothing else. But getting really interesting shots takes more than just pointing your camera at a beautiful flower or a nice garden. Anyone can do that. Especially if they’re at a world-class flower show like Chelsea or Hampton Court.

To do it well, you need to cultivate an ability to seek out only those that are a cut above and then figure out the best way to shoot them. As well as getting your angles right, the elements play a big part. The sun and the wind can all help make the difference between a beautiful image and a common or garden snap.

These then are the stories behind fifteen of my favourite floral images from 2015.

Spray! You don’t have to go to prestigious flower shows to get great floral shots. This stunning spray of tulips was actually taken outside a florists, The Flower Stand in Hove.

Time For Tea 1: For the last four years, one of the most interesting exhibits to shoot at the Chelsea Flower Show has been created by Interflora. Whilst they’ve never managed to deliver anything quite as brilliant as their 2011 Perspectives installation, their floral arrangements are amongst the best you’ll see at the show. As it’s impossible to get good shots of the installation in its entirety, I’ve always focused on the details of the display. This year’s Time For Tea was no different. By being creative with my angles, and isolating small sections, I came away with a range of very contemporary images.

Time For Tea 2: Another image from Interflora’s Chelsea display which always features unusual combinations of flowers in wonderful colours, artistically arranged against a clean white backdrop. I’m not interested in capturing the entirety, for me it’s all about isolating the details. All too often, the individual parts on their own make better photographs than what they are a part of.

The Telegraph Garden: My favourite show garden at this year’s Chelsea was designed by Marcus Barnett and inspired by the strong linear geometry of the De Stijl movement and especially of Dutch artist Piet Mondrian. Bercause of their size, show gardens are difficult to capture in a single photograph, but this shot gives a pretty good impression of why this one won a Gold medal. Although why there wasn’t also a red and yellow cushion will always baffle me!

Sweet Surprise: At Chelsea, the RHS announce their plant of the year. Often, the winner underwhelms in terms of visual impact and more interesting examples appear amongst the nineteen runners-up. This year was no different, as this pink gerbera was hands down the best looking. Photographing it however was a real challenge, the plant wasn’t that big, the queues to see it were and I was shooting handheld, with the EM1’s in-camera macro. I have to confess, it looks a lot better here, than it does in reality. They say the camera never lies, but the reality is most images are just a tad economical with the truth!

In The Pink: Tulips have always been one of my favourite flowers to photograph and Bloms Blooms always have the best display of tulips at Chelsea. The Blom family should know what they’re doing, they’ve been breeding tulips since 1860! Getting good shots of them isn’t easy as you can’t go onto the stand and the lighting in the Great Pavilion is terrible. These were shot from above. The end result looks like they’ve beeen painted, rather than photographed.

A Trugmaker’s Garden: A trug is a traditional wooden basket used in gardening. Dating back to the 1820’s, they are still made in Sussex by a handful of craftsmen using willow and sweet chestnut. At this year’s Chelsea, trugs were celebrated with an artisan garden. It won a gold medal for Chelsea first-timers Serena Fremantle and Tina Vallis. This pastoral image is just a small detail from their gorgeous recreation of a trugmaker’s garden.

World Vision: So many show gardens at Chelsea and Hampton Court aim to tell a heartfelt story, often one related to some kind of charity or cause. This one by John Warland was no different, but to be honest it was the media, more than the message, that interested me. Floating in an ink black reflective pool were groups of cacti set in mirrored squares. It was as surreal as it was mesmerising. And, when you get your angles right, it made for a memorable image.

Spirit of the Aegean: Another geometric image, this time from Hampton Court. It’s a detail from Esra Parr’s gold-winning show garden for Noble Caledonia. There’s something creatively satisfying in finding a standalone image within a far larger garden. Once you’ve identified an interesting feature, it’s then all about working out how to shoot it in the most interesting way. Apart from the angles, I really like the reflection of the lavender in the rill.

The Camomile Lawn: I really liked Sarah Keyser’s first ever show garden, particularly her all white planting, set against white-painted timber. The curved lawn was camomile, rather than grass. The curve is what makes the image.

Sempervivum: Continuing the curved theme, this image is a detail of a pot on Rae Wilkinson’s Healing Urban Garden. Sempervivum is a succulent found in the mountainous regions of Southern Europe and on Mediterranean islands. The name translates as “always living” or the common name of live forever.

The Serenity Stone: A small detail from the Healing Urban Garden, designed by West Sussex garden designer Rae Wilkinson. Often, show gardens are filled with loads of different planting and a multitude of features, what works better in a single image is to isolate just a few of them: in this case, the mauve flowers, the grasses and the roundstone. How one frames those elements is what makes the picture.

Viridis: Coastal planting on Littlehampton’s newly-built riverside walkway. Despite some of the flowers having gone over, this one’s all about the colours and tones. What makes it though is the metal background. What happens in the background is as important as the subject.

Glorious Carnations: Just a few of the 35,000 red carnations (yes, 35,000 individual carnations!) that featured on the Qatar Flower Wall at this year’s Glorious Goodwood. Thousands photographed it, but I doubt any shot it like this.

Eryngium: Sea holly taken on Littlehampton’s riverside walkway. Another of my favourite plants to photograph. This would make a great album cover!

Behind the image: All these images were shot handheld with the Olympus OM-D E-M1 and either the 12–40 2.8 Pro or the 75 1.8 lens, often using the camera’s built-in macro function and always with available light only.

Amaryllis: To Be or Not to Be,"Amaryllis: To Be or Not to Be

You’ve probably seen these plants before, but do you know what they’re really called?

Amaryllis is the name of a plant genus

these flowers grow from bulbs and are most often bought and sold during the winter months

I would wager that you know at least one person with an Amaryllis in their home right now

but I would also wager that you don’t

because what we commonly refer to as Amaryllis is not Amaryllis at all

these lovely green shooted, trumpet flowered organisms are actually members of the genus Hippeastrum

the florists are lying to you!

well, not actually

what they’re really doing is continuing a long held contention over the difficult process of defining nomenclature

for years there was confusion among botanists over the difference between these two genera which is why theAmaryllis is still used as the common name

if you go to a florist, or a green house, or a grocery store, you will surely find Hippeastrum labeled as Amaryllis

Wild Amaryllis

actual Amaryllis are native to the Western Cape region of South Africa and are not sold in pots in grocery stores

they thrive in mountainous areas and usually grow and flower after the first winter rains

they also prosper in urban and suburban plantings on the West Coast of the US

California is full of them since the environment there closely mimics that of the Amaryillys’ natural habitat

Australia has also taken a liking to the wild ones

they have created all sorts of cross breeds and hybrids between species so as to obtain different color variations

it’s easy to tell a hybrid from a purebred since the hybrids usually have striped, dark veined petals

But what isn’t so easy is determining what’s actually Amaryillis and what’s Hippeastrum. Just remember that if you’re not outside and you’re not in South Africa, it’s probably Hippeastrum, no matter what the tag from the plant nursery may say. But if you’re looking at a bulb in a pot, it’s probably Hippeastrum. This nomenclature confusion is just a taste of the confusion that comes along with taxonomy. The naming of things in our natural world is a beautiful process, no doubt, but we often run into issues caused by long held contentions that cause problems, both for botanists and every day plant enthusiasts. This difficulty is exactly why we must carry on with this exercise in naming our Earth’s inhabitants. Messy and discombobulating as it may be, the fruits of discovery and organization are well worth the struggle.",https://medium.com/think-with-me/amaryllis-to-be-or-not-to-be-ac11766cdebb,['Isabella Armour'],2015-12-28 15:54:36.485000+00:00,"['Science', 'Environment', 'Flowers']"

If DIGITAL MARKETING is absent?

· If a company don’t have digital marketing strategy then it would became directionless because they don’t have clear strategic goals for what they want in terms of new customers or building deeper relationships with existing ones. And if you don’t put resources, you don’t evaluate your outcomes.

· If your store or trade is not online then your services may be underestimated. Different customers have different dynamics to traditional channels.

Just for 🌱⭕️🐋.

The new Emojis just came out yesterday, and now making messages with them is more fun - because it is more readable. The taco makes a nice D, for instance. I took the time to compile the entire list in a line-by-line alphabet below, and to give some pointers on how to use these for the best effect.

Instructions for easy emoji messages

Copy this entire post with all the alphabet-like characters below Paste into a full emoji-compatible text editor app on iOS 9.1 or OSX El Capitan, which just arrived yesterday, 10–21–15. (not sure about Android yet) Save it where you can access easily. Open the file for composing a new message. Copy each “letter” and paste them at the bottom of your emoji file to create a fun new message. Every emoji has space before and after so a double click or double tap will select it easily. When you’re finished, copy the new emojibet message and paste it into a text or email. You can save completed messages in your file for additional uses too. I put mine in a Pages/Word document with 2 collumns and single spaced. That way I can see all the emojis in a group at the top and still have room to compose without scrolling. Just double click — copy — paste to create a list of phrases that begins just underneath the alphabet. As I add phrases, they stack up with the most recent at the top. It’s pretty fast and easy, all things considered.

Readability

Be sure to use the more recognizable characters often, or it becomes to hard to understand. An odd emoji that barely looks like a letter will work if it has a strong letter-like emoji on both sides of it. The context is important. Try a few different things until it reads well, and uses a variety of images. A new line for each word also creates readability, because the emojis have unpredictable spaces.

The messages aren’t as easy to read over the shoulder, so not only is it fun, it can keep a special message a little more private.

Conversational UIs & How They Change Brand Exposure

Cortana, Microsoft’s voice interface, takes her name from an AI character in the Halo videogames

There’s a popular trend in user interfaces, one which some companies are spending billions of dollars building, and some are leveraging to minimize their costs. It’s intuitive and anticipatory, hiding a mess of search results behind a single blessed response. But every product or service has an interface, and behind that interface is code that defines how the interface responds to user input. Except, in this case, sometimes it’s humans behind the interface. For now.

Conversational UIs just make sense: why learn to navigate a website or an app when you can just ask for what you want? Whether you’re talking to Siri or Alexa, cc’ing Amy, texting Stefan, or messaging M, isn’t it easier to just ask for what you want? Having computers understand us on our terms, instead of us confroming to theirs, has been a holy grail of computing since the beginning, and in the next few years the tide will finally shift to the former. It encompasses everything from the voice-powered interfaces from Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, to Facebook’s text-based M, Slack’s automated bots, and a myriad of startups, including SoundHound, Pana, Magic, x.ai, even Invisible Girlfriend/Boyfriend.

At the IPG Media Lab, we think of conversational UIs as anything that lets you input natural language, regardless of whether that interface uses voice or text, and regardless of whether that text arrives via SMS, messenger service, or email. (I’m still waiting for handwritten input via post, but it’s early days.) On the backend, it can be powered by software, humans, or some blend of both. To the user, it looks like AI either way, but the smart use of humans can often make services more responsive than what can be achieved with AI alone. For example, Facebook’s M will respond to any request, no matter how obscure, giving it a lot more breadth than Siri or Google Now can manage with pure software.

In the short term, using humans to fill in the gaps is a smart way to offer a full-service app. And just as Uber will eventually replace its drivers with autonomous cars, it’s easy to see how Facebook will automate away the most popular queries of M, sending only the most fringe requests to humans to parse. Similarly, it’s easy to see services which are text-based today adding a voice option, or vice-versa. Just as young children today think that screens they can’t touch are broken, so, too, will the children of 2020, about objects they can’t talk to.

There are many reasons why conversational UIs are exploding in popularity right now, but an important factor is our burgeoning IoT, and the post-app interfaces that they require. Websites were convenient ways to get information to users, and apps are perfect interfaces for many services. But we’re beginning to witness the unbundling of apps into their component pieces, which will allow the system to reach in and retrieve the pieces it needs. And the result of that indexing allows the same services to become available via new form factors, sometimes without screens or keyboards.

Conversational UIs present a fundamental shift in how brands relate to their existing customers, and how they find new customers. Facebook is pitching Messenger as a key customer service platform, and it would be a boon to consumers to see brands embrace it. But whether it’s texted or spoken, your brand will quite literally have a voice, powered by some combination of humans and software. It’s time to start thinking about how funny, flirty, or sarcastic you want that voice to be. When confused, Siri makes jokes, Google remains silent, and M summons a human. How will your brand react?

Alexa, currently embodied in Amazon’s Echo, and Pana, the text-based travel agent, offer a glimpse at what brand integration into third party platforms may look like. Rather than Amazon’s exhaustive catalog, if you search for a product to buy, Alexa only offers up previous purchases, encouraging brand loyalty in the name of simplicity. And Pana only offers one option for a flight or hotel at a time, hand-curated by a human. If a search resulted only in one response, how would your brand respond? You could buy your way into being the default response, for a hefty sum, if available. Or you could ramp up brand advertising, so a user asks for you by name. Would you try to influence the curators, as well? Should you?",https://medium.com/@adamjsimon/alexa-tell-me-a-story-about-the-future-72b913a7ce74,['Adam Simon'],2015-10-15 15:01:54.491000+00:00,"['Messaging', 'Advertising', 'Conversational UI']"
My theory on the future of customer service,"My theory on the future of customer service

But, first let's talk about messaging apps. Messaging apps are everywhere. They help you settle a dispute with your cable operator, they’ll pick up flowers for your significant other and they’ll book a nanny for your night out. They’re great and they’ll only get better. But messaging isn’t the reason to be excited about these new technologies. It’s that they’ll fit into the frictions of everyday life and allow for new consumer experiences that aren’t easily available or efficient with the current web — traditional or mobile. Messaging isn’t the innovation, but the layer that new, but distinctly similar businesses will be built on.

This brings me to future of customer service.

Messaging will be involved be involved, but only as the foundational layer.

It will introduce the next evolution of the CRM as true relationship management and nurturing.

It will start small and niche like all great technology does.

It will allow businesses to service consumers wherever they are, across platforms, apps and the web.

It will leverage AI for most use cases, but the human touch will be necessary for complex interactions that require nuance and empathy.

Netty at Layer: Powering Client API,"Netty at Layer: Powering Client API

Modern communication platforms deal with an ever growing number of protocols. In order to keep pace, network technology stacks must be built to remain flexible and extensible.

To achieve this flexibility, companies such as Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and others, turn to Netty, an open source Java NIO framework that enables the development of high performing protocol servers and clients. Netty has also found a home here at Layer, where it helps us handle the flow of millions of messages every day through our Client API.

What Netty brings us

Layer is a distributed system with highly dependent services, where each one may spend significant time waiting for responses from other dependent upstream services. A non-blocking, event-driven I/O library like Netty allows these services to concurrently process requests, while taking full advantage of our server hardware.

Netty is also protocol agnostic, and adding a new protocol to Netty is as simple as creating the appropriate event handlers. This extensibility has led to many community-driven protocol implementations including HTTP/2, WebSockets, SPDY, and MQTT [1].

Additionally Netty provides:

A unified API with which to build network services

A powerful threading model

Reduced resource consumption and zero copy support

A vibrant community and wide industry adoption

All in all it’s an excellent framework on which to base our stack.

Integrating Netty into Layer’s Client API

Client API Architecture.

Entry server

Layer’s entry server is built atop Netty to make use of performance goodies and HTTP/2.

Our HTTP/1.1 pipeline contains handlers for SslHandler (TLS support to Connection), HTTP codecs (Encoder and Decoder), HTTP message aggregation (HTTP Object Aggregator), CORS handler, and app specific handlers such as nonces, sessions, WebSocketServerHandler, etc.

We’ve adopted best practices from the community [2] such as:

OpenSSL based SslEngine to speed-up connections.

epoll based native socket transport in Linux (for higher performance and produces less garbage)

PooledByteBufAllocator (to reduce allocation/deallocation time)

Shared stateless channel handler across channels to reduce GC (nonce and session handlers are stateless and both are annotated as @ChannelHandler.Shareable)

The system’s NoncesHandler uses Memcache to cache nonces for identity-token validation and session creation.

REST API and WebSockets

Additionally we take advantage of Netty’s RFC 6455 compliant WebSocket support to expose a REST API and bi-directional WebSockets for real-time notifications.

Each REST API request comes with the Authorization header containing a session-token. The entry server caches this session-token in read-through SessionCache (a cache miss will trigger an event to fetch session info from Authentication service), and each session-token is then validated and authenticated to process the request (see our Client API documentation for more details on authentication challenges).

API requests for conversations and messages are passed through to a user recon engine — a process in which a user’s conversations and messages are reconciled into a given state (such as deleted, updated, seen, etc.).

The WebSocket API allows a client to send requests to the server. Each WebSocket upgrade request comes with a session-token for authentication and sub-protocol negotiation for the connection handshake. Upon successful WebSocket upgrade, the WebSocket connection is added in WebSocketConnectionManager’s DefaultChannelGroup. Each WebSocket connection is identified with a session-token and connection-id.

Request/Response/Change/Signal packets are wrapped as TextWebSocketFrame. Request packets are decoded as String and routed to a given user recon engine through the ‘in’ exchange/queue in RabbitMQ server. Consumer of the ‘in’ exchange/queue in a user recon engine will consume the request (message) and process the request (with the help of invoking HTTP requests to messaging fabric and DB inserts/updates etc)

A user recon engine can emit the response/changes to the ‘out’ exchange/queue in RabbitMQ server. Consumer of the ‘out’ exchange/queue in the entry server will consume the response/changes, meaning message headers shall contain session-token and connection-id to look up the WebSocket connection from WebSocketConnectionManager and then notification (response) will be pushed to that connection using the Netty Channel’s writeAndFlush.

Customer use cases

Bidirectional WebSocket for a typing indicator : Clients can send a typing indicator using WebSocket to indicate that the user is currently writing a message in a conversation. This can be sent on every key press in the input and will send a user_typing ephemeral event to all the participants in a conversation.

Bidirectional WebSocket for desktop applications with real-time collaboration such as gaming, trading, chat, etc

Sample code can be found in our Layer for Web github repo.

Not all SMS are created equal: exploring the murky waters of grey routes,"Not all SMS are created equal: exploring the murky waters of grey routes

With more than 20 billion SMS messages sent every day, SMS has become a primary form of communication for most consumers. It’s also a vital tool for enterprises to engage with their customers and other key stakeholders on mobile. But, there’s a dark side to the humble text message, which has serious consequences for enterprises looking for a cheap deal to send SMS to customers and stakeholders.

Not all SMS are created equal!

The journey an SMS takes from sender to recipient can vary greatly, depending on the origin of the message and the mobile operators involved. An SMS travelling between two licensed and established mobile operators is smooth and very quick — this is what’s known as a white route. But not all operators and countries across the world have the same standards and regulations when it comes to telecommunications, it is possible to route a message through different countries and less scrupulous operators and platforms to save money. This is what is known as a grey route.

Using a grey route is the equivalent of taking a bus from London to Beijing. Yes it’s cheaper than flying and you’ll probably get to your destination eventually, but you’ll be exhausted, disorientated and a bit smelly when you arrive. Grey routes often involve the use of a service or platform that is legal in one country, but not always both countries of the sender and receiver. While grey routes are technically legal, they are far from legitimate and cost the telecommunications industry billions. They also have many risks attached.

Security and accountability

With white routes you get complete transparency, you know the exact routes your messages take and you get accurate delivery and read receipts. With grey routes, you can never actually be sure of the journey your messages take when sent, and when they have been received. Worse still, delivery receipts and read receipts are often falsified along the journey.

And more importantly, you can’t guarantee your customers’ details will remain secure as your messages are passed through a series of less reputable platforms. Being held responsible for a data leak can be catastrophic for your organisation’s reputation and has been the undoing of many established brands.

Poor performance

Because your messages are routed through less established platforms across the world, grey routes do not offer the reliability and security of white routes. It takes time to route the messages through other platforms, so your messages are often delayed or, worst still, never reach their destination. One of the advantages of SMS is that you can reach your consumers at precise times that will create the most impact, grey routes severely reduce your ability to do this.

Bad user experience

Again, as a consequence of being routed across various less established platforms, your message can be altered or corrupted, such as broken text and hyperlinks or the sender ID is replaced with an international number — which damages the credibility of your message.

A delayed delivery also creates a poor user experience and could damage your organisation’s brand. Imagine you’re sending out an offer to your customers that expires within a short time. If your customer doesn’t receive this offer in time, or the offer has expired by the time it’s received, they will not be pleased with your service.

Does mGage use grey routes?

Because not all SMS are created equal, the ‘buyer beware principle’ definitely applies to using grey routes. mGage will always use white routes between licensed and reputable operators across the world. We place a higher importance on effective communication, quality and protecting your organisation’s reputation, rather than just offering the cheapest price.",https://medium.com/@ageitos/not-all-sms-are-created-equal-exploring-the-murky-waters-of-grey-routes-fb7802b51205,['Juan Ageitos'],2015-10-17 09:58:35.054000+00:00,"['Messaging', 'Sms']"
WeChat (微信) for Beginners: Introduction,"WeChat is the window into China everything.

It’s a way for you to connect with friends, do business, and reach millions and millions of people. In a few short years, WeChat has grown from nothing into a messaging and marketing giant. Mobile China = WeChat.

WeChat is owned by Tencent (founders of QQ, another popular messaging app) and by the numbers, is one of the largest social networking apps in the world. As of August 12, 2015 WeChat has 600 million monthly active users (MAUs). Twice the population of the United States.

WeChat is a messaging service with an explosion of features on it’s mobile-only platform. Connie Chan from Andreessen Horowitz took a deep dive into WeChat’s history and future. Highly suggested for an in-depth review of WeChat’s business fundamentals.

I want to introduce WeChat basics so marketers and normal people like you and I can better operate in China. I’ll cover:

Why WeChat is important

How to set up the English version

Find and add friends

Feature introduction

In the meantime, I encourage everybody to download the app and I can be your first friend (id: bampbell).

WeChat can be downloaded from the app store either in English or Chinese depending on your phones default language. It’s best if you use a Chinese cell phone number to register, it will open up a lot of features but a US number works as well.

Why it’s important you start using WeChat

China is a massive market everybody is trying to figure out and get a piece of (myself included). WeChat is a perfect gateway drug to getting your feet wet with a built-in translate feature for non-mandarin speakers so you can begin to build a network.

WeChat serves a lot of different purposes for different people. Personally I have two accounts: one for business and one for pleasure. Here is some areas of your life it will improve.

Social Life

You’re entire social life will be run through WeChat. Guaranteed. People prefer to use WeChat over phone calls…yikes.

Business

Business executives, managers, employees, and businesses themselves all have WeChat accounts and use them daily. China never caught the email bug and have always preferred instant messaging. We now are seeing a transition from QQ (basically IM) to mobile messaging aka WeChat.

WeChat makes it easy to set up call times in different timezones and stay in touch with what’s happening in your business on the ground through images/videos. It has been the silver bullet on our nursery business.

Marketing

WeChat uses the ‘app within an app’ model and already hosts millions of mini apps on its platform (See Connie Chan’s article above). Marketers can target ming boggling numbers of active Chinese users through ‘official accounts’. This is important because Chinese consumers are notoriously difficult to reach and WeChat is a perfect platform to reach your target.

How to find/invite friends

There are a lot of different ways to add people on WeChat. Below are the most common. WeChat follows the Facebook model of adding/accepting friends rather than an open platform like Twitter.

User ID (usually their Chinese cell) — used unless you’re standing next to somebody

QR code — fastest and most used method of adding people on WeChat face to face

Other — there are other ways like shake or recommended friends but these are the ones you’ll use most

Accepting friend requests — Once somebody has added you, it will pop up under recommended friends

Features

WeChat is loaded with features and continues to expand focused on utility rather than fluff. I still remember when it was an ugly black/white screen you could send messages over wifi.

Messaging

Messaging is the core of WeChat and it’s main interface. You can send text, images, videos, files of all formats (.pdf, word, excel), voice recordings, stickers, and short 5 second videos.

You communicate directly with friends, not with strangers. It’s similar to Facebook but focused on the messaging rather than the ‘wall post’ model. Facebook went from wall -> messages, WeChat has grew from messenger -> wall (aka moments). Far more utilitarian.

Voice messages

Users are able to walkie talkie into WeChat and leave a voice message (max 60 seconds). What’s culturally interesting about voice recordings are they avoid one of the most annoying parts of Mandarin Chinese: typing characters. Unbelievably more efficient.

Autotranslate (yay!)

WeChat translates messages directly in app by pressing and holding messages. If your default language is English, it will automatically translate into Chinese and vice versa for Chinese <> English. Amazing feature for people living in China that don’t speak Mandarin.

Send images/video

WeChat automatically compresses images/videos and you can send up to 9 images at a time — either by taking them new or selecting them from an album.

Sights

Record and send 6 second clips either directly to other users via messenger or in the moments feature. Think Vine but built in.

Voice/video calls

Voice and video calls are embedded into the messaging feature. Voice/video calls are made natively through WeChat and can only be made through the platform (for now) and seems to be faster than Skype.

Group messaging

Pretty self explanatory. You can create a group and take advantage of all messaging features.

Group messaging alone is a gigantic time saver. One message can prevent an entire 30 minute meeting with our staff.

Moments

Moments deserves it’s own post. Imagine Facebook as a mobile only version of News Feed. You post articles, pictures, sights, or just their thoughts.

For each post you can either ‘like’ it or ‘leave a comment’. If I comment on a post, if we’re not mutual friends, the third party won’t see my post. This is another level of privacy for users posting personal content to their WeChat.

Another useful feature is you can highly target your readers by selecting who to send content to. This is awesome for marketers who want to send more directed adds at their audiences.

Can’t tell you how many people use this. Everywhere you look, they are spending the majority of their time on moments. I’ll be experimenting with ways to better target readers.

Payments

One of the strongest features of WeChat is it’s payment system. It allows payments to be paid directly through the platform itself and businesses can accept payment instantaneously. Through the payments platform you can: book a hotel, taxi, doctors appointment etc.

Payments bring the most important factors to business natively inside of the app: money. Through official accounts, businesses can reach users directly and in a more intimate way.

Note: this requires that you have Chinese cell phone number to sign up. I’ll think of a workaround method to hacking this so people can gain access to this feature.

I owe my social life and business to WeChat while living in China. It has served as an invaluable tool and I’m sure will continue to only get better. Moving forward, I can’t wait to see just how deep it can infiltrate everybody's lives.",https://medium.com/on-china/wechat-%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1-for-beginners-introduction-335a88034e44,['Charlie Campbell'],2015-10-23 13:47:18.303000+00:00,"['Messaging', 'Wechat', 'Mobile']"
Move Fast and Build Messenger,"Being big isn’t slowing down Facebook. The speed at which it is innovating right now is remarkable. Its army of highly talented, hyper-focused developers is evident as ever.

There are many examples — Instant Articles, notifications feed, virtual reality, all things Instagram — but nothing stands out more than Messenger. Its speed, gif integration, social graph, and money transfers have quickly turned it into the best messaging app on any phone outside of China. As a result, Messenger now has 700 million monthly active users, with 500 million coming in the last year.

Everyday, it seems there is an amazing new invention inside Messenger. Last night, I subscribed to the World Series and got real time updates, commentary, photos and video from the game. As a New Yorker who thinks baseball is a wee bit (very) slow but wanted to keep up with the local story, it was a nice way to watch the game. It’s Sports Center in real time.

There was no big, splashy announcement about this feature. Facebook is heads down, building and shipping cool shit for Messenger.

And nothing is cooler than M, the virtual personal assistant inside of Messenger that does whatever you ask of it, including booking airplane tickets and reducing the cost of your cable bill. If the app works at scale as magically as it has for the people using it in Beta, Messenger will likely become Facebook’s most popular app.

Even without M, Messenger has grown into one of the biggest and most popular apps in the world. Businesses are just starting adopt it for customer service, which will only increase time spent in the app, and it sure beats email.

It’s easy to forget that last year most users and critics panned the decision to remove messaging from Facebook, pushing everyone to Messenger. It stands as a good reminder that you should always prioritize user experience and long term growth, and always defy short-sighted external voices. Another reminder: Facebook doesn’t roll out big changes without testing them across its billion-person focus group; it knows what you want better than you do.

Without question, Messenger was by inspired WeChat, the pioneer in the platformization of messaging (as I wrote last year). To its credit, Facebook evolved what it learned to align with its core values. WeChat is a lot like an operating system, with many apps operating inside of it. In Messenger, everything occurs inside a conversation, native to the messaging experience. As Messenger adds more features, this could change… or, you won’t have to click off to another part of the app to hail a cab, buy sneakers, order food, or sell a stock — M will do it for you. It’s the Facebook algorithm of messaging: you don’t have to look for what you want, we’re doing it for you.

The fast yet methodical way Facebook has turned Messenger into a cutting edge utility is innovation at its finest. It’s the blueprint of the future.

"Telegram, the superior IM platform","Telegram, the superior IM platform

Whatsapp has taken the IM world by storm, but why I don’t truly understand. It has obvious failings that even the billions of Facebook dollars can’t address.

In comes the new kid on the block, Telegram, giving you almost everything you want in an IM app.

Telegram was developed by Pavel and Nikolai Durov, 2 brothers from Russia. They set out to create a fast, free secure IM App and they succeeded.

Here is why I life it more than Whatsapp and hoping the world would adopt it as quickly as they did with Whatsapp.

Cross Platform even Desktops

Telegram is not only for smartphones and tablets, but for computers as well. That is what has drawn to this IM app.

As a mac user, I love iMessage, but it is only limited to OS X and iOS users.

Send Large Files

With Telegram you can send files of up to 2gig in size!

Independent of Mobile

You can use Telegram on your desktop even if you phone is not signed in. With Whatsapp’s pathetic web chat, your phone needs to be connect and unlocked for it to work.

It’s free

It doesn’t cost anything, again unlike Whatsapp.

Continuous development

The developers continually improves the apps both for desktop and mobile platforms.

Works on an iPad

It works on your iPad, unlike Whatsapp.

The list goes on and on.

I don’t understand the popularity of Whatsapp. For me there is no comparison.",https://medium.com/@stoffel/telegram-the-superior-im-platform-582e43f27374,[],2015-10-14 18:05:02.793000+00:00,"['Telegram', 'Messaging']"
Messaging apps: From counting users to counting bots,"Back in 2008, Nokia sold 468 million phones making the company the undisputed king of the mobile phone market with over 40% market share. This same year, Apple sold little over 10 million iPhones and launched iPhone App Store with just 500 third party apps. By the end of 2010, when Apple App Store had over 300,000 apps, it became clear to all including Nokia that the number of apps is much more important than the number of devices. Apps drive demand for phones creating network effects between users and 3rd party developers. Smartphone users attract developers. Developer create apps. Apps attract more users, which attract more developers.

A very similar dynamic begins to unfold in messaging platforms. Popular messaging apps evolve into developer-centric platforms having the same kind of network effect as iOS and Android. Soon we will compare messaging apps not by number of users, but by the number of bots/integrations available on the platform. Messaging users attract developers. Developers create bots. Bots attract more users, which attract more developers.

Messaging has emerged as a new interaction paradigm on mobile, with leading apps (Whatsapp, WeChat, Facebook Messenger, KakaoTalk, Line, Viber) amassing hundreds of millions of users. David Marcus, vice president of messaging products at Facebook says in his interview to the Wired magazine:

“The messaging era is definitely now. It’s the one thing people do more than anything else on their phone.”

So far, competition between messaging apps is based on number of users. In Q3 2015, Whatsapp (acquired by Facebook for over $19B) has 900 million monthly active users; Facebook Messenger — 700 million; and WeChat — 600 million. But now things start to change.

While Facebook leads in number of messaging users, Chinese Weixin, or as it is known in the West WeChat, is a clear leader in turning messaging into a platform.

WeChat at its core is a messaging app for sending text, voice, and photos to your friends and family, but it is also much more. Connie Chan, Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, explains on the company blog:

“Along with its basic communication features, WeChat users in China can access services to hail a taxi, order food delivery, buy movie tickets, play casual games, check in for a flight, send money to friends, access fitness tracker data, book a doctor appointment, get banking statements, pay the water bill, find geo-targeted coupons, recognize music, search for a book at the local library, meet strangers around you, follow celebrity news, read magazine articles, and even donate to charity … all in a single, integrated app.”

WeChat achieves this by supporting lightweight apps that are called “official accounts”. There are well over 10 million official accounts on the platform: from celebrities, banks, media outlets, and fashion brands to hospitals, drug stores, car manufacturers, to internet startups, personal blogs, and more. These lightweight apps are approved to access exclusive APIs for payments, location, direct messages, voice messages, user IDs, and more. Essentially, WeChat is not only messaging app, but a developer-centric platform allowing developers to add value to the service.

Facebook has no choice but to follow WeChat. Facebook’s David Marcus said at the Code/Mobile conference in October 2015:

“Messaging is really, truly the next frontier. The Asian paradigm has shown there’s a there there.”

Having introduced Messenger platform at its F8 developer conference in March 2015, Messenger has adopted the WeChat approach and will now be open to 3rd party developers to build new “tools for expression” and also let users communicate with businesses through simple conversation threads.

WeChat and Facebook are not alone in their attempts to take messaging to a new level. Telegram, which started as a more secure Whatsapp clone, evolves into something much more interesting with the announcement of their Telegram Bot Platform. The developer-centric platform allows 3rd party developers to create Bots, which are simply Telegram accounts operated by software sporting AI-like features.

The same trend shows itself even in the more conservative enterprise space with Slack Technologies Inc. having risen to $2B valuation in less than 2 years. Slack is a messaging app for teams designed to enable integration of messaging with popular enterprise apps and services. The company has 1.1 million daily active users, but also 100 integrations with 900,000 integration installs on the Slack platform.

These range from Giphy gifs to expressing feelings to co-workers; to MailChimp email marketing service; Crashlytics to monitor mobile app bugs; Trello for tracking tasks or manage help tickets from Zendesk.

The Slack Platform also supports bot users allowing companies automate many processes. A bot user is a special kind of free user account optimized for writing automated bots that connect to Slack using the Real Time Messaging API. Users can interact with bots using direct messages or even invite bots to private groups.

For example, The New York Times data science team has built a Slack bot to help decide which stories to post to social media.

The bot, called Blossom, predicts how articles or blog posts will do on social and also suggests which stories editors should promote. All within the framework of the messaging app.

Slack evolves into an enterprise developer-centric platform. There are already several startup teams experimenting with building companies on top of Slack messaging platform.

Similar to what happened in mobile platforms, the basis of competition in messaging apps changes from the number of users to the number of bots (integrations) and the messaging apps themselves evolve into developer-centric platforms.

Today Whatsapp is the largest messaging network with 900M users. It does one thing, messaging, exceptionally well. But it increasingly starts to resemble Nokia. Nokia also did one thing, mobile phones, exceptionally well, but missed the transition to developer-centric platforms, where the winners are decided by developers.

From Chicken Wings to Launch: Part 1,"25 cent chicken wings.

That’s how it all started. Every Wednesday, my friend Brian and I would go eat wings, drink beer, and chat about “guy stuff”. On a particular day about 6 months ago, we were halfway through our ritual (which was eat a round of wings, have a beer, then have another batch of wings) when we spotted two people talking at the bar.

“I wonder if he’ll get her number”, I said.

“Maybe. Most likely it’ll be a fake or something.” he replied.

So we got to thinking — what if there was a way to connect to someone without the pitfalls associated with a phone number? It’s hard to remember, easy to mis-type, and once you give it out it’s out there for good. So that clingy person you met at the bar, your crazy ex-girlfriend, or upset Craigslist buyer can do whatever they want with it. The bottom line is, we all meet people on a day-to-day basis that we may or may not want to give our personal information to. Or, we just want to talk to them temporarily.

Fast forward till now. Just yesterday we finally launched Buzz — Chat Safely on the Google Play Store and Apple Appstore. It’s pretty cool, check it out here:

The Only Time I Answer My Phone. Ever.,"The Only Time I Answer My Phone. Ever.

Once upon a time in the west, if you wanted to reach someone on the other side of the country you would send a message via Pony Express. Ten days later (or more) your message would be received.

Today, we can instantly communicate with others on the other side of the world in mere seconds. The channels for reaching each other have not only become lightning fast, but they are also varied.

Today, we receive messages via text, apps, Skype, Google +, Facebook Messenger and email.

And oh yeah, there are still those of us who use a telephone to (gasp) make a phone call.

I use, and embrace, all the technologies. But I’ve recently been thinking about how I not only use them, but how I prefer others to engage with me.

I feel there is a pecking order for each of these. So allow me to propose a “chain-of-command,” if you will, for when to use each type of tech for reaching out. I’m going to intentionally speak in first person as you may approach things differently.

#1 — Email

Email is most accessible, and I believe, the lowest rung on the ladder for reaching out to me. This is especially true if we’ve not met.

I’ve set up a contact form on my website and it invites anyone to send a message, whether it be for a speaking inquiry, joint venture proposal, question, comment or anything else. Since I receive these directly, it allows me to sift through and prioritize the most important messages and contact as needed.

The fact that I can search email and easily find what I am looking for makes it tops in my charts for both initiating contact and continuing conversation which can be documented and referenced.

#2 — Social Media

Next up the ladder is social media. Whether it be via LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter or any other place where I have a public profile, this is a great way for someone to reach out.

One of the problems with LinkedIn is all the spammy messages that end up in my inbox. There’s a whole lot of unsolicited proposals for search engine optimization, network marketing opportunities and job prospecting. I even get the occasional firm that wishes to help with my social media presence. Apparently, someone isn’t doing their homework.

Still, I’m fine with people reaching out by sending a direct message on Facebook or Twitter. In fact, Messenger is a great way to ping me with a quick question, a hello or a useful link. I don’t mind keeping my Facebook chat turned on because there are some happy interruptions throughout my day.

However, please don’t send any information that I need to keep track of via one of these services. Social media moves very quickly, and unless specifically requested, it’s likely that your request will get buried way beneath the fold. Phone numbers, addresses, emails and other important info are always best recalled if sent to email.

This, however, does not apply to Skype or other messenger services where you must be “added” as a friend in order to make contact. Unsolicited inquiries via these means can feel intrusive. I am selective in accepting friend requests, otherwise I wouldn’t be able to keep Skype on. Messages would come throughout the day and render the service annoyingly unusable.

#3 — Apps

And likewise, as we move into apps, we are entering the acquaintance zone. Whether What’s App (which I don’t use), GroupMe or any other chat app for my phone, these are to be used only by people I have a relationship with. I keep all notifications turned off on my phone so as to not be constantly having to look at what’s going on. It’s best if only family, friends and business associates who I am directly connected with contact using an app.

#4 — Text Messaging

As we climb towards the very top of the ladder, we encounter texting.

This is a highly personal method of reaching out, and not for a first time contact. There must be an established relationship with an intentional sharing of numbers in order for a text message to be okay. If you text and we don’t have an existing relationship, you have chosen poorly. If you are a family member (obviously), a friend (duh) or a close business associate (hi out there!), I am more than happy to get a text from you. Go ahead… say hello. I’ll probably respond with an emoji.

However, and I refer back to my comments on messaging in general, I don’t like to end up in long conversations on text… except when I do. In general, if it isn’t pressing I find that email is the best place to have longer conversations. That, or actually speaking.

#5 — The Phone

Which leads me to the top rung. The phone itself.

I put my cell number on the do-not-call registry a few years back. As a result, I don’t get too many telemarketers calling.

My phone number is a very personal thing. Again, family, friends and business associates who I have given my number to are free to call anytime.

I only answer my phone under three circumstances:

1) I see who it is because they are in my contact list. If it’s one of my kids, I’ll pick up unless I am speaking on stage. Even then, I’ve picked up the phone before in front of an audience just to let them know I’m here and will call them back when I am done talking. If it’s someone else, I’ll pick up if I am able. If I can’t, I figure if it’s important they will leave a voicemail.

2) I am expecting a call from someone in an area code but I don’t have them in my address book. For example, if I list something on Craigslist and I give someone my number to call so we can discuss the item.

3) I’m bored and want someone to talk to. If I get to this point and I pick up the phone, I may answer with a foreign accent and confuse the crud out of you. I’ll be entertained and you’ll wonder how you got the wrong number.

Under no circumstances will I pick up my phone if the display says “Blocked” or “Unknown.” This automatically weeds out most bots and telemarketers. It also gets rid of most fundraisers and political action committees.

Those who really need to get a hold of me will leave a message at the beep. I always listen to my messages and return calls as time, need and/or interest allows.

Confused? It’s okay. I’ve gotten a little dizzy just trying to sort this out.

Essentially, what this amounts to is a set of healthy boundaries. They are boundaries that allow me to enjoy and embrace technology while not becoming a slave to it.

What boundaries do you have in place for contacting you? Do you agree with mine or would you have minor or major modifications? Please share your thoughts with me below! That would be a very appropriate form of communication.",https://medium.com/@joelcomm/the-only-time-i-answer-my-phone-ever-77f56e7dc8aa,['Joel Comm'],2015-10-21 22:08:38.034000+00:00,"['Messaging', 'Facebook', 'Phone']"

Several years ago, I was facilitating a retreat for a large Atlanta law firm. During one of our business development exercises, I heard an older lawyer tell a group of new partners, “You don’t know your clients unless you know the name of their dog.”

His advice has always stuck with me, but upon reflection it seemed to me better advice would have been to not only know your clients’ pets but to know their “pet projects” as well — the community organizations, charity, civic group or volunteer events they care about and support.

If its not obvious from the plaques, certificates of appreciation, etc. on their office walls the causes they support, ask them. Armed with this knowledge, here are a few things you can do:

Get on the group’s mailing list, so you’ll always know how you can help.

Donate money or goods to the cause’s auction in your client’s name.

Instead of spending your time entertaining your clients, spend that time volunteering with them in support of their cause. You’ll get the same one-on-one time, but will be helping out those in need. As a extra bonus, you’ll likely meet several of your client’s peers.

Find out what is the most pressing issue facing the organization (or its members), and offer to give a seminar to help them understand it better.

Donate a percentage of that client’s fees to their cause as your holiday gift the client.

Your clients will not only appreciate your interest in their cause, but you might gain an interest in theirs.

"Airbnb: Bad For New York, Great For Me","Airbnb: Bad For New York, Great For Me

We got back from Portland last night and I already had an email from Airbnb. It was brilliant, and I like to think inspired by Tinder. The email said my hosts had already reviewed me (as a guest, ostensibly as information for future, potential hosts), and that to read it, I had to review my host. It continued:

Hosts and guests have 14 days to share feedback from a trip. The reviews will only be public after both are completed, or at the end of the review period.

Between us, Dustin and I have used it a handful of times now but the last time I actually logged in to leave a review was in 2012, when the whole thing was more novel. In fact, when our baby was a newborn, we used Airbnb in Woodstock, New York, and when our car broke down the hosts let us stay another night. We talked all weekend about mailing them wine, coffee, babka, $100, etc. At the very least an amazing review for this couple who basically renewed our faith in humanity.

We forgot to even leave a rating.

But this time, I had to see what they said about me, duh. I left a review this morning, as soon as I was sitting at a computer. (They were very nice.) (It was a husband and wife duo, and the wife works at a bakery, and they brought over baked goods one night that we had for breakfast in the morning.) (I mean, come on.)

I guess like most things in this new disrupted world of ours, I think Airbnb is bad for New York, but when family is in town and needs a place to stay, that’s exactly where I send them. On her last visit, my mom stayed in a place one block from us for $60/night.

Which is a little bit like the fact that our house doesn’t use Amazon, and hasn’t for a few years now, but then I watched the pilot for Transparent the other day and fell in love with it, and signed up for a 30-day trial of Amazon Prime. No money has exchanged hands, and I have a reminder set in my phone to cancel it, but still I’m sure they benefit somehow. I had, to use the words of a reporter who just emailed me about a story, “queasy” feelings about using the ‘service economy’ to hire someone to clean our house. But still, I got my house cleaned for $30. [Then of course heard from Amanda and emailed Handy’s customer service to get my credit card info removed from their site — a thing you can’t do yourself, which is bullshit.]

I’m a hypocrite, I guess is what I’m saying.

When I was booking this Airbnb, I was surprised at checkout when I actually got charged $53 for “Occupancy Taxes” by the state of Oregon, the city of Portland, and Multnomah County. Of course my first reaction to being hit with that and the $51 service fee from Airbnb was “dammit.” $100 more than the total I had in my mind. “I support this in theory!” I chatted to Mike. “For other people!”

I was joking, and even though it was a little painful, it helped me feel less ‘queasy’. Or it does now, after the fact.

Portland, as it turns out, was both as rainy and as lovely and its reputation would have you imagine. I am happy to give them $53 for the pleasure of staying in a pink-walled mother-in-law suite of a bungalow on one of their tree-lined streets, where we walked through the gray morning to go to brunch at a totally uncrowded, reasonably-priced, amazing restaurant.

A month ago, Airbnb published a blog post with a bunch of PR stuff, but near the end they do say this:

…we believe that it makes sense for our community to pay occupancy tax, with limited exemptions for those who earn under certain thresholds. We would like to assist New York City in streamlining this process so that it is not onerous.

This is promising. Of course, the consumer will be the one to pay this tax, just like I paid for it in Portland. Yes I wish it came out of the Airbnb fee or even the host’s profits, but when stay at a hotel you pay the occupancy tax yourself, too. Staying in a private section of someone’s house is different, but it’s not that different. Next time my mom or dad or sister comes to stay in an apartment in the neighborhood, maybe they will cringe, too, at the extra charge. It’s still better than the $400/night hotel down the block. Better for my family that is. For New York, tax or no tax, I’m not so sure.",https://medium.com/the-billfold/airbnb-bad-for-new-york-great-for-me-1a06538f8bff,"[""Meaghan O'Connell""]",2015-12-09 21:23:37.929000+00:00,"['Airbnb', 'Hotels']"
