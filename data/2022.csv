Niger Delta communities in ‘great danger’ as month-old oil spill continues,"This article originally appeared in Mongabay.

Oil has been spilling from a wellhead in Nigeria’s Bayelsa state for a month now, with the local company responsible unable to contain it.

Experts say the scale and duration of the spill is so severe that it’s imperative that local communities be relocated for their safety.

Oil spills and other forms of pollution caused by the industry are common in Bayelsa, the heart of the oil-rich Niger Delta.

Companies, including foreign oil majors, are largely left to self-declare the spills that frequently occur, but face only token fines for failing to respond quickly.

Crude oil from a blowout has been pouring into creeks in the Niger Delta since Nov. 5, with the well’s owner, Nigerian energy firm Aiteo, unable to contain the spill and specialists called in to help.

The blowout, at a non-producing well in the Santa Barbara field in Bayelsa state, has caused extensive pollution of rivers and farmland in the Nembe local government area, according to the state governor, Douye Diri. According to the News Agency of Nigeria, he said Aiteo should not think that “this criminal neglect of its facilities and disregard for human life and the environment, as demonstrated by its conduct, will not be accounted for.”

In a statement released Nov. 22, the company blamed the incident on sabotage. “Aiteo remains committed to ascertaining, immediately the well head is secure, the immediate and remote causes of the leak which will be driven by a [joint investigative visit] that will follow,” it said.

The oil industry in Nigeria attributes many oil spills to sabotage by people trying to steal crude. Nigeria’s National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), which relies almost entirely on the industry itself for access to on- and offshore oil facilities, reports that around 75% of spills are caused by sabotage and theft.

The joint team initially despatched to the Nembe spill was unable to determine the cause of the spill, as the wellhead could not be accessed “due to hydrocarbon fumes that saturated the atmosphere in the area.” A video of the spill site, captured Nov. 29, showed a high-pressure stream of brownish liquid spraying through the creeks from a wellhead as technicians worked on the site.

The scale of the spill has overwhelmed local disaster response capabilities, and U.S.-headquartered oil-well control specialist Halliburton Boots and Coots has been drafted in to “kill the well,” a process that involves injecting cement into the well to plug it.

“Work is still ongoing at the site to stop the spill,” NOSDRA director-general Idris Musa told Mongabay last week, but all activities around the well were temporarily suspended Nov. 29 to allow the well-kill operation to proceed.

Decades of destruction

The Niger Delta is rich in biological diversity and natural resources. Its creeks, swamps and mangrove forests are home to fishing and farming communities as well as threatened species including manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ellioti), and the Niger Delta red colobus (Piliocolobus epieni).

But decades of oil production have made the region one of the most polluted places on Earth. NOSDRA recorded 639 oil spills in just the past two years, resulting in 28,003 barrels spewed into the environment, according to the agency’s data.

Bayelsa is where oil was first discovered in Nigeria, in 1956. In the decades since, oil spills from wells and pipelines have contaminated farmland and water bodies, and exposed residents to toxic chemicals. Flaring of gas has led to acid rain falling on the area, while contributing to making Nigeria the 17th largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions in the world.

This environmental destruction has been caused by oil majors including Shell, Chevron and Eni. The Nembe well was bought from Shell by Lagos-based Aiteo in 2015.

“It is extremely disturbing because the trend we are seeing now is that international oil companies know that their equipment are dilapidated, and to avoid responsibility, they move offshore and sell to gullible local companies who think they can make profit and are not ready or equipped to [deal with] this kind of emergencies,” said Nnimmo Bassey, an environmentalist and founder of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), a prominent green NGO in Nigeria.

Consequences — just not for oil companies

The impact of the Nembe spill on local communities and the environment is still to be determined, but Samuel Oburo, an environmental activist affiliated with Friends of the Earth, who lives about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Nembe, says villagers in the area have been badly impacted.

“I can tell you that the people there face great danger. They have started crying out. They have started experiencing strange illnesses due to the unfriendly atmosphere this spill has exposed the community to,” he told Mongabay over the phone.

But getting oil firms to clean up or pay for environmental crimes in Nigeria is difficult. Legal claims for compensation can take years, even decades, and companies are expected to pay relatively little in fines when they err.

NOSDRA’S regulations say oil companies have 24 hours to respond to the discovery of a spill. A joint visit by government agencies, company officials and community representatives should take place as soon as possible. But a 2018 study by Amnesty International found frequent delays, with some spills continuing for months after they were reported.

Shell, one of the largest operators in the country, visited spill sites within 24 hours on just 26% of occasions, Amnesty said. The slowest response time recorded was when Eni took 430 days to respond to a spill in Bayelsa state. “These delays point to serious negligence. Shell and Eni are wealthy, powerful multinationals: why can’t they act faster? Why can’t they do more?,” the report said.

But the penalties for noncompliance are negligible: 1 million naira ($2,400) for an initial default, and an additional 500,000 naira for every day after that.

“How much is N500,000 to an oil company?” NOSDRA’s Idris Musa said. An amendment increasing the fines is in progress.

Speaking to the ongoing spill at Nembe, HOMEF’s Bassey said that considering the apparent scale and duration of the latest spill, the safest option for residents of the area is to be relocated. “This area does not have pipe-borne water, and when the river is covered with crude oil, it means they have to depend on imported water,” he said. “Some may drink from that river because these areas are permanently polluted and they have no option. Children will swim in that river and people will drink from that river.”

“Crude oil contains very toxic heavy metals like lead; you know, lead affects a lot things concerning people, the nervous system, causes cancer. You have mercury in oil, you have cadmium, you have arsenic and benzene and many others,” he told Mongabay.

“So anybody eating fish from that river is in trouble already. So the relief that they are giving, I believe they should actually evacuate people from that territory at this time.”

Oburo agreed: “So long as the spill continues, there is nothing that can be done to restore the air quality. The only solution is to evacuate those people from there because their lives are precious.”

Bayelsa government spokesperson Dan Alabrah said the state is providing relief materials to communities, but had no plans to relocate them.",https://medium.com/@deepgreenresist/niger-delta-communities-in-great-danger-as-month-old-oil-spill-continues-30393bb648a4,['Deep Green Resistance'],2022-01-14 13:16:28.085000+00:00,"['Energy', 'Featured', 'Oil', 'Food Security', 'Human Health']"

Kyber Ecosystem Report #28 (2021 Recap),"Happy Holidays and Happy New Year! We are delighted to bring together the most exciting developments at Kyber Network in this year-end ecosystem report for 2021. It’s been a really eventful year for the Kyber community!

Among many updates, we successfully completed our Kyber 3.0 upgrade and the DMM has been rebranded as KyberSwap after requests from the community. Yes, KyberSwap is back, better than ever 😎

KyberSwap is on 6 chains now: Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, and Cronos, with more on the way. On these networks, you can instantly swap tokens with the best rates via DEX aggregation, earn by adding liquidity, and participate in liquidity mining for bonus rewards.

Total Trade Volume: Over $4B

Over $20M in fees collected for 20,000+ liquidity providers

All-time-high TVL of ~$500M and $50B in Amplified Liquidity

Another highlight of the year: Backed by our strong community and various ecosystem activities and media coverage, Kyber recently crossed 200,000 Twitter followers! Huge thanks to our Kyber Network $KNC community for your strong support through these years!

Below we give a recap of what transpired this year and share our key focus for 2022.

KyberSwap

After months in beta, DMM was relaunched as KyberSwap with a seamless user interface to provide the best trading and earning experience in DeFi.

✅Trade at the best rates via DEX aggregation

✅Liquidity Providers earn more with dynamic fees and high capital efficiency

✅Audited by ChainSecurity, Insured by Unslashed Finance for $20M

KyberSwap was recently deployed on Fantom and Cronos (first DEX aggregator to launch on the Cronos network), and now brings the best token rates to 6 supported blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Fantom, and Cronos (more networks like Aurora/NEAR coming soon!)

We look forward to providing the best token prices and enhanced liquidity for traders, liquidity providers, and Dapp developers on any network we are expanding to.

⭐️ You can easily use KyberSwap to swap tokens at the best rates on supported networks and farm bonus rewards! KyberSwap will improve the overall trading and liquidity provision experience for ecosystem users, Dapps and NFT games.

Dynamic Trade Routing (Aggregation) for the Best Rates

KyberSwap users can get the best rates due to DEX (decentralized exchange) aggregation via our novel dynamic trade routing algorithm. This saves users time and effort when swapping any token!

KyberSwap sources liquidity across these different DEXs to help achieve the best prices for any token swap, on any supported network. The optimal route is identified and trades split through 30 DEXs (over $26 Billion in combined liquidity catering to 20,000+ tokens), including KyberSwap’s own liquidity pools, to find the best rate on different chains — Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Fantom, and Cronos.

Popular decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, Sushiswap, Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, Pancakeswap, Traderjoe, Pangolin, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, VVS Finance, and more have already been integrated.

Swap any token at the best rates on KyberSwap! Some of the popular tokens available at the best rates:

Single Token Deposit

Adding liquidity into a pool is a core function for thousands of liquidity providers. With our new Single Token Deposit feature, you can use just one token in the pair (e.g. ETH in an ETH-KNC pool) to deposit and add liquidity to the pool, and receive the corresponding liquidity provider (LP) tokens, all in one seamless transaction.

Single Token Deposit makes liquidity provision even easier, saving you time and effort!

Easily add liquidity into pools using either token in the pair, all in one seamless transaction.

When removing liquidity, you can also automatically convert it to your desired token (either token from the token pair) in a single transaction.

ZKyber: New L2 DEX Trading Experience based on ZK-Rollups

Building upon our past research into Rollup scaling solutions, we unveiled our ZKyber testnet on KyberSwap! ZKyber is an L2 scaling solution that provides a faster, cheaper, and fairer DeFi trading experience on Ethereum, with anti-frontrunning capabilities.

PPC Management Services,"What is PPC marketing and what are it’s benefits?

Let’s begin with the fundamentals. What is PPC? PPC is a pay-per-click type of online advertising where the money is paid for each click to a landing page. Pay only for the action you want to target.

This kind of advertisement is considered to be the most effective and efficient method of driving quality traffic to your website in a short time. Promotions aren’t shown to people who are not your target audience. They are shown to people who have similar interests and searches. These are your potential clients if you’ve set up your campaign correctly.

The term “contextual advertisement” is a reference to this particular fact. It is based on the user’s previous and current web searches. It is displayed in a specific context, such as search terms or content on the web page. When you launch the PPC campaign, the advertiser will specify exact keywords and set limitations on where it is, when, and in what order the advertisements should be displayed. Contextual advertisements can be a form of a text fragment, a graphic banner animation, or video.

Before we go on to the details for setting up context ads, be familiar with the fundamental definitions and be aware of the meaning behind PPC can mean in terms of marketing and the way it functions.

In contrast to SEO ( Search Engine Optimization ), it takes time for websites to rank organically on search results. PPC is an approach to online advertising that helps get your site to the top of search results. At the top of Google quickly. It’s a good strategy for companies seeking to boost traffic flow and convert SEO-related campaigns to gain traction or for businesses that don’t want to spend money on SEO.

Benefits of PPC for Small and New Businesses

The most efficient and cost-effective advertising method on the internet, PPC is a particularly crucial lead generation tool for smaller and newly-established companies that aren’t yet competing for organic search listings. It allows you to compete against large corporations to compete with the same audience, depending on your budget.

In addition to the obvious advantage of increased exposure on the web, PPC is also typically employed to increase sales and boost brand recognition. Since it is an effective form of advertising, it can reach people who are actively searching for your services or products and are more likely to buy.

Before you begin with your initial PPC advertising campaign, think about your budget, your advertising goals, and your risk tolerance. Would you be better off hiring an experienced PPC firm to oversee your campaigns to ensure that you are getting value out of your budget? If you’re confident in the decision to run your PPC campaign on your own, be sure to have clear goals for conversion in your mind and a realistic budget to begin. Remember that you can always get assistance by contacting experts like the PPC experts from TBA, regardless of whether you’re planning your first or your 100th PPC campaign.",https://medium.com/@texasbusinessanalyticstba/ppc-management-services-f1dada6501e3,[],2022-01-21 14:00:11.130000+00:00,"['Digital Marketing', 'Tba Services', 'PPC Marketing']"

Bunker 2171 Labs in The Sandbox Game NFT Metaverse,"What is The Sandbox Game? The Sandbox is an open, decentralized metaverse that enables artists and consumers to create, build, and own digital assets secured on top of the Ethereum blockchain network. These digital assets or Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are the items and project-specific avatars that players can earn and use for the wildly diverse gaming, entertainment, and social experiences being developed inside The Sandbox ecosystem. For those less familiar with this new ecosystem, the Sandbox Map proves to be an excellent tool to help visualize where individual experiences are being built by world-class artists.

Sandbox NFTs and their use cases are wide-ranging and are often a critical reward component for an emerging new gameplay model, play-to-earn (P2E). In contrast to older pay-to-play models, a P2E game rewards the gamer for participating in the experience, often with in-game items, NFTs, or tokens that the player now directly owns. These NFTs or tokens can be used within the game, sold on marketplaces, or potentially used in other Sandbox experiences. The Sandbox is also interesting in that the actual infrastructure itself is available to own. SAND, the native token of The Sandbox ecosystem, is used to purchase surprising large grids of virtual real estate via the frequent Sandbox land sales.

The Sandbox Game is currently in the Alpha stage of development, with the role out of the Sandbox DAO, virtual concerts, and over 1,000 games throughout 2022. Gaming veterans, world-class entertainers, and major brands building in The Sandbox include Atari, Roller Coaster Tycoon, The Walking Dead, Adidas, and Snoop Dogg. With The Sandbox raising more than $93 million from investors in 2021 alone, it’s a safe bet to think that the entire ecosystem is staged for significant developments in the future and will likely be positioned as one of the premier metaverse experiences in this new web3, blockchain-enabled internet of value.

Bunker 2171 Labs NFT Ecosystem

Being open and decentralized means that many individuals and projects are also building unique experiences in The Sandbox, including the ambitious ecosystem from Bunker 2171 Labs. Bunker 2171 was conceived by the founders and developers who go by the pseudonyms in the Bunker 2171 discord, John Kongor, and General Reese. Bunker 2171 is a continuously growing set of NFT collections; interconnected with utility elements to incentivize holding, maximize value return to their owners, and facilitate a rapidly growing ecosystem. The first collection, MutantKongz, was originally an homage to the CyberKongz project; however, the MutantKongz collection has rather distinguishing, mutated features that begin to tell the story of the post-apocalyptic, sci-fi themed world that these creatures inhabit.

MutantKong #481, the first collection from Bunker 2171 Labs, was originally minted on June 12th, 2021.

Discussions with the developers and supporting team paint an interesting picture that begins to illuminate the influences that are driving the creative engine of the Bunker 2171 ecosystem. The entire project is oozing with fandom and love, inspired by popular video games like Fallout, Metro, Half-Life, and The Last of Us. Additionally, each of the six interconnected collections and the main story often artistically incorporate pop-culture influences from blockbuster films, including The Terminator, Aliens, Predator, 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, The Book of Eli, and The Road.

The Bunker refuge provides not only safety but also a place to relax and socialize with fellow MutantKong and Gorilla Nemesis avatars.

Enter the Bunker, a recently discovered refuge for the MutantKongz and allies. With power recently restored, the Bunker is shaping up with comfortable living spaces, an armory, and many additional rooms to accommodate an ever-growing group of survivors. In addition to MutantKongz the second collection, Gorilla Nemesis also contains incredible illustrations with the Predakongs, Deep Space Aliens, Terminators, and always intimidating, Immortals.

Excellently capturing the collection tone, the Gorilla Nemesis teaser trailer provides a sense of the team's incredible artistic range and direction for each subsequent collection within the ecosystem. Excitingly, both MutantKongz and Gorilla Nemesis NFTs will have 1:1 avatars available for gaming and social experiences in The Sandbox. Each avatar will function not only as your vehicle to the Bunker 2171 gaming experience but will also serve as a 3D extension of personal identity for those who use them as their PFP, only now fully mobile in the broader Sandbox ecosystem.

Diving further into the Bunker 2171 ecosystem, one discovers a variety of collections and creatures to explore and own. Collection #3, Bunker Chronicles, drives the evolving narrative of John Kongor, the resistance leader and guide for all survivors who discover the Bunker, told in a highly captivating comic book style format. Meanwhile, collection #4, Bunker Beasts, were made available for free plus gas for each Gorilla Nemesis NFT, with a claim window that will remain open indefinitely for Gorilla Nemesis that still have unclaimed Bunker Beasts. The Bunker Beasts are a wild combination of heavily mutated and accessory wielding animals, including Bats, Beatles, Flys, Mantis, Spiders, and Octopuses. With tech-enabled flying bats, backpack octopus explorers, and snapback hat-wearing flys, a unique world identity and sense of humor are interwoven and blended across each separate collection, mirroring that of the overall Bunker community.

Continuing their prolific collection release cadence, on November, 19th 2021, Bunker 2171 Labs simultaneously launched their 5th collection, DraGONS 2171, and initiated the $AMBER token yield system. The native token fueling the Bunker 2171 ecosystem, one $AMBER is generated per day for each DraGON. Furthermore, both Gorilla Nemesis and Bunker Beast each provide a one percent $AMBER bonus yield boost for each DraGON that you own. This unique incentivization model encourages holding the assets long term and is one of the numerous collection utilities, resulting in a significant cumulative $AMBER bonus yield as each DraGON will generate $AMBER for a total of 2,171 days. In total, there are approximately 3,700 DraGONS in the collection with surprising few available to purchase on the secondary market, signaling a pivotal collection in the Bunker ecosystem.

The 6th and most recent collection from Bunker 2171 Labs, the Alien Kimera Protocol (AKP), was activated on December 18th, 2021. With absolutely stunning artwork from Mvrk, the talented illustrator and 2D animator of the Gorilla Nemesis and subsequent Bunker 2171 collections, the Alien Kimera also provide a critical utility purpose as the Bunker team looks forward to expanding their presence and offerings in The Sandbox. While MutantKong owners will receive a free 1:1 avatar, the AKP will also enable Gorilla Nemesis holders to claim a 1:1 avatar if they also own an Alien Kimera and use 60 $AMBER for the claim. In total, the Bunker 2171 community will initially have 5,500 MutantKong and Gorilla Nemesis avatars available for their social and gaming experiences currently being developed in The Sandbox. The $AMBER token will also have several additional short to mid-term utilities, including use cases within the marketplace, loot boxes, rewards, a gaming experience access pass, and auctions.

The MutantKongz are nomadic apes, survivors of the nuclear war that left a once highly technologically advanced civilization in total ruin. This setting is where the Bunker 2171 story begins and sets the foundation for their P2E gaming experiences in The Sandbox, appropriately named Wasteland 2171. Harkening back to games like Fallout: New Vegas, Wasteland 2171’s thematic tone is one of mystery and danger. In a genre-blending world with advanced AI, genetic engineering, devastating weaponry, and terrifying monsters, the Bunker provides not only a dedicated in-game social hub but also serves as a refuge from the dangers lurking outside.

Beyond a social hub, the Bunker is also one of the critical locations for players to explore within the upcoming P2E gaming experience. Wasteland 2171 will cover a 3x3 Sandbox land plot of the total 6x6 Bunker 2171 estate (Sandbox Location, 35, -204) currently being built. Bunker 2171 developers and internal Sandbox artists have teamed up with the incredibly talented Blaze Games Studio for the Wasteland 2171 gaming experience. Blaze Games is a highly-skilled group of artists and developers whose Sandbox work includes but is not limited to the RESP_WN game experience and the impressive Gutter Cat Gang, Gutter City.

While 1:1 avatars are closer to completion, the proposed Wasteland 2171 assets and game design have recently been approved by The Sandbox, with all involved parties continuing development throughout 2022. There are numerous narrative-driven objectives or missions planned for the Wasteland 2171 game that offer a range of engaging gameplay experiences. These missions include restoring power and supplies to the Bunker, protecting each other from raiders, rescuing allies in trouble, and uncovering critical information that will piece together the overall Bunker 2171 story.

Each mission will take you on an engaging journey across the Wasteland and aims to become a wild destination for gamers who are seeking a wide range of experiences, challenges, and rewards. Coupled with a dynamic crafting system, rewards for playing Wasteland 2171 include crafting weapons, armor, and consumables. Additionally, skins and exclusive loot boxes for MutantKong and Gorilla Nemesis holders will also be available.

All told, an exciting year lies ahead for the team and Bunker 2171 community. Not to be overlooked, the community is a core pillar of the Bunker ecosystem and the discord is where many initially find themselves when learning about the impressive level of existing project utilities and the upcoming estate in The Sandbox. Friendly team members are always vigilant at the Bunker doors, welcoming new survivors who make it in from the outside world and are commonly greeted by a hilarious barrage of cleverly crafted memes and gifs. The friendly and helpful nature of the community is why many choose to lend their expertise and skills to help build for long-term success. These Apes invite you into the Bunker 2171 discord to stay a while, have some laughs, learn about the ecosystem, discuss the upcoming Wasteland 2171 gaming experience, and prepare yourself for the next Sandbox adventure.",https://medium.com/@david.roeseler/bunker-2171-labs-in-the-sandbox-game-nft-metaverse-d8ca91350647,['David Roeseler'],2022-01-04 15:19:03.680000+00:00,"['Bunker 2171', 'Metaverse', 'Thesandboxgame', 'The Sandbox', 'Nft']"
How to Invest in The Metaverse: A Step-by-Step Guide,"How to Invest in The Metaverse: A Step-by-Step Guide

Several simple- order deals this time worth millions of bones have put the word‘metaverse’at the tip of our speeches.

The metaverse is a virtual world that druggies can explore using personalised incorporations. It extends beyond gaming and allows callers to interact nearly and witness colorful conditioning in real- time. Experts believe the metaverse now represents a unique$ 1 trillion profit occasion.

How to invest in metaverse

There are three methods of investing in the metaverse :

Purchase metaverse commemoratives

Buy in- gamenon-fungible commemoratives (NFTs)

Purchase virtual land in the metaverse ( also vended as NFTs

Let’s see how you can invest in the metaverse with two simple methods.

Step 1: Create a crypto wallet (common for all)

Every purchase, just like physical goods, requires a portmanteau full of plutocrat. You need to produce a crypto portmanteau and cargo it with currency for investments in the metaverse.

For purchase of metaverse commemoratives: WazirX, CoinDCX, and CoinSwitch Kuber are the most popular options.

WazirX, CoinDCX, and CoinSwitch Kuber are the most popular options. For NFT purchases: The most popular crypto portmanteau encyclopedically is MetaMask. Coinbase and Binance are also good options. Utmost NFTs are Ethereum- grounded, so it’s stylish to buy the ether (ETH) cryptocurrency with your traditional currency.

Corroborate your identity to validate your portmanteau by completing know your client (KYC) formalities.

Step 2 Create an account on the platform of your interest :

Purchase metaverse commemoratives The easiest way to land these commemoratives is to head to crypto exchanges like WazirX or CoinDCX and use your currency- loaded portmanteau to buy the commemoratives directly. Among the most sought-after metaverse commemoratives are the MANA, the native currency of the Decentraland metaverse; SAND the currency of Sandbox metaverse, and the AXS, the native currency of the Axie Perpetuity metaverse.

Buy in- game NFTs/ own virtual land You’ll need to produce an account with the game you wish to make purchases in and connect your crypto portmanteau with their account. For illustration, log on to Decentraland for virtual real estate, Axie Perpetuity for characters and land plots, Sandbox to buy/ vend cultural creations,etc.

You can produce an account with OpenSea if you wish to pierce all the NFTs in one participated business for convenience.

Step 3: Select the NFT you wish to buy and make the payment:

Still, you’ll notice that NFTs don’t have apre-decided selling price, If you browse any of the below platforms. One must bid for it and beat all other stab to gain power of the NFT. Paying for the NFT is also snappily reused through the portmanteau you created and filled with cryptocurrency in Step 1.

You must remember that there are trends and downsides to buying from a primary business (Decentraland, Axie Perpetuity, Sandbox,etc.) and the secondary business (OpenSea,etc.). An NFT on the primary business will inescapably have a advanced resale value. Still, it’s harder to estimate its true value in the primary business. It’s because you can compare the price of one NFT against that of others on the secondary business that displays all NFTs on one common platform.

The Metaverse: An Introduction,"A computer is a window into a multiverse of possibilities. Software Engineering and Experiential Design are the tools that compile the DNA of this virtual world.

This statement has been the first thing people see on my LinkedIn profile for the past few years and it’s starting to take on a whole new meaning. We are about to head into 2022 (crazy right?!) and there is an overwhelming amount of information floating around the Internet on this thing called the Metaverse.

I’ve been wanting to write something about the Metaverse for a while now but I wasn’t sure where to start. There are plenty of great breakdowns out there already (some of which are linked below) that provide a great picture of where we are now and what the future might bring. Let’s see if I can help educate some folks as well.

The goals of this article are:

Practice writing Introduce myself Write about my passion outside of my day job — mixed reality and how it will change our lives

Feel free to skip ahead if you have no interest in the human being banging away on his keyboard to bring these words before your eyes (or ears if you’re using a screen reader).

In my day job I’m a Director of Engineering and Software Engineer at fuboTV. How I got there after a close shave with becoming a Physical Therapist is a whole other story that I will hopefully write in the future. Outside of fubo when I’m not playing video games as Jakonius (Jah-Koh-knee-us) or taking LinkedIn Learning courses, I am a technology and Metaverse fanatic. Learning is a central tenet of my life and always will be. The way I see it is if you were a video game character, wouldn’t you constantly be trying to level up? That endless learning and exploration has gotten me obsessed with the ideal version of Augmented and Virtual reality that is depicted in our favorite shows and movies.

User Interface while wearing AR glasses in Free Guy

Whether that is the Augmented Reality glasses put on display in Free Guy or the immersive cops and robbers depicted in the classic movie Virtuosity with Denzel and Russel Crowe. In fact, Justin Long’s role as a computer hacker in Live Free or Die Hard is one of the main reasons I wanted to get into computers and programming.

Although these technologies are not new, there is a convergence of factors that will bring these realities from the the movies to our real lives. That convergence is what we will get into here. That being said, I want to warn you that this article will not be very in depth.

There is a ton of information floating around out there and it’s tough to know how to organize it. That’s what I’m here for. To read what is the heck is going on out there and explain what it all means and what’s coming in the future. At least I’m going to try. So here we go.

Let’s break it down:

What is the Metaverse?

Who is trying to build the Metaverse?

How will we access the Metaverse?

Who knows what else? Probably a lot!

What is the Metaverse?

The phrase “Metaverse” was initially coined in a 1992 Science Fiction novel by Neal Stephenson called Snow Crash. A great book that I definitely recommend checking out. “Metaverse” is a combination of the prefix “meta,” which means beyond, and “universe”. So, the Metaverse is a world beyond the real world or universe. (i)

That aligns with my thoughts on the Metaverse as an extension of our physical reality in its ideal state. It encompasses both augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences. But I lean towards AR as the true victor of our attention. I guess my one liner at this point would be:

The Metaverse is a personalized multiversal experience accessed through technology where users can view and interact with 3-dimensional digital objects as if they were a part of our physical reality.

The definition of multiversal according to the Internet is a collection of parallel universes that comprise all of reality. Quite a fitting definition for everything we’ve said so far about the Metaverse. You already know some of these parallel universes and they are hiding right in front of your eyes through the screens you use everyday. Think Instagram, Gmail, Netflix, TikTok, Call of Duty: Warzone, YouTube and Amazon.

Now you might be saying, how are those parallel universes? That’s where the fun begins. Right now each of those experiences is accessed through technology like a mobile device, tablet or computer as an App or Website. But in the future all of those experiences will be accessible through your AR glasses and associated haptic accessories rather than a multitude of other means and screens.

What will shopping on Amazon be like in 3 dimensions through your AR glasses? Do you think you’re ready to drop into Warzone while you’re wearing a haptic suit like Ready Player One and running on an omni-directional treadmill?

There are endless scenarios I could walk you through describing some of these experiences that are here now or on the horizon — but we’ll save those for a different day. Let’s move onto the myriad of companies trying to build these digital realities.

Who is trying to build the Metaverse?

Well the easy answer is everyone. You’d have to live under a rock to not know some of the biggest players entering the space - cough cough Facebook…I mean Innovative Online Industries (IOI)…I mean Meta. In addition to Meta here are some of the biggest companies that are making waves in the Metaverse.

Each of these companies are working day and night, spending millions if not billions of dollars to capture a piece of the next computing paradigm shift. Whether they are building the hardware to access the Metaverse, software that will be used within it — or both — they are all making some serious moves and have been for the last few years behind closed doors.

Here’s where things get interesting. I still haven’t mentioned blockchain, cryptocurrencies or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In my mind there are two versions of the Metaverse — centralized and decentralized. That’s a rabbit hole I’m not ready to dive into yet (common theme for this article but bear with me, I’m just getting started).

There are a few platforms in the crypto space worth mentioning that are either building a decentralized Metaverse owned by the people or a marketplace to buy and sell NFTs:

Metaverses:

NFT Marketplaces:

Wilder World and Zero.tech are well on their way to building a photorealistic Grand Theft Auto style universe powered by Unreal Engine 5. In this game users actually own their digital assets which are fully functional NFTs and can be used to make money in the form of $WILD or $ZERO tokens. Wilder World is the inaugural planet in Zero space. Think of the Oasis in Ready Player One as Zero space and Wilder World as the first of many planets. As this is a gross over simplification, for a full breakdown of Wilder World and Zero I encourage you to check out this wonderfully written article by @barthillerich.

Decentraland and Sandbox are similar platforms to Wilder World but look more like Minecraft rather than Grand Theft Auto. You can buy and sell digital assets including plots of land which have been selling for millions of dollars. Someone even spent $450,000 to be Snoop Dogg’s virtual neighbor! What a time to be alive.

More recently I discovered Metaclub Society. This one caught my eye because I do enjoy a good party. Metaclub Society is building a Metaverse focused on being the hub for the wildest parties, casinos and adult entertainment. Each NFT holder will gain access to these parties both in the Metaverse with their 3D avatars and in real life (IRL) places like Miami - which is quickly becoming a city of the future.

Opensea.io is a peer-to-peer marketplace for NFTs, rare digital items and crypto collectibles. This is actually where I purchased my first NFT a little while ago in Wilder World. Coinbase is another company actively working towards releasing their own marketplace for NFTs. Clearly the world is trending in this direction and we will see further development over the next few years as we move from early adopters to mass adoption.

Now that we’ve explored a few of the companies and organizations building their small corner of the Metaverse, let’s dive into some of the technology that will allow us to enter it.

How will we access the Metaverse?

Technically we already can and do each and every day. Our mobile devices are an extension of ourselves and grant us access to all of the apps that our lives depend on. But what I’m talking about and what we’re all here for is the immersive, personalized and interactive AR/VR 3D Metaverse. Not some apps on a screen.

We’ve seen some examples of this through Snapchat and their Spectacles, Microsoft releasing Mesh and Meta changing its name while simultaneously declaring themselves as a Metaverse company. All the while Apple has been watching from the sideline and rumors have been growing around their mixed reality ski goggles depicted above. As an Apple fanboy I eagerly await their “one more thing” announcement that includes a mixed reality device.

Here are the pieces of hardware that allow us to enter the Metaverse.Some of them are either available now while others are predicted to become available in the next few years:

These are in no particular order but rather what I could think of and subsequently Google to find a link to match. There are plenty more out there which shows the space is growing rapidly. Their capabilities range from mirroring your laptop to provide extra screens to full fidelity AR with 3D models and occlusion. While the market is surely growing - unless someone else surprises me - I fully expect Apple to change the game once they bring their rumored devices to market.

There were touch screen smartphones before the iPhone and digital music players before the iPod - but we all know how both of those products released by Apple took over the world. I expect nothing but the same in the mixed reality industry. Keep an eye on Apple from now on if you hadn’t already. 2022 could be the year they actually reveal what they’ve been cooking up and why Tim Cook touts AR like that’s his only job.

Who knows what else? Probably a lot!

There are so many other topics I could get into and a few rabbit holes I avoided above for the sake of releasing this initial article. I even stumbled upon the Metaverse 2030 story by Louis Rosenberg a few days before I planned on publishing this and almost rewrote the entire thing!

Trust me, I’ll keep going. This is just a taste. A dabble, one might say. When I learn how to organize my erratic and excited thoughts about this area of technology I’ll be back to walk us through the multitude of multiversal menagerie that awaits us in the 2020s and beyond!

While you wait for my return, check out some of these resources that have helped me understand the Metaverse and where we are headed:",https://blog.cryptostars.is/the-metaverse-an-introduction-1529b6203c5a,['Jake Posner'],2022-01-04 17:01:55.833000+00:00,"['Virtual Reality', 'Mixed Reality', 'Augmented Reality', 'Metaverse']"
The real reason Facebook is changing its name to Meta,"A bright future for investors, consumers, & developers alike.

To the “untrained eye”, you might find it interesting or unfathonmable that one of the only competitors Oculus currently thinks it has is “Epic games.”

To those unfamiliar with Epic games, they are the creators behind Unreal engine & the world's #1 battle royale game Fortnite. (You might have heard of Fortnite on the topics and recent lawsuits with Apple)

So shouldn't Oculus view maybe steam VR, HTC Vive, Google, or any other tech giant as their main competitor?

Wrong. Like I mentioned again and again in this article, one of the main audiences of this year's conference is investors. Zuckerberg wants to make a statement that they are so many years ahead of the competition and have already spent so much money in R&D of their VR products none of those companies can come close to competing with them. (Which I would argue probably is true, Facebook makes a lot of money) Facebook/Meta, in the foreseeable future, will probably still make a lot of money. Therefore it will be hard for any new VR headset start-up to keep up.

Fortnite itself generates revenue of around 7 billion USD yearly.

This is a lot since Fortnite is just one video game under Epic games. However, when compared to Facebook’s massive estimate of 85.6 billion revenue yearly is nothing.

So clearly they cant compete money-wise, why bring Epic games up then?

Epic games own Unreal engine which they are putting a lot of effort into giving VR development support. Their ultra-successful game Fortnite is built on this platform. Similar to how Epic games has the Epic games store to compete with Steam. If Epic tries to launch their own headset, they actually have a unique competitive advantage.

Don't believe me?

Here's why. Remember how in the first part of the article we mentioned Oculus kept emphasizing they are adding new games to attract their gaming customers? Well, Epic games own the unreal engine platform and a massively popular genre(Fortnite) which is a massive pre-established paying customer group. (7 billion revenue from a free-to-play video game remember?)

Perhaps with some speculation, you can conclude Epic games surely is working on VR projects, and if they were to launch something, there is definitely a huge competitive threat to Oculus.

However, everyone here over at our Sword Reverie team does not think Epic & Oculus bumping head to head is the most likely outcome.

What we would speculate is Epic probably has lots of high-level stakeholder meetings with Oculus where they talk more about collaboration, and how they can support each other to create a true metaverse with a Fortnite Creative in VR.

With VR growing in popularity Fortnite sure wouldn't want to lose out on a whole market of paying customers similar to what has happened with mobile on the Apple store.

One of our past Sword Reverie designers and current UX coaches I work with, Hannah, is currently working as a UX designer part of the Fortnite team. Although due to NDA she can’t share with us what she is working on, or confirm if my speculations of a top-secret VR Fortnite collaboration is coming soon.

But one thing is clear, Fortnite is becoming more of a social experience.

You see, Fortnite has been so successful because it has grown far beyond a simple battle royale game. It is a metaverse in itself. (Fortnite refers to itself now as the Fortnite Metaverse, see some similarities with Facebook calling itself Metaverse too?)

In Fortnite, you can watch live concerts from Ariana grande, be anyone you want to be (no seriously from DC to Marvel, Predator to the terminator, Anime(Naruto) to Will Smith, you really can be absolutely anything you want to be), hang out with friends, or build your own city.

Does all that sound familiar like I just mentioned it before? Does it almost sound exactly the same as the goals Oculus has? Well yes, it does, there is a lot of overlap.

So with my pure wild speculation, I will say a collaboration between Oculus and Epic is more than likely, both companies have a lot to gain from each other.

To me as both a designer and a serious Fortnite fan? Well, that is just great news. I would be so excited for a Ready player one style future built on the existing metaverse Fortnite and Oculus has been creating for us, and I can't wait to create new cutting edge designs in it!",https://uxdesign.cc/the-real-reason-facebook-is-changing-its-name-to-meta-what-you-must-know-from-facebooks-2021-e8f12cdc797c,['Leon Zhang'],2022-01-11 20:56:00.464000+00:00,"['Virtual Reality', 'Metaverse', 'Oculus', 'Facebook', 'User Experience']"
"NFT: If My Calculations Are Correct, When This Baby Hits Maturity, You’re Gonna See Some Serious Shit*","Lionel Messi is 12 years old. He’s like a little foal that runs from here to there on an unpredictable mud plain playing soccer in a ‘potrero’ (paddock). You are one of a couple of dozen viewers there. You notice that there is only one handheld camera filming the children’s game with a boring commentator. Some are already talking about that amazing kid. Those present are astonished at this skilled child. Suddenly for you the screaming of the people, the speed of the number 10 and the fervor stop. As a spectator you realize that you are witnessing the birth of one of the biggest stars that football will give birth to. What to do? With your iNeuron you take a snapshot of the moment, parading like an imaginary flash and… Boom! You imprint that image on your memory with fire. The year 1999 is passing. You have a unique, own, unforgeable memory in your head. How do you turn it into a transmittable, exclusive, interchangeable, and collectible reality? How?

You still do not know the comments that Ray Hudson will make of Messi when he reaches the first team of Barcelona FC. You don’t even know who Ray Hudson is! Nobody in that place can project the trajectory that the little one will have. Many viewers cannot see beyond the reality of the pasture mud. But you smile, you see beyond that context. You do not listen to the naysayers, nor to the short-sighted, nor to the sheep of flocks that swing on their comforts without ever leaving the fold. You trust your intuition and listen carefully, scrutinize the signs. Something great will happen with that kid. But what can you do but be amazed and smile?

With your iNeuron you check the mementos you have. You notice that the same thing happens with them as with the incipient football that Messi scattered in front of you in 1999. You want to unite the two things and you comment on it with the spectators. Again, you hear the laughter and hordes of serial scoffers. They mock at your exaggeration and flatly deny that these worlds can ever intersect. Have a real and virtual memory on a card of that genius that you can save, exchange, and sell? Let there be! Their closure will be their downfall, their denial will be their problem.

This has probably been the case since the dawn of Humanity when the first men wanted to artistically express what they had inside, materializing stored memories. First with hands and animals drawn on the stone, then with clay crafts, with enzyme paint of flowers, oil, papyrus and tapestries. The reactions will have been one of mockery, surprise, indifference and admiration. With the ability to create came that of copying and falsifying.

What if… while you were witnessing the birth of something new, you captured it in an artistic work? What if… you would have asked that tiny Messi for a gift shirt? What if… you would have bought the ‘Lionel Messi’ brand? What if… you would have associated yourself with his image? That tricky but disturbing question: What if…? One possible answer is that to predict the future many times you must travel with your mind to the past. See the circumstances, trends, opportunities that have passed and seek to understand why and how it is that they were not taken advantage of. This is how you will define not to miss an opportunity today.

Virtual Real Estate May Not Appreciate Like Physical Real Estate,"A realtor’s concerns regarding their potential as long-term investments

Image provided by user Benholfeld via Wikimedia Commons

Real estate is powerful. It’s one of the most reliable asset classes, and much multi-generational wealth has been built on top of it. People everywhere aspire to own some, and now that NFTs have enabled the ownership of digital parcels, the virtual landgrab is officially on. There are naysayers, of course. However, those who have made it their business to understand the implications of “Web 3.0” are nearly unanimous in their excitement to claim some digital space for themselves. Some, like myself, are more hesitant. But they mostly make reference to the bubble-like nature of the current pricing trends. My own apprehension is more related to concerns about the long-term investment value of this whole asset class.

In short, I doubt that an investment in virtual real estate will perform like most investments in physical real estate do. They certainly have potential over the short term. We see that in the blooming resale market. They also have some capacity for generating revenue during their use. But, will they appreciate over the years like brick-and-mortar homes do? I’m dubious about that. Here’s why.

Population arcs

My first time spent in a beautifully crafted and open virtual world was with a game called EverQuest. I got into it around the year 2000, and it was probably the single most memorable gaming experience I have ever had. At that time, though, you couldn’t own anything in its world. You were merely a participant. I loved the game all the same, and I can only imagine my excitement if I could have bought my own treehouse in the city of Kelethin, or maybe opened up my own shop in Freeport. Regardless, I spent hours upon hours exploring the world of EverQuest, and thousands of people were along for the ride. It felt magical.

In 2004, word came down from Sony that EverQuest 2 was on its way. And in November, it was out. I recall how the talk in our guild during the run-up to its release was “Who’s sticking around?”, and the painful realization that — despite all the hours and dollars we sunk into the first title — more than half of us were on our way over to EQ2. On the day the sequel came out, the guild was rather suddenly gutted of members, and the whole world of Norrath did seem to be a bit emptier. But, it turned out that the blow we felt when EQ2 launched was really just a jab, and a right cross was following shortly behind. World of Warcraft landed later that month, and it was basically a wrap from then on. Everyone wanted to play WoW. As the new MMORPG’s population grew, it felt as if a hole had been punched in EverQuest’s bucket, and players were draining out of the game by the day.

This was to become the pattern across basically all open, multiplayer worlds. Even the mighty World of Warcraft wouldn’t be immune. Its user numbers would grow until about 2010, and then trend back down, ending with a sort of “long tail” pattern that continues playing out to this day. Among MMOs and other games, the population figures tend to operate according to the same dynamics: they increase alongside the excitement surrounding the latest virtual world, then flatten, and finally decrease as enthusiasm wanes and other options proliferate.

But, compare these virtual world population charts to the actual populations of countries and states. It’s a very different pattern, and this is critical for real estate. Real estate consistently appreciates over the long haul largely because human populations rise, but the amount of land stays the same. You can essentially count on a general increase in demand, without a corresponding increase in supply. Our experience with virtual worlds —although admittedly they are not metaverses — indicates that they do not behave in the same way. Their population grows, and then tapers off. Demand is not on a steady path upward when viewed in the long term.

Not enough scarcity

The supply side is also problematic. The constant innovation and iteration typical of digital life means there’s no shortage of virtual space for us. While many individual metaverses are governed by DAOs that make it difficult to arbitrarily increase the supply of parcels, there’s nothing inherent to the digital medium to stop land from being minted and driving down prices. So, even if weren’t possible to have more land minted on platform X, there’s always platform Y. As things stand in the real world, there is no alternative to our current platform: Planet Earth. Moreover, just like the old real estate chestnut goes, the thing about its land is “they’re not making any more of the stuff”.

Because we can mint new land or establish new metaverses altogether, virtual real estate has a potentially infinite supply. That doesn’t eliminate scarcity altogether, of course. A given metaverse may mint X number of parcels and that’s it. Or, there may be only a certain amount of land close to some desirable feature. That’s also scarcity. But, it’s of a different sort than the basic scarcity we experience with land in the real world.

It is true of physical real estate that it generally appreciates over time, but this is due to its particular supply and demand situation. Both of those forces get distorted significantly in the virtual realm. We see a bell-like arcs in the populations of people demanding the land, and there is always the possibility of creating more supply somewhere.

Volatility

I also believe virtual real estate is likely to remain somewhat volatile as an asset — more so than its physical counterpart, anyway. The friction in the market is just so low. To illustrate what I mean by that, let’s imagine we live in a place on Earth called “Foolistan”. It’s a nice-enough country, Foolistan, but it’s run by idiots. We, its informed but helpless citizenry, are subject to their terrible policy decisions. And as a result, we feel a certain level of motivation to get ourselves out. Fortunately for the State, there is a lot of friction in the emigration process. We need passports and visas, we need to sell off our larger assets and find a way to transport the rest, we need to learn the new language and customs of whatever country we’re moving to, and so on. The fact of the matter is that most people will need to experience a rather high level of distress before they’re willing to go through the trouble of moving to new lands.

In the virtual environment, such barriers to entry and exit are quite a bit lower. We are capable of moving to a new metaverse rather quickly if it interests us. Our tokenized assets are quite liquid compared to physical real estate. And, to top it all off, new worlds are opening up all the time! This will likely make virtual real estate riskier and more volatile than its physical counterpart. The Internet is fickle, and even if you choose well and invest your time and money in a wonderful platform, there’s always the possibility that a better alternative (or a sequel) could arrive and crash your asset’s worth by making it “yesterday’s meta”.

Finally, there’s the common practice of basing a virtual real estate economy on the platform’s native cryptocurrency. These are currently very unstable relative to most fiat currencies, and their swings in value are likely to affect the markets built on top of them. Even if things in your chosen metaverse are going great, if there’s a problem with Ethereum generally(or whatever its preferred currency may be), you can imagine that there will be repercussions in your investments.",https://blog.cryptostars.is/virtual-real-estate-may-not-appreciate-like-physical-real-estate-does-66103c23f3be,['Jeran Miller'],2022-01-01 14:41:44.795000+00:00,"['Metaverse', 'Blockchain', 'Virtual Real Estate', 'Real Estate', 'Nft']"

Wilder World tops the class in Metaverse megatrend,"by XpTheVerse

We all know The Sandbox and Decentraland when it comes to the metaverse but there’s now a third player that has joined the conversation.

Wilder World is a fully decentralised 5D photorealistic metaverse being built on Unreal Engine 5. The project will be a community owned virtual nation with the first city being created as a 1-to-1 geographical replica of Miami which they have named Wiami.

Wiami has been developed with a futuristic vibe, reminiscent of 80s Miami, but with a CyberPunk flair and a touch of fantasy. If you have played the Blockbuster game GTA- Vice city (also based on Miami in the 80s)you should understand what they are going for.

Gaming will play a key part in this metaverse with Player vs Player (PvP) and Play to Earn (P2E) gaming. One of the first micro-games available in Wiami lets users put their skills to the test and street race Wilder Wheels vehicles around the city for NFT gains.

Property and land will be purchasable which opens up a plethora of opportunity to stake an early claim in the World.

The $WILD token is already on the market along with multiple NFT sets with future utility including the following:

· Wilder Wheels (cars),

· Wilder Crafts (flying vehicles),

· Kicks (wearable sneakers)

· Cribs.(apartments)

Some cribs have already sold as high as 39Eth! Here is the link for the Opensea collection

Can this metaverse seriously be built?

Wilder World was founded by 3D artist Frank Wilder has been in development for 7 years. With many projects claiming to be metaverses yet having been in development for much shorter times you can be confident this project is the real deal.

There should be no concerns this metaverse will be built on stock items purchased from digital asset stores as WW is being built by artists who will create originality with their work.

The world is being created by artists who are part of a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) which in Frank Wilders words will ‘create a project more ambitious than any single artist could do on their own’.

Frank Wilder has been called the ‘Banksy of the blockchain’ and I highly recommend you check out the calibre of visuals this metaverse will have by checking out some of his insane personal 3D art here

Follow the smart money

One strong strategy in Crypto has always been to follow the smart money. There are several notable entities backing Wilder World which carry undeniable weight when investing.

· Digital Currency group (DCG) stand out from the crowd when viewing Wilder Worlds investors. Founded and led by Barry Silbert, DCG sits at the epicenter of the blockchain industry and counts one of its subsidiaries as Grayscale (the worlds largest digital assets manager). You can be assured the due diligence process carried out by an entity such as DCG is of the highest quality and can only instil much more confidence within an investor like yourself following them into a project.

· Animoca Brands the number 1 heavyweight investor in the space. If you track the projects they are partnered with you will clearly see a common theme of success.

· Jake Paul and Anti Fund was another masterstroke from the team. World famous You tuber and now boxer Jake Paul’s Anti Fund enterprise are invested in WW. He has already discussed plans to open a boxing gym in Wiami and racing his NFT Wheels in the street racing game. What else does Jake Paul bring to the table?…… a gateway to on ramp mass adoption to the Wilder World metaverse! Imagine the exposure Jake Paul can bring with his 10s of millions of followers on social media! Check out his interview with the Wilder team.

Bad tokenomics kill a project; good tokenomics can make one

The $WILD tokenomics are healthy, show a commitment to their investors and show commitment to the growth of the metaverse ecosystem.

1. The breakdown of token distribution shows no high anomalies to any one party.

2. 50.2% of the total token supply spread across areas focused on building the community and ecosystem:

· Artist incentives 6%,

· Community Building 10%,

· partners and ecosystem 10%

· reserve 24.2%

3. The token itself holds utility as the governance token, voting rights in the DAO, staking options and to be used in the Wild ecosystem for trade.

4. An Initial public sale raise of just $250k was a great early sign of the commitment to investors over greed for grabbing money

5. The low initial market cap of $900k (Private sale and public sale) gave great growth potential for the earliest investors. Wilder World clearly put their investors first here, great sign!

6. The vesting periods for investors are gradual and staggered

7. Etherscan shows there is no one wallet holding a dangerously excessive amount that you should be concerned about.

The projects that rise to the top are the ones with the strongest communities

Imagine the feeling of being directly connected to the founders and team of a project and with them truly valuing your input in the development and evolution of it. This is how the majority of Wilder community members feel if you ask them. These behaviours from the Wilder team have instilled a contagious confidence amongst the community which has turned the majority into long term holders and ambassadors.

A community built on long term holders and not short term flippers has been proven to be the best ingredient for the long term success of a project, you can see this in the growth of projects such as Illuvium and Star Atlas for example.

The Wilder team have demonstrated consistent engagement, communication and transparency. A couple of recent examples emphasis the true nature of the Wilder team:

1. During the minting of the 501 Wilder craft NFTs there were unfortunately some failed transactions with high gas fees. Within 24 hours the Wilder team had announced to the community they had created a compensation form for anyone affected to fill out. The people affected are now having compensation claims processed. In Q1 they aim to have a layer 2 solution in place for minting to prevent this happening again.

2. An Impromptu Discord AMA was carried out by the wilder team where they actively asked for the communities’ opinions and solutions on many topics. The team initiated this brainstorming session after a build up of differing opinions on strategies to complete the road map along with other short-term concerns within the community. The following day the Wilder team announced they were acting on the points discussed.

The current community has been grown completely organically with no marketing spend. As it stands now their twitter account has over 80k followers and the discord over 25k. A recent disclosure from the Wilder team is the plan to spend $2–3 million a month on marketing! No better time to join the community now before it explodes!

The most successful projects are led and driven by true visionaries

With over 100 people across 15 countries working on Wilder World you can be confident this metaverse has the means to deliver. Led by Frank Wilder a true OG creator in the space, co founders; n3o the architect, Hypno Wilder, Phoenix Wilder and marketing from Quantum Wilder all sharing the same vision.

Frank Wilder got into digital art in 2013 and minted his first NFT in 2017. Previous to the digital art he was a very successful in physical art with clients such as Justin Bieber and Kevin Durant. Frank Wilder has his own You tube channel to check out

Ex pro skateboarder turned artist Chad Knight recently left his position as Head of 3D design at Nike to join Wilder World. He has been creating some amazing wearables for the metaverse. Check out some of his work here

With such proven artistic talent and credibility amongst the creators of this metaverse, you can only imagine how visually spectacular this World has the potential to be.

How is the product shaping up

So what about the actual product? I would start by checking the following cinematic trailers

· Wilder World

· Wilder Wheels

· Wilder Cribs

· Wilder Crafts

· Wilder Wheels Tier C

The current reality of investing in these AAA projects is that some patience is needed before you can get your hands on gameplay loop footage and early access to the Alpha product.

It is still early in the project so there have only been small snippets of gameplay released at times. This is about to change with the imminent release of an Alpha version of the street racing element to selected community members. Stay tuned!

What you can check out is the AAA calibre of graphics on the NFTs currently on the market. I challenge you to find another metaverse project hitting the level of quality of these.

My thoughts as an investor

Investors in the current wave of crypto games and metaverses are putting in a lot of early trust before a minimum viable product is available for people to experience.

As a potential investor Wilder World currently sits in the above bracket. However, that said, every due diligence test myself as a researcher and investor have put it through, this project has passed with flying colours.

All roads point to the Wilder World Metaverse being the leading front runner in the 1st wave of photorealistic metaverses built on realism and not akin to the Sandbox model.

How to make money with the Horizon Worlds Creator Fund,"Horizon Worlds

Facebook recently hit the VR industry like a meteor with their announcement that they were changing their name to meta and going to be investing $10 billion into VR and their new metaverse platform, Horizon Worlds.

With this announcement was another announcement that they had created a $10 million dollar creator fund for people who were interested in becoming creators with the Horizon creator tools and making worlds for other Horizon users to visit.

But how can you dip into this pool? Information can be a bit hard to come by, but the steps are relatively simple overall. There are a few different methods.

Trending AR VR Articles:

1. Join community competitions. If you’re interested, you can sign up for more information about the $10,000 Horizon community competitions. After checking out previous winners, I believe that it wouldn’t be difficult to make a winning experience. A tip: making games requires diving deep into logic and code blocks, but if you make a relaxing “explore” experience it’s far easier to do.

2. Join the creator accelerator program. Details on this are a bit fuzzy, but according to people who have already joined it, payment is based on rating and popularity of the worlds that you create. The more visitors you get, the larger the payout. According to one developer in the program (who asked not to be named) his largest check was for $6200 in one month.

Before you get accepted into the creator program, it’s possible to begin making your worlds on your own. The steps for this are relatively simple as well. You need to own an Oculus Quest 1 or 2, but it’s recommended that you own a Quest 2 for the best experience. Once you have it, download Horizon Worlds from the app store. Inside, you’ll need to complete a short tutorial before being able to begin creating.

The metaverse concept as a real product is brand new, but as it explodes, it’s smart to be on the front of the wave. Early adopters, especially people who are interested in creating experiences for it, will find themselves richly rewarded. Like people who learned to program in the 90s, or learned to work bronze at the end of the Iron Age, learning to use and create for VR means you’ll be several steps ahead of everyone else, financially and socially.

The Power of Experiential Learning with the Metaverse,"Now that we know experiential learning using moving imagery in a mistake-encouraged environment is crucial to learning new things, let’s move on to how Virtual Reality (VR) in the metaverse comes into play.

But what is the Metaverse?

The metaverse, like the universe, is a world, but unlike our universe, it’s virtual. It’s a world that’s entirely confined to the internet and is accessible through VR and AR headsets. The word “meta” means beyond and “verse” comes from the universe; you can think of it as a world beyond what’s known as the universe

Virtual Reality or VR for short is the use of technology, like headsets, to create a 3D, simulated environment online.

Augmented Reality or AR for short is using technology to augment or change the environment you are already in. An example of this is a Snapchat filter; it changes your appearance, but you haven’t been transported into a new world.

Applications for VR in Learning

Language Learning

In school, we learn a lot about writing and reading in a foreign language, but what about speaking? At least for me, the most important part of learning a foreign language is being able to actually speak it which we aren’t taught very much in the classroom. But with VR in the metaverse, instead of needing to travel to Mexico to practice your Spanish, you can become immersed in the virtual city streets, hearing authentic Spanish to practice your accent. Since two big barriers in becoming fluent in a language are geographically being immersed in the world of the language and having the confidence to speak it, in a virtual world, there’s no pressure to speak it perfectly, and it’s no big deal when you mess up.

Public Speaking Practice

Photo by Kane Reinholdtsen on Unsplash

Imagine if you could practice the exact situation of giving a speech in a no-stakes environment.

With VR, you can put on goggles and get over your fear of public speaking by practicing in an environment that feels completely real, but with no stakes.

In the metaverse, it’s ok to make mistakes, in fact, they’re encouraged! Because that’s how we learn.

One company, Virtual Speech, does just that. (But this isn’t an ad for their company!)

With the continual rise of the metaverse, practice environments, like being able to give a speech in a real-feeling but fictitious environment are becoming more widespread.

Work Training

In situations where it’s difficult for workers to “learn on the job”, or it’s dangerous to practice certain situations, VR can be used as a practice environment before being thrown into the real world.

An example of this is STRIVR, a B-to-B EdTech company using VR goggles for companies to train their workers. One company STRIVR worked with is Verizon to train their employees on what to do in the event of an armed robbery. Training for this specific situation is quite difficult to do safely and cost-effectively in practice, but with VR goggles, the employees can practice in an exact replica of the situation as many times as needed. If you’re curious, you can read more about STRIVR’s project with Verizon here.

Another example is in law enforcement training.

In October of 2021, the University of Cincinnati partnered with Google to test and improve a VR training program for police officers called Trainer. In Trainer, the officers are put in life-like stressful situations (in the metaverse), and they can practice their response, so they’re ready the make the right call when the situation arises in real life.

The future of VR in law enforcement training has a lot of potential going into 2022 because of the hype of the metaverse and increased tensions amongst political groups and police officers.

Accessibility for People with Disabilities

Instead of being confined to a wheelchair, the metaverse allows everyone to be on the same level and have experiences no matter your physical limitations. Maybe you want to play a game of soccer for the first time or just hang out with friends without needing special equipment; all of this is possible in the metaverse.

Starlight, a non-profit dedicated to bringing happiness to sick children, is using VR goggles to transport hospitalized kids to their favorite places around the world, allowing them to explore and learn about the world without having to leave their wheelchairs.

The Future of Education and the Metaverse

The metaverse is a huge deal.

Reality Labs by Meta (Facebook) invested $10 billion in the metaverse this past year in 2021. In addition, the metaverse is estimated to grow to a worth of $800 billion in the next three years by 2024.

Language learning, public speaking practice, work training, and accessibility for people with disabilities are just four of the hundreds of opportunities for education innovation with VR in the metaverse.

So what are you waiting for?

TL;DR: Our education system is old, outdated, and ineffective. But, using experiential learning in a mistake-encouraged environment, the metaverse has massive potential to increase student engagement and make education exceptional for our next generation of change-makers.",https://blog.cryptostars.is/the-power-of-experiential-learning-with-the-metaverse-a8fb47aad040,['Emma Eisenhauer'],2022-01-06 21:45:00.750000+00:00,"['Innovation', 'Education', 'Virtual Reality', 'Metaverse', 'Edtech']"
Alethea AI Year in Review: 2021,"A roundup of a year full of successes, from launching the Noah’s Ark Intelligent Metaverse to building a thriving community

2021 has been an incredible year for us at Alethea AI. Here’s a roundup of the year’s successes, from our token sales and partnerships, to our community growth, to releasing first of their kind collections and our Metaverse development. Let’s dive in …

Noah’s Ark Metaverse and Alethea AI Ecosystem

This year we launched Noah’ Ark, the world’s first Intelligent Metaverse, which aims to preserve and evolve the culture and collective intelligence of the human species. Noah’s Ark is currently inhabited by The Revenants, Alethea AI’s own collection of the first 100 Intelligent NFTs (iNFTs). The Revenant collection features historical and cultural icons from throughout human history.

The Noah’s Ark Metaverse gave birth to our Train-to-Earn model. The Train-to-Earn model allows iNFT owners to Earn the more that people interact with their iNFT on Noah’s Ark. People can interact with the iNFTs by using the Recite, Broadcast, or Interact feature, depending on the Intelligence Level of the iNFT. In the short time since we’ve launched Noah’s Ark, we have received 3,287,691 API Requests. We have generated 847,658 videos and facilitated 112,730 interactions. There is an outstanding demand for the AI services that iNFTs offer and we expect this to grow significantly in 2022 and beyond.

Institutional Partners and Early Adopters

We felt extremely privileged and excited to receive acknowledgment and support from some of our early institutional investors, including Metapurse, Dapper Labs, Crypto.com, Multicoin, Bitkraft, Mark Cuban and many more through our $16 M private token sale.

In June, we partnered with Sotheby’s auction house and the artist Robert Alice to create and auction the world’s first-ever intelligent NFT called Alice. Alice sold for $478,800.

In Oct 2021, we launched the first iNFT collection called The Revenants, which broke OpenSea records for a collection drop, netting approximately $10M in a week and skyrocketing to becoming a Top 10 collection on OpenSea in the first seven day period. The Revenants collection has a distinguished provenance for being the first-ever intelligent collectibles, a pivotal moment in the early history of NFTs.

Shortly afterwards, the iNFT Personality Pods were sold for almost 1600 ETH, becoming a Top 10 collection on Open Sea by volume. We also conducted a generous giveaway of over 1000 pods to our early adopters for participating in townhalls and AMAs.",https://medium.com/alethea-ai/alethea-ai-year-in-review-2021-dce8967bf6fa,['Arif Khan'],2022-01-06 21:16:11.312000+00:00,"['AI', 'Nft', 'Metaverse', 'Blockchain']"
Faction Spotlight: Farmers. The Farmer Faction is primarily focused…,"Each faction of the Fief guild will be assigned specific roles and responsibilities to assist in the growth of the Fief treasury and adoption of the Fief Token (FIEF) as the primary reserve currency of the entire metaverse.

In return, these Factions will benefit from the productivity of the treasury reserve and natively generated revenue from all future protocols. These incentives will stack on top of the planned, systematic buyback programs that will link the value appreciation and productivity of the treasury reserve with FIEF.

Factions work to achieve the following:

Establish an internal, gamified economy within the Fief guild to diversify the methods by which we grow the treasury reserve. This will assist in reducing the impact of broader market fluctuations on the treasury’s trajectory. Offload aspects of in-game asset utility and coordination, further decentralizing the Fief guild and token economy while allowing the core team to focus heavily on treasury management, partnerships and shipping protocols. Incentivize users to work towards building Fief as the financial center of the metaverse while establishing a hivemind to target and control markets. Add a massive layer of currency utility to the FIEF via primary NFT sales and more.

Membership to each Faction will be organized using the Initial Guild Membership (IGM) NFTs that are being sold in early Q1 2022. The initial utility of IGMs is centered around the distribution of FIEF, but in time will evolve into core membership & access tokens to specific Factions and their respective revenue streams.

This mechanism allows for upfront IGM demand from all types of crypto users (speculators, traders, metaverse natives, etc.), which will feed into a healthy secondary market for the NFTs as Faction-layer utility begins.

While users may own IGMs & other Faction-based NFTs from across all factions, we are designing our hierarchy system to reward users who concentrate their capital and time on one specific faction. Ideally, users will find factions that:

Fit within their interests and expertise Accommodate their desired level of engagement Connect with them on a community-level

In time, Faction members (and the Fief NFTs they’ve acquired) will begin to represent units of value and influence within the guild — a concept that could very well expand into sub-economies that add even more revenue to the Fief treasury and utility to FIEF.

Farmer Faction

The Farmer Faction is primarily focused on virtual worlds and the LANDs that comprise them. This Faction, which is predominantly an in-game faction, is targeted towards two types of guild members:

Speculators who are bullish on the utility and value appreciation of virtual worlds.

Hardcore gamers who want to spend their days in the metaverse.

As the most scarce assets in the metaverse, LAND will serve as a bedrock for the spread of Fief’s influence and access to recurring treasury revenue. Owning major locations across popular virtual worlds will allow Fief guild members to congregate and plan strategic expansions.

The Farmer Faction will be tasked with the following:

Populating and working key LANDs from virtual worlds across all major supported projects

Interacting with other guilds and directly with native players to facilitate the adoption of our LANDs

Maximizing resource collection while working with the Merchant & Bishop Factions to help coordinate in-game strategy for deploying those resources

In return for this activity, the Farmer Faction will receive revenue rewards from LAND productivity. These rewards will be distributed directly to staked IGM NFTs and come in a variety of forms, including Faction NFT drops, FIEF and third-party token distributions, and more.

Passive Farmer Faction IGM holders (speculators) will greatly benefit from Fief’s virtual world activities. However, the reward weighting will progressively skew towards active participants over time as we introduce Farmer Faction NFTs that reward the hardcore gamers of Fief.

With this model, even the lowest rarity IGM purchaser will be able to rise in the ranks of the Farmer Faction to gain influence and outsized rewards. To stay competitive with the more active Faction participants, the speculators will need to purchase additional NFTs to retain the reward weighting, further driving revenue to the Fief treasury reserve and growing our token economy. More details on this dynamic will be published soon.

While Farmers won’t have direct influence over LAND decision making (this is a feudal system, afterall), this Faction will work closely with the future Fief royal class and governing bodies to help make strategic decisions related to activities such as the acquisition of key buildings or other assets that will further maximize the value and/or productivity of the LAND.

Despite the majority of virtual worlds still being in development, there will undoubtedly be competitive gameplay that the Fief guild will find itself involved in. Fief is being designed as a neutral party between guilds and warring parties (we want to supply everyone with the resources — war is highly profitable), but there may be a time in which our Farmers will need to take up arms to defend the strategic resources and LANDs that we acquire.

This will require guild-based logistics and a major part of our focus as the core Fief team will be the creation & management of the Fief coordination apparatus.",https://medium.com/fief/spotlight-farmer-faction-17cc0817f728,[],2022-01-06 16:00:29.962000+00:00,"['Metaverse', 'Gamefi', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Nft', 'Fief']"
Metakicks by Sneakmart. Whitepaper,"Our story

Sneakmart is the first community-driven app dedicated to streetwear fashion. Our users can easily share, discover, buy and sell sneakers & streetwear with confidence. Launched in France in January 2021, Sneakmart regroups a community of more than 140k users.

At Sneakmart we’re passionate. We started Sneakmart for one reason and this reason is the love we have for sneakers! We’ve been collecting, buying and selling sneakers for more than 15 years.

Sneaker addicts love to collect and wear a lot of sneakers. Everyone loves sneakers today (especially us), everyone wears them. With Metakicks, we want to give you the opportunity to start collecting digital sneakers through unique designs. We want to bridge the gap between collecting physical and digital sneakers.

What is Metakicks?

Metakicks is the first NFT collection of Sneakers distributed as mystery boxes. This means that when you buy a Metakicks box, you won’t know beforehand which pair of sneakers you are going to get inside. The lucky owners of these boxes will be able to choose to open them (or keep them closed) to discover which Metakicks is hidden inside. In total, 6250 Metakicks boxes will be available for purchase for this first drop.

Metakicks mystery box

Our team of sneakerheads worked hard to produce and imagine the best designs from iconic shapes and made them ready for the metaverse.

We took inspiration from areas that we love, and we used unique materials so you can have unique Metakicks that you won’t find in the real world. We created a total of 15 different designs, each design has its own theme and has been proudly created with love by our team.

These 15 designs will be randomly distributed in Metakicks boxes and are classified according to different levels of rarity: epic, super rare, rare and normal. Out of the 15 designs, there will be 1 “epic”, 4 “super rare”, 5 “rare” and 5 “normal” designs, with different quantities depending on the level of rarity.

Each pair comes from a specific universe and will allow the lucky owners to stand out in the metaverse.

Our vision

Our vision is to reinvent the buying, selling, trading, and discovery of highly demanded sneakers on a global web3 community-centric level. Historically, Sneaker collectors have been localized and limited to local infrastructure. What if we could unlock trusted Sneaker e-commerce on the global stage? How much bigger could the sneaker collector’s wardrobe be? How much more impact could we make if we can bring all sneaker collectors from across the globe to connect with other sneaker communities anywhere in the world?

We are Sneakmart and we are building a world Sneaker & Streetwear collector community. Our early contributors and NFT holders will start the global take over in the digital and physical world of the empire of Sneaker collecting.

Raise Finance IDO Tiers Explained,"Option 2 — RF-Karma support mechanism (RF- Karma)

Most Eastern religions believe that karma denotes the cycle of cause and effect — wherein every action affects the person at some point in the future. Karma also applies to your thoughts, your words, and the instructions you give other people. The RF-Karma Support Mechanism works on more or less the same principles.

The RF-Karma Support Mechanism is another way for participants to gain access to the IDO allocations, and participants here will have the opportunity to earn Karma points by staking or swapping previous tokens in exchange for IDO access. Only tokens launched by the Raise FInance team will be eligible, and this is another strong step towards boosting interest and demand for our projects. Our Raise Finance analysts conduct a detailed analysis of previously issued tokens on a periodic basis, and based on the current situation of the project, they will select tokens for the RF-Karma Support Mechanism.

How do I Earn RF-Karma Points

There are numerous ways for you to be able to earn RF-Karma points, and these have been discussed below:

Staking a specific token on Raise Finance: For every asset that you lock and stake on the RF platform, 2% is converted into RF-Karma points. This is issued once a week in the form of weekly karma and expires every month.

For every asset that you lock and stake on the RF platform, 2% is converted into RF-Karma points. This is issued once a week in the form of weekly karma and expires every month. Trading a specific token on Raise Finance: For every asset that you trade through Raise Finance, 2% is converted to RF-Karma points. This is issued once a week in the form of weekly karma and expires every month.

For every asset that you trade through Raise Finance, 2% is converted to RF-Karma points. This is issued once a week in the form of weekly karma and expires every month. Successfully submitting projects to Raise finance hackathons: For every successful project that you submit, you will earn 100 RF-Karma points that expire after 14 weeks.

*The specific conditions around the conversion may vary from project to project.

The top 250 wallets in each case that have the most RF-Karma points will gain access to IDO allocations.

The top 150 wallets from this will be part of Pool 1 and will share 70% of the total share.

The top 100 wallets from this will be part of Pool 2 and will share 30% of the total share.

Example

For example, if a Project ABC manages to raise a total of $200,000.

According to the pool weight distribution, the amount allocated to the RF-Karma Support Mechanism is

Total raise * 0.20 (PW)= 40 000$

Therefore, each pool gets allocated funds as follows:

Pool 1 = 40,000$ * 0.70 = 28 000$

Pool 2 = 40,000$ * 0.30 = 12 000$

Pool 1 and Pool 2 participants will get a guaranteed allocation proportionally depending on the earned points.",https://medium.com/@raisefinance/raise-finance-ido-tiers-explained-aff14185e328,['Raise Finance'],2022-01-09 20:58:33.608000+00:00,"['Metaverse', 'Blockchain Startup', 'Launchpad', 'Matic Network', 'Avalanche']"
"Index Coop — The Why, What & How.","When it comes to crypto, there is nothing but a fine line between value investing and speculating. Especially like the market situation we are in now where random projects are pumping or dumping fueled by hypes & trends.

Not all of us have the time or the expertise to #DYOR on every new project. But we can’t also just go around parking our money in the random 100x meme token your favorite social media influencer shilled to you. That would be a disaster.

We the people are in need of a solid product, that helps users invest in good projects in this space and do that so, in a systemic and user-friendly manner. Such products are brought to you by Index Coop — The #1 Crypto Index Fund Manager.

what is an index fund?

Index funds are financial instruments that track the performance of an index/bucket of assets rather than a single asset. The advantage of investing in a bucket of assets rather than a few selective assets is healthy diversification. “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, they say.

Index funds come with a huge potential to risk aversion. even if few assets in the basket perform badly or even go under, the investor of the index will relatively be in a safer position as his gains from other assets in the basket balanced the losses from underperforming assets.

Even though it diminishes returns to an extent, we can’t argue against the fact that such projects are even more necessary in the wild west crypto market than in traditional markets, Because in crypto there are hundreds of choices, dramatic price swings, and a market that never sleeps.

What is index coop?

Index Coop builds simple yet powerful index products to help you access crypto investment themes.

Their mission is to create a better way for people to join the crypto revolution. They are trying to do what traditional index funds helped retails investors to achieve, to grow their wealth in a stable way.

Index Coop has theme-based crypto index products, so the user has more freedom in choosing which type of asset their investment will be tracking, given that there are too many assets in crypto and it is hard to put them in one category.

Let me shill you some of their products!

Defi Pulse Index (DPI)

The Defi pulse index (DPI) tracks the performance of the top Defi project’s tokens. A single DPI token tracks the performance of all these Defi projects based on the weightage given to each project. The weightage depends on the circulating supply of each token.

Currently, these are tokens tracked under DPI.

The tracked assets are well picked that they have to have some predefined characteristics for them to be tracked in Defi Pulse Index.

The Token must be an ERC-20 Standard.

It should be related to Dapps listed on Defi Pulse.

The token must be decentralized enough so that it won’t be defined as a security.

Wrapped tokens, Tokenized derivatives, and Synthetic assets will not be considered for the index

Along with that the projects circulating supply, potential use cases, adoption, demand, age, and such metrics are verified before adding it to DPI.

DPI is an amazing choice for people who wants to get exposure to the growth potential that Defi applications create. Imagine buying into DPI before the Defi Summer of 2020.

Metaverse Index (MVI)

The Metaverse Index (MVI) tracks the performance of top metaverse projects. A single MVI token tracks the performance of all these Metaverse projects based on the weightage given to each project. Here weightage is determined by the market cap and liquidity of the token.

Currently, these are tokens tracked under MVI.

The tracked assets are well picked that they have to have some predefined characteristics for them to be tracked in Metaverse Index.

The token must be an ERC-20 Standard.

The project should be listed in coingecko in any of these categories — Non-Fungible Tokens, Entertainment, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Music.

The protocol must have at least 3 months history of operation and the token must have at least 3 months of price and liquidity history (must also have considerable Ethereum DEX liquidity).

Along with that, the project’s security audit will be considered before including it into MVI.

MVI is the go-to product to get exposure to the growth potential created by the new metaverse craze in the market (MVI did a 10x run from the lowest point this year, after the metaverse craze started by Facebook rebranding itself Meta).

Bankless BED Index

Bankless BED Index took a unique approach to create an index product that is soo wholesome covering the three major themes of crypto — Store of value, Programmable money & Decentralized finance with equal weightage.

A single BED token tracked the performance of Wrapper Bitcoin, Wrapped Ether & Defi pulse index (DPI) with equal weightage.

For a project to be included in BED,

It must have a market cap above $25B.

the protocol must be widely used either as a network or as a smart contract platform.

the asset must have sufficient liquidity for initial inclusion and further rebalances.

ETH 2x Flexible Leverage Index & BTC 2x Flexible Leverage Index

These are cool index products that track the performance of the 2x leveraged positions of those respective assets. This is extremely useful for leverage traders who take collateralized loans to leverage their positions.

When the market faces sudden negative volatility, the chances of the collateralized loans getting liquidated to cover the position are high. Using ETH 2x-FLI or BTC 2x-FLI, the users don’t have to manage or monitor their leveraged position, any action required to avoid liquidation like rebalancing collateral will be done by index managers. Users can just get the benefits of a 2x leverage position at ease.

It internally uses cETH as collateral to get a USDC loan and uses the USDC to buy more ETH. the debt & collateral is accessed through compound finance.

Note: ETH 2x-FLI is also available in polygon, we don't have to worry about high ETH Gas fees while buying it.

Data Economy Index (DATA)

Data Economy Index (DATA) tracks the performance of data-oriented new-age blockchain projects. This is another avenue in which blockchain is trying to revolutionize the existing system.

Currently, all our data is controlled by the big tech monopolies whose track records call for attention to its ethical standards on how it uses user data.

Currently, these are the tokens tracked under DATA,

Community-Driven DogCoin NFT Gaming Experience,"CollarQuest

CollarQuest is a community-organized NFT Gaming Experience powered by CollarToken ($COLLAR). CollarQuest is a game based on the story of robot dogs called SPARC-E (Sentient Programmable Assault & Reconnaissance Canine-Entity). SPARC-Es are NFTs with random characteristics, abilities, and skills. These NFTs can be played, sold, or transferred in and out of the game.

The game takes place in Ariomont, the SPARC-E homeland. Ariomont is divided into tokenized plots of land which act as homes and bases for their SPARC-E. Plots can be upgraded over time using various in-game resources and crafting ingredients. Landowners can also find $TAG tokens or SPARC-Es on their plot of land, and use them to explore further.

There is also a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) behind CollarQuest, which means the community hodlers influence the actions of the project. The project is very community-oriented and infuses purpose, utility, and direction into the DAO. All developments, roadmaps, and opportunities are planned with the community’s input in mind.

Tokenomics

CollarQuest’s main token is $COLLAR, and is supported by their governance token, $TAG. TAG is still going through their tokenomics review, but its goals are to provide a market-competitive incentive for staking and farming of $COLLAR and $TAG to receive rewards. $GeM is another one of their supporting tokens, which can be used for in-game purchases, breeding, and upgrades.

The tokenomics behind COLLAR include a 95% return to treasury and reserves that are under the control of CollarQuest DAO HODL. $COLLAR is an ETH- and MATIC-powered token available for purchase on Quickswap and ShibaSwap.

The contract addresses for all three tokens are as follows:

CollarQuest Academy

In the game, a CollarQuest Manager (a player who has enough SPARC-E) can seek a cadet (someone who doesn't have enough SPARC-E) to play the game for them using their SPARC-E. The Genesis Mechanism ($GeM) earned by the cadet will then be split between the manager and the cadet based on their agreed-upon split.

What’s Your Financial Plan for The Metaverse?,"What’s Your Financial Plan for The Metaverse?

The Collins Dictionary declared NFT ( short fornon-fungible commemorative) its word of the time — and similar commemoratives form a crucial part of the burgeoning virtual macrocosm. Everyone from gamers to inventors to diplomats feel eager to get into the metaverse before this interpretation of the future arrives.

Still, should you have a fiscal plan for it? Rare will be the mainstream counsel who tells you to drop$ 1, If the future is the metaverse.5 million on a many plots of digital land. And the jury is still out on how and if the metaverse can indeed take shape.

But as we wind down this time of meta mania, it would be prudent at least to have some sense of the ways this new means of working, playing and investing might affect your budget.

At the same time, you will know what to say when someone in your family inevitably asks you, over the sheets of paper, “What is metaverse, anyway?”.

Investments in Digital Means: A virtual macrocosm creates virtual investment openings. Digital land prices are roaring. Republic Real Estate, a establishment that has raised plutocrat to buy worried condos in the physical world, launched a fund before this time aimed at investors seeking to buy virtual land. The adventure plans to buy parcels across several online “ metaverses” and develop them into virtual hospices, stores and other uses, with the thing of adding their value among cryptocurrency suckers.

Of course, NFT art has come one of the buzziest digital means this time. And Thomas Olsen, a mate at Bain &Co., lately said he sees all means being tokenized 20 or 30 times in the future. “ All stocks, all bonds are going to be on a digital asset platform that is being erected by the crypto testing moment,” he said.

Online-Only Shopping and Gests: Online shopping will get indeed more complicated if brands have their way. They’re formerly making millions of bones dealing apparel and accessories that live only in the metaverse. It might feel silly now, but the way you look online could start to matter a lot further if important of your work and play take place there. That’s why it’ll be important to keep track of how and why incorporations of different races and genders get priced online. The difference are formerly starting to show up, and the counteraccusations could be serious.

Remote Work to the Extreme: Telling someone that they demanded to prepare for the internet to disrupt their assiduity might have sounded portentous and indeed silly in 1990, but clearly not in retrospection. Is it possible that the same can be said for the metaverse?

The meta modus operandi could make remote work more endless and immersive. Facebook wants to bring its interpretation of the office to the virtual world, but so too does the big kahuna in plant technology Microsoft. A interpretation of Microsoft’s Brigades converse and conferencing program that features digital incorporations is in testing now and will be available in the first half of 2022. Guests will be suitable to partake Office lines and features, like PowerPoint balconies, in the virtual world.

Shifting Circumstances in the Real World: None of this is to say that the real world is going to vanish anytime soon. (Although occasionally it feels that way.) As cryptocurrency, gaming, work and everyday life combine, however, enterprises will continue to acclimatize in the real world.

One illustration We might start to see companies change locales to real- world authorities viewed as further friendly to the virtual bone. That formerly seems to be passing in Puerto Rico, whose low levies have been attracting the crypto crowd indroves.However, fine, If the metaverse’s bankers want to gather in San Juan. But I ’ll be cataloging interviews with them at the sand, not online.

Angel Vision,"(Makalenin Türkçe versiyonu)

I have been in the start-up sector for a long time with my Edimly start-up. I haven’t realized until today that we had provided no information about the vision and mission of our company on our website which I make all the marketing-related decisions on my own. Here, I will try to share my views about it.

The secret in us

Today, most of our actions are willingly or unwillingly recorded thanks to numerous devices around us. For example, a wearable technology product transfers how much we ran on the beach in the early hours of the morning and our heart rate to a digital world. But no one knows about the beautiful girl you saw when you ran on the beach and that tingly feeling that the morning sun created on that girl’s face. And think about listening to “Angel of The Morning” by Juice Newton from a streaming service like Spotify which turned all people into their target audience. Spotify probably noticed that you turned down the volume when you passed that girl but there is no such device to perceive our mood and transfer it to Spotify. It is a fact that all of these services which we register and send important or trivial information without noticing often use this data to show us ads. All they do is to show us what we have listened to the most at the end of the year and give us stupid pleasure. But at least they won’t know the pleasure we have, right? They might try to guess what we feel at that moment from our gestures but they will never know what is happening inside us ☺️

From Hello World to Big Data

I might have associated the company that address as “them” and the service the company provides. The vision is the targeted position of the company in the future while the mission is the steps taken to make that vision come true. Based on this definition, I don’t think it is wrong to say that “the mission of a company is the services it offers”. Then, we cannot deny the fact that these companies are willing to collect all the necessary and unnecessary data despite all the costs because of their vision to exploit us. In recent years, I frequently encounter people saying, “They are listening to us!” If only they knew that these companies are following us in various ways from the first days of the internet, they would understand that they do not see Cyprus ads because they are talking about Cyprus. It is not that hard to blend existing data with psychology and use artificial intelligence to make such recommendations. Although it is not commonly mentioned in recent years, Data Mining which is one of my main reasons to admire Google since I was a young boy is an extremely important branch. As someone who is curious about experiencing everything, I was able to do some interesting analysis as a kid by using the big data stolen from huge platforms (of course public data).

Hello New World?

I am unable to be included in the Metaverse trend which can be seen in the news of partisan media as someone who is curious about experiencing everything. But I have used both VR and AR glasses for a long time. If this hardware will enable us to access the Metaverse universe, it is not possible to predict that Metaverse will be a hit. When we all asked “is it sensible to pay 1 billion dollars” when Facebook acquired Instagram, we all witnessed that this platform worked out well years later. If an old man in Gönen can sell cheese today through a platform established only for sharing artistic pictures, that platform be a hit, man. But it is important to remember that the environment was suitable for Instagram to reach this power. When we look at the current conditions, Metaverse is weak in various terms and I don’t think it will be a hit unless it finds something innovative.

We are ruling this planet as humanity for a long time and there are even undiscovered places on the planet. For me, the only reason to create a new virtual environment despite such a large planet is commercial. This is nothing different than those who sold lands from other planets. Anyway… We still have a planet waiting to be discovered and a digital model designed with every detail. What bothers me is that for some reason, we use this map only to get directions to a location and to find out the location of our relatives.

Loneliness on the Map

On contrary to the Metaverse trend, I believe that we don’t need to create a new world yet. Instead of creating a new world, I would like to add color (🧡) to the existing world. I will try to explain how I will do that with an example. Let’s go back to our guy running on the beach as I have mentioned in the beginning. But this time, let’s assume he installs Edimly before starting the run. He opens Edimly and sees that the girl he encounters every day but is unable to speak is marked as “running”. He sends a request “shall we do it together” and they start walking together when the girl accepts. As you can see, we helped the love life of this young man. So, can we say that Edimly is a need? If we consider what Steve Jobs and similar entrepreneurs did until today, ABSOLUTELY! Edimly’s structure is suitable for everything. I don’t know if it will work if you want to sell refrigerators to the Eskimos. But I realize this one thing. When I open Google Maps and see myself alone, I feel like something is missing. I want to fill the maps with living beings breathing like us and acting like us instead of immovable assets like spaces. How clear can I be about Edimly’s vision and mission?",https://medium.com/@honortiger/angel-vision-e5e3ab435aed,['Onur Kaplan'],2022-01-16 14:55:11.902000+00:00,"['Vision', 'Marketing', 'Metaverse', 'Mission', 'Edimly']"
Top 5 most watched eSports events of 2021,"In terms of viewership, 2021 marked the year of breaking new records and taking eSports games to new levels of popularity.

Whether it’s traditional games steadily developing a fanbase or mobile cybersport continuing its growth, this year many cybersport tournaments attracted more than 1 million viewers — 22 events. Looking ahead to the end of 2021, we take a look at the top 5 most watched cybersport events (excluding the Chinese audience).

Most viewed events of 2021

5th place — The International 10 and PGL Major Stockholm 2021 (2.74m)

5th place went to 2 tournaments at once, from Valve in different disciplines.

Dota 2 — The International 10. The event was Dota 2’s most successful eSports event in the game’s history. The peak audience was 2.74 million viewers, who spent more than 107 million hours watching the tournament broadcasts. If to analyse which teams were popular at TI10, Team Spirit proved to be the most watched (in terms of average viewership). The Russian eSports team was watched by an average of 805,216 viewers. It was followed by PSG.LGD (767,762), Team Secret (561,481) and OG (517,908).

CS:GO — PGL Major Stockholm 2021. The first Major in two years did not disappoint viewers, becoming the most-watched tournament in the discipline. The peak viewership was 2.74 million. After VALORANT entered the eSports scene, many began to wonder, “what will happen to CS:GO?” But the huge interest in the game, during the PGL Major Stockholm 2021 tells us that CS:GO will definitely succeed.

4th place — M3 World Championship (3.19m)

The huge rise in popularity of mobile and the incredible success of the M3 World Championship, brought the game Mobile Legends: Bang Bang a peak of 3.19 million viewers. Fans spent 62.61 million hours watching the tournament. This result proves, not for the first time, that in the near future, mobile eSports will be able to completely push out PC eSports in terms of viewership.

3rd place — PUBG Mobile Global Championship Season 0 (3.8m)

Although PUBG Mobile Global Championship Season 0 started in November 2020, it made the list thanks to the fact that it finished and peaked in January 2021, recording an impressive 3.8 million viewers.

The average viewership of the game was 528,000 in 122 hours of broadcast. In terms of peak viewership, the tournament performed best in the Indonesian (2.12 million), Arabic (494,393) and Russian (415,412) regions.

2nd place — League of Legends 2021 World Championship (4.01m)

The 2021 League of Legends World Championship saw an incredible peak audience of 4.01 million viewers (excluding the Chinese audience). It is by far the most-watched tournament and the first eSports tournament to draw more than 4 million viewers.

The tournament also holds the record for the most hours watched in the history of eSports tournaments (174.82 million).

1st place — Free Fire World Series 2021 Singapore (5.41m)

The most watched cybersport event of 2021, is the Free Fire World Series 2021 Singapore. The mobile game garnered 5.41 million viewers at its peak and 2.08 million viewers on average in its short broadcast time.

Free Fire World Series 2021 Singapore is currently not only the most watched cybersport event of 2021 but also the most-watched ever.

It will be interesting to see if the mobile cybersport trend continues, or if PC games can compete for supremacy in 2022.",https://medium.com/@bigdjshadows/top-5-most-watched-esports-events-of-2021-17743a527ec5,['Silvester Johnson'],2022-01-04 17:09:04.107000+00:00,"['Esport', 'Top 5', 'Lol', 'Csgo', 'Dota 2']"
Treadmill vs Cycling: Which Is Better? Indian Arena,"When it comes to working out, people have a lot of different opinions on which is the best way to go. Some people swear by treadmill workouts, while others prefer cycling.

So, which is really better?

Let’s take a look at the pros and cons of each to find out!

Advantages of Treadmill

1. More comfortable

If you have a bad back, knees, hips or ankles, a running surface is probably going to be more comfortable for you than a seat on a stationary bicycle.

2. More variety

A treadmill is an open platform, so there’s usually more of a selection on what kind of running workouts you can do (interval training, hill training, etc.).

3. Preferred by elite athletes

Although both treadmill and cycling workouts are common among elite athletes, bicycling appears to be more popular among elite athletes.

This could be because you can hook up a treadmill to a video game console, while it’s hard to do that with a stationary bicycle.

4. Track your progress

Most treadmills come with a monitor that tracks your time, distance and calories burned.

5. Not as harsh on the knees

This might be marginal, but it is widely believed that running on a treadmill is less harsh on the joints than running outside.

6. Leave the machine behind

While this is obviously true for running, it can also be said for cycling. This means you won’t have to drive anywhere, and you can work out at your convenience.

Disadvantages of Treadmill

1. Not safe

Because the belt is running under your feet, there’s always the possibility of tripping or slipping on the treadmill if you need to get off quickly.

2. Less of a cardiovascular workout

Due to the fact that you’re not getting an elevated heart rate, workouts on a treadmill are typically not as good for burning fat.

3. Not as challenging

It’s easier to run on a treadmill than it is to ride a bike, making spinning your wheels much more challenging than running in place.

4. No scenery

If you’re using a treadmill, the only scenery you’ll be able to see is your own four walls. Riding a bicycle outside offers beautiful views and fresh air.

5. Not as motivating

Many runners like to be able to see the road and world around them while they workout, and if that isn’t possible on a treadmill it can take away from your motivation somewhat.

Thankfully, new technology has created televisions that go in front of treadmills, offering a way to view your favourite shows while you’re getting in shape.

Advantages of Cycling

Elevate your heart rate

Cycling is a great way to elevate your heart rate and burn fat.

2. Great for the cardiovascular system

Cycling is also a fantastic form of aerobic exercise, meaning it’s good for your heart and lungs.

3. A total body workout

Because cycling offers a variety of different exercises, you can work out every part of your body and still get a great cardiovascular workout.

4. Low impact

Because you’re on a saddle, cycling is easier on the joints than running is.

5. Great for people with injuries

If you have had an injury to your legs or hips, cycling may be a better way for you to exercise than running as it puts less pressure on those areas.

6. Leave the machine behind

If you’re a runner as well as a cyclist, this is obviously not going to apply to you, but for those who only cycle it’s true.

No need to go anywhere or hook up any equipment — just hop on your bicycle and off you go!

Since cycling can be more of a functional type of exercise, it’s also a good idea to invest in a bike that can easily be brought along with you on vacations or when visiting friends.

Disadvantages of Cycling

1. Harsh on the joints

Cycling is difficult on your knees and hips, especially if you’re going uphill. Running may not be easy for you, but it’s definitely less taxing on the joints than cycling is.

2. Less of a cardiovascular workout

You don’t get as elevated of a heart rate as you do when running which means that biking isn’t always as good for burning fat.

3. Harder to track your progress

Stationary bicycles and spin bikes will usually come with a monitor that tracks your time, distance and calories burned, but you won’t be able to do that if you’re outside or commuting on your bike.

What’s the best exercise to lose weight?

For those looking to lose weight, cycling and running are both great options.

Think of it this way: If you’re looking to lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you take in.

Since cycling requires no special equipment, you can simply ride your bike to burn calories. If you’re looking for resistance training, running is a good option as well since it includes strength training.

Both running and cycling are great total body workouts, so if you’re someone who is looking for a way to exercise every part of your body, you should try both and see which you like better.

If you only care about burning calories and losing weight, go for cycling since it’s a great form of aerobic exercise and targets your lower body.

If you’re looking to tone up and add strength training to your routine, running is a good option for you.

Conclusion — Which is Better?

As we can see from this article there are many advantages and disadvantages to both methods of exercise.

Treadmills would seem like the better option as it may be more effective at burning fat than cycling, but it is also much harder on the joints.

Cycling seems like the better option because it could be a more effective cardiovascular workout but it is also much harder on the joints.

It seems that both have their pros and cons, which is why it’s important to make a decision based on your personal goals, abilities and interests.",https://medium.com/@indianarena/treadmill-vs-cycling-which-is-better-indian-arena-1e52797f182d,['Indian Arena'],2022-01-01 09:36:26.189000+00:00,"['Treadmill', 'Cycling', 'Lose Weight Naturally', 'Home Workout']"
Cricket Star Manager: A P2E Game Built for 2.5 Billion People,"Cricket Star Manager

Over the past year, interest in play-to-earn (P2E) games has skyrocketed, powered by the explosive growth of cryptocurrency and NFTs. Games industry heavyweights, such as EA and Ubisoft believe P2E games are the future of gaming and with a gaming industry that is already worth upwards of $175 billion, combined with a P2E gaming market currently worth ~$32 billion and a crypto industry valued at ~$2.5 trillion… you’ve got yourself a genuine revolution in the way people play, earn, and connect.

A Cricket P2E Game?

Cricket is the predominant sport in over 17 countries including India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the United Kingdom and Australia. The total addressable population is over 2.5 billion followers across the globe, making it the world’s second most popular sport. Cricket is so popular that there has twice been over one billion people simultaneously watching the ICC Cricket World Cup, in 2015 and 2019.

The cricket industry has an annual valuation of ~$2 billion, with this figure increasing at a blistering pace with the further digitisation of sport and the reopening of the world, post-pandemic. The media rights for India’s IPL were recently valued at $5 billion for the next five-year cycle, a clear indication of the financial potential of the cricket industry.

The Cricket Star Manager team is composed of both gaming and blockchain industry veterans, including the founders of Gold Town Games. By tapping into the experience and success of their previous title, World Hockey Manager, with over two million downloads and over 100 million matches played, our team is creating a P2E game that will target a huge, overlooked niche and a massive fan base, while giving our users not just a great gaming experience but also the ability to earn real rewards for playing.

Introducing Cricket Star Manager

Cricket Star Manager is a fully featured sports management simulator, built on the Unity engine.

As a player in Cricket Star Manager, you create your own cricket team, starting in the lowest leagues alongside other beginners and just like in the real world, you can try to climb the divisions and compete for the highest title in your country. If you are successful in conquering your country, you can fight to be the number one cricket team in the world and enjoy all the spoils that come along with being the number one Cricket Star Manager!

Players stake and earn Cricket Buck ($CRIX) to participate in the game and when a cricket match is finished, $CRIX are split and distributed among the winning team, the stadium owner, and the spectators who supported the winning team. Using your winnings, you can draft new players to your roster, acquire legendary players/items and even a stadium to host games yourself.

Cricket Star Manager NFTs

Players

Each cricket player NFT on a team is different: speed, strength, stamina, and accuracy stats are all differentiators (the higher, the rarer), each generated as a NFT, which can level up, increasing their stats and abilities. When teams win matches, they win the game’s in-game currency which is used to evolve their players and team to higher levels (leveling up). Cricket player NFTs that reach a certain level can be bought and sold through the marketplace.

Once Cricket Star Manager is launched, player NFTs showing real cricket players will also be added to the game through licensing deals with leagues, clubs and individual players.

In learning from mistakes made in other NFT-games’ economies, specifically a constant inflation of game assets, Cricket Star Manager’s economy introduces elements of deflation (for example, retiring cricket players at a certain age etc.).

Stadiums

Skilled players in the game will have the opportunity to transform their basic cricket field into a stadium. Stadiums are issued as NFTs and owners can host games, tournaments, and special events, collecting fees from games played in their stadiums. A stadium can also be rented out to other players. Stadiums can also evolve over time, increasing their potential to host games and subsequently growing the player’s income.

When not hosting games, a player’s stadium is used for training the user’s cricket players, growing their experience during idle time thus increasing their skill and value.

Cricket Star Manager Tokens ($CSM and $CRIX)

Cricket Star Manager utilizes two tokens, $CSM and $CRIX.

$CSM is the premium and governance token with a fixed supply of 100 million. Token holders can stake $CSM to govern the community treasury, increase their asset values and affects how they earn these assets via gameplay. Owning $CSM opens access to exclusive NFT drops and sales. Early $CSM token holders will also receive $CRIX in the $CRIX Genesis drop.

$CRIX is the in-game currency and players earn $CRIX, by leveling up, winning matches, watching games etc. $CRIX can be spent to draft new players, train cricket players and speed up events, such as recovery from injuries. All transactions made in the P2P market will require $CRIX and users will be able to trade $CRIX for fiat currency through exchanges.

The Future of Cricket Star Manager

Considering the incredible potential of P2E games and the popularity of cricket around the world, Cricket Star Manager is poised to bring the best of both worlds. Not only will this game offer players an enjoyable and addictive gameplay experience, it also enables an additional, potentially life changing income stream for thousands of people in India, Bangladesh, and surrounding developing countries where cricket is massively popular.

The sports manager genre in the game industry is known for loyal players who can remain active for many years and by including P2E game mechanics, user retention will be multitudes higher as players can truly own their own teams…and receive all the benefits of doing so!

The team at Cricket Star Manager is determined to become one of the top 10 employers/income providers in India by 2023, and prove that gaming is much more than just a fun pastime.

More details about the game, public sale and timelines will be released soon. In the meantime we invite you to join us on this journey via our social channels listed below.

Top 10 Batsmen with Most Fifties in ODI cricket,"Over the years, the rise of the shortest format in cricket has almost added a necessity to still talk about the longer formats. However, the 50 over format (ODI) hasn’t lost its stature despite the prominence of shorter formats around the globe. The batsmen have been given more license and freedom, while the bowlers haven’t had many luxuries.

Modern-day cricket has evolved a lot, but there are still records that might be hard to break. One of those records will be to break into the batsmen list with most half-centuries in ODIs. A poor series might cost a batsmen’s career in the modern era. Let us look at the top 10 batsmen with the most half-centuries in ODI cricket.

Finasteride or Minoxidil or Both for Hair Loss?,"When it comes to Male Pattern Baldness (MPB) or Androgenetic Alopecia both Finasteride (Topical and Oral Finasteride) and Minoxidil works well. Finasteride blocks DHT which shrinks hair shaft and Minoxidil nourishes with increased blood supply as it dilates blood vessels.

All types of hair loss will benefit from Minoxidil. Finasteride will work only on male pattern baldness and not on other types of hair loss.

Consider Minoxidil as a general OTC hair treatment applied to the scalp while Finasteride pill and topical is used to treat androgenetic alopecia which is genetic and the most common cause of hair loss.

Minoxidil is only topical application for hair loss since oral ingestion can cause hair to grow all over the body. Oral minoxidil is prescribed for hypertension and not hair loss.

Finasteride blocks DHT, a potent form of testosterone that shrinks the hair shaft and makes it fall out eventually. Such hair loss starts in the 20s accelerating as one ages. So both oral finasteride and topical treatment is ok.

Side Effects of Minoxidil and Finasteride

Side effects of both finasteride and minoxidil tend to be extremely rare and highly manageable.

Minoxidil has to be used lifelong. Stopping minoxidil will revert hair loss. Finasteride can be stopped for a while without hair loss.

Finasteride might affect fertility,(watery sperm, spermatogenesis) it can be stopped for a period of time to improve sperm quality and resume after the child is conceived, without any hair loss.

Dosage — Finasteride and Minoxidil

Amount of topical finasteride is less than the oral finasteride. It is only .25mg, while oral finasteride — 1 mg./day. Those concerned about fertility issues can only use topical finasteride with minoxidil.

Topical finasteride is yet to be approved by FDA, but in the process. Many long term studies have proved that topical finasteride is extremely safe and beneficial for MPB hair loss.

The Fellowship Whitepaper,"What is the Fellowship?

Our goal is to create a community of the best builders, artists, community builders, defi-degens, and more in the Solana ecosystem.

This is not just a PFP project, and we do not aim to compete with other projects. The Fellowship’s logo consists of three interlocking rings known as Borromean rings. The three rings are strong together, yet fall apart if one is removed and signifies strength in unity. WAGAMI is our vibe, WAGAMI is our ethos. We will build together with all other Solana communities.

The Fellowship logo — Borromean Rings a symbol of strength in unity.

We aim to use the collective power of the Fellowship community, along with funds from the NFT sale, the Warchest, to build Web3 tooling that will accelerate the growth of the Solana NFT ecosystem.

The Fellowship community’s feedback will influence the Creator Machine roadmap and help our team decide which new platform features, partnerships and marketing we perform.

NFT Holders in addition to gaining access to the Fellowship community will receive a Launch Pass NFT with 1,000 Creator Machine credit. Creator Machine credits are used to pay for the usage of certain Creator Machine tools.

What is Creator Machine?

The Creator Machine team’s mission is to empower creators and community builders to achieve financial independence via the power of NFTs, DAOs, and other Web3 technologies.

We believe these new technologies enable creators and community builders the opportunity to organize groups of people and capital in an innovative manner, and that we’ve only just breached the surface of what’s possible.

The first version of Creator Machine is a software platform that allows anyone to launch a Solana NFT project without a single line of code.

The Creator Machine team aims to continue developing no-code software that enables anyone regardless of their technical ability the opportunity to both launch their own Solana NFT project and manage an NFT-gated community.

Creator Machine aims to open-source portions of our software to the Solana community to ensure we provide a maximum positive impact to Solana.

Ideas for future Creator Machine features

The targeted functionalities of Creator Machine at launch will allow all users to generate NFT art, Solana metadata, launch a Candy Machine mint process, and create a mint web page, all without a line of code.

However, this is just the beginning. We plan to gather feedback from the Fellowship community to help guide our roadmap. We are not sure which direction the community and the market will take us, but some ideas we’ve already received include:

Airdrops — send an NFT airdrop to one or 10,000 community members in just a few clicks. Discord & Twitter Salesbot — set up a bot to record the sales of your NFT on Discord and Twitter. Whitelisting for NFT drops — create a presale that is only available to a list of wallets that you’ve defined Credit Card purchase of NFTs — allow buyers to purchase your NFT using a credit card Social Token creation and distribution — launch your own social/meme token for your project. NFT Gated Community Forums & Websites — create a website that only your token holders can access. Discord is great, but there exists an opportunity for new ways of communication and organization. Project treasury management & multi-signature wallets — projects are run by multiple team members, and you want to ensure that funds earned from your NFT project are properly managed with multiple team members. Our goal is to reduce the risk of rugs.

To be clear, these are ideas, not a promise. We are not sure what direction the community and the market will take us. As we onboard this community to Creator Machine, it is very likely we may discover new ideas that have not even been thought of yet.

Who is the Creator Machine / Fellowship team?

We’re a doxxed team with 20+ years of experience developing software at companies like Microsoft, Boeing, Bridg, and ProducePay.

We’re members of the Monkedao, Thugdao, Pesky Penguins, Shadowy Super Coder DAO, Catalina Whales, and more. We’ve contributed code to the Metaplex codebase and intend to continue to contribute to the Solana ecosystem.

We’re a battle-tested team, and our NFT launch skills have already been tested on many projects such as Joylina’s Cantina, Skollz, Graceful and more. We’re also partnering up with Solana influencer Rick Bakas on his upcoming Pin Club launch.

Product & Marketing

What utility will Fellowship OG NFT holders get?

Access to the Fellowship community Discord.

Early access to the Creator Machine platform ahead of the general public. Fellowship NFT holders will get platform access before we open the platform up to the tool to non- Fellowship NFT holders.

For each Fellowship OG NFT that you purchase, you will receive two Fellowship Launch Pass NFTs which carry with them 1,000 Creator Machine platform credits. The first Launch Pass NFT will be airdropped to Fellowship OG NFT holders about three to four weeks post the initial Fellowship NFT sale, around Feb 28th-Mar 5th. The second Launch Pass will be airdropped to those who hole the Fellowship OG NFT between Aug 7th–13th, 2022. If you need platform access ahead of the airdrop, we can open it up to project teams upon request.

One Creator Machine platform credit = 1 free NFT created via the Creator Machine platform. Launching a project with 10,000 NFTs will cost 10,000 Creator Machine credits. Users will only pay rent fees that are required to interact with the Solana protocol.

NFT holders get unlimited use of the Creator Machine generative art and metadata generation tool. Our tool allows you to take art layers and create thousands of unique NFTs. You’ll also get metadata files that enable you to seamlessly set up your NFT launch with the Candy Machine and in the Creator Machine platform.

The Warchest: How will the primary sale and royalty funds be used?

The proceeds, net of taxes, will be used to build the Creator Machine team and fund the development of new platform features, platform marketing, and more. This will enable the founding team to quit their day jobs and be able to focus 100% of their time on Creator Machine and the Fellowship.

Fellowship Launch Passes

Fellowship Launch Pass NFTs which carry with them 1,000 Creator Machine platform credits.

One Creator Machine platform credit = 1 free NFT created via the Creator Machine platform. Launching a project with 10,000 NFTs will cost 10,000 Creator Machine credits. Users will only pay rent fees that are required to interact with the Solana protocol.

A project launching a 6,000 NFT project will only need to purchase three Fellowship OG NFTs. That’s just 6 SOL to launch your collection. And Creator Machine credits enable you to launch without giving any cut of your primary sales or royalties to the Creator Machine platform.

If you compare that cost to the 20–50% of primary sales and royalties that other launchpads charge, you’re getting a serious deal by purchasing the Fellowship OG NFT.

The first Launch Pass NFT will be airdropped to Fellowship OG NFT holders about three to four weeks post the initial Fellowship NFT sale, around Feb 28th-Mar 5th. The second Launch Pass will be airdropped to those who hole the Fellowship OG NFT between Aug 7th–13th, 2022. If you need platform access ahead of the date Launch Passes are distributed, we are happy to grant you access upon request.

You will then be able to log in to your Creator Machine account, attach the Launch Pass NFT to your account, and redeem your 1,000 Creator Machine platform credits. You can use one credit or 1,000 at once, that is up to you. Once applied and added to your Creator Machine account you own the credits for life.

If you are a Creator with a project that needs to launch ahead of the Launch Pass NFT drop date, please complete our Creator Whitelist Application. We already have some exciting launches planned in the weeks after the Fellowship NFT drop.

Top 5 NFT Marketplace Development Companies — Crypto Reaper of the NFT era,"What is NFT?

A Non-Fungible Token is a computerized resource that mainly addresses web collectibles like art, music, and games with a valid testament made by the blockchain technology, and it is considered totally safe and secure.

NFT stamping can likewise fill in as an answer for raising assets by empowering people to tokenize and closeout advanced manifestations like film and writing, computerized collectibles, just as reports like an agreement and licenses.

Generally, NFT trades occur in digital currencies, for instance, Bitcoin in expert locales. A noteworthy example of a non-fungible token is Cryptopunks. It empowers the user to purchase, sell, and store thousands of collectibles with evidence of possession.

The major idea in this term is non-fungible. To call something fungible is to infer that you can supplant it with another distinguishable and accessible thing of similar worth. In other words, a non-fungible thing is something that cannot be changed or replaced with another comparable thing.

NFT Marketplace

The NFT Marketplace is a scattered stage that is solely used to trade non-fungible tokens. NFT stages need purchases and merchants to have crypto wallets for executing exchanges. The NFT tokens are sold at a fixed cost or through a sell-off.

Top 5 NFT Marketplace Development Companies

The recent advancement of the non-fungible token marketplace is normally done by blooming associations and organizations with broad skills, and their ventures are viewed as more dependable. Here is a list of some of the best NFT marketplace development companies:

The Process of Buying & Selling NFTs

To utilize a commercial center or a marketplace, one should enlist and associate the crypto wallet with his/her record. Here are a few steps are given below for one to clearly understand the process of buying and selling NFT:

Make an NFT and characterize every favored boundary.

List the advanced products available to be purchased and sit tight for the completion of the entire procedure.

Then purchasers put their offers in when the closeouts or auctions happen on the web portal.

When closeouts are finished, the marketplace exchanges cryptocurrencies and computerized items that are fed into the site.

These conventions control the associations between the seller and the purchaser from the very beginning of the transaction. Also, these smart contracts contain distinguishing information related to NFT. Thus, the method involved with trading tokens becomes easy to understand and is considered helpful for users.

Making an NFT Marketplace with the Assistance of Blockchain Experts

NFT Marketplace Development intends to produce a decentralized stage over the blockchain to exchange NFT tokens. The NFT tokens are made for different businesses like art, music, agriculture, and so on. The NFT tokens are exchanged among the purchasers and dealers in the trustworthy marketplace.

In the latest trends, NFT tokens are developing quickly and have become huge among computerized resources. They have a value of one million dollars, and the absolute count of dynamic wallets performing NFT exchanges expanded on a high note in 2021.",https://medium.com/geekculture/top-5-nft-marketplace-development-companies-crypto-reaper-of-the-nft-era-1d5fe1256377,['Linda John'],2022-01-17 13:30:41.197000+00:00,"['Nft Marketplace Platform', 'Nft Collectibles', 'Nft', 'Nft Marketplace']"
Horse Power: The New Passive Income of NFTs.,"This is Stallion, creator and visionary of Horse Power.

You can buy HorsePower NFTs here starting January 1st.

Stay updated + reward drops here in the telegram chat.

I am here to make sure that your HorsePower (HP) NFT:

Goes up in value. Gets you passive income for the rest of your time holding it.

How is this possible?

With the invention of Defi (Decentralized Finance) and new multi-chain products available, earning safe passive income in no longer a dream, but reality.

I will take the crypto invested into the HorsePower NFTs and grow it through a variety of different protocols and then send back large amounts to the holders.

The more HorsePower you have, the more you make.

What if I don’t pay you? Well, i’m sure a-lot of you bought a bunch of NFTs that didn’t benefit you in any way because nobody bought them after you did. Worse case scenario you would loose $250 worth of money. Best case scenario, you become a millionaire from holding long enough.

HorsePower NFTs will have 10 Generations.

The First Generation is the liquidity funding. The first three-hundred hp nfts will cost $250. (Down from $500)

Each HP NFT is unique.

WAGMI = We All Going To Make It

Generation 1 will consist of 1000 HP NFTs. Daily rewards will start beginning with the full sale of 300 HP NFTs. The following 700 will be integrated into for sale at a price of $500.

Each generation will have different attributes, twists, and even an automated process of receiving rewards in the future.

Rewards are as follows:

Daily Reward — This will range from $100–500 to any random holder or a variation of it. (Eg: $100 to five different holders) Weekly Price — This is a prize from $500–$1000 to any random holder. Monthly Jackpot — Any amount depending on the market and how generous I am feeling.

*All these are subject to higher increases, or lower depending on the market.

Through this new combination of Crypto + NFTs, we really are all going to make it.

HP NFTs are available on NFTrade starting January 1st.

The benefits of the “MintDAO chests.”,"Our first NFT collection is approaching soon, so we are happy to share with you some insight details regarding their actual value!

What are the benefits :

Each chest will function based on yield farming and extract $MINT tokens for its owner. Our farming will run for three weeks from purchasing the crate, and on top of it, farming of $MINT tokens will be ahead of TGE.

So, that means buying a MintDAO chest is a form of ensuring participation in the PUBLIC SALE of the project.

Power :

All chests will have their “power” from the highest 2000 to 1000. The energy, however, shows the speed of farming, so in the simple words :

2000 — the fastest one

1000 — the slowest

We are offering the following 1000 MintDAO chests. You have :

• 10% chance to get legendary chests (power 1901–2000)

• 30% chance to get rare chests (power 1601–1900)

• 60% chance to get uncommon chests (power 1001–1600)

Whitelist :

Minting our first NFT will consist of two phases, where phase one will be whitelisted mint.

If your wallet is whitelisted, you will be able to purchase NFT during the first two hours before the public stage, and you are guaranteed to draw a legendary or rare chest.

The Future :

When the Box Farming Event finishes, the MintDAO chests will remain the first-ever MintDAO collection. The MintDAO chests can be listed and sold on a marketplace like any other NFT.

Is it worth selling?

In this case, the decision is all yours… However, keep in mind that there is a possibility of using these chests again in future events!

Building a Gamified NFT Ecosystem,"PHASE 2: BUILDING USE CASE FOR $CLUB

MiniVerse Breeding Game

The MiniFrens Generations Collection will be the only breedable collection in the GameFi ecosystem after the land mint. MiniFrens Generations will have a hard capped supply at 8076 and 4 different generations. This will bring the total supply of MiniVerse NFTs to 10,000 + Land (max 200). We will also be adding new Mini animals to each generation. The possibilities are endless think about MiniTigers or MiniLions and much more!

MiniFrens Generations Breeding Breakdown

Gen 1: #1–#1924 250 $CLUB Mint Gen 2: #1925–#3848 500 $CLUB Mint Gen 3: #3849–#5772 750 $CLUB Mint Gen 4: #5773–#8076 1000 $CLUB Mint

How does the breeding work?

You will need any 2 MiniVerse NFT’s in your wallet to breed. You will then pick 1 of your MiniVerse NFT’s to “breed”. This is basically blacklisting one of your NFT’s from breeding again for the season. It will cost 250–1000 $CLUB depending on which generation we are in the game. You can still use the “bred” NFT’s to breed other MiniVerse NFT’s because you need 2 in your wallet to breed 1. There will be seasons that last a number of days/weeks. There will be multiple seasons each generation and every MiniVerse NFT that has “bred” will be reset each season allowing them to “breed” again. This allows for a dynamic breeding game where players have to make choices and manage their $CLUB to maximize their mints each season. Players will choose to !stake or !breed for the season and combined with the tax system it creates game theory and choices for the player. Each season will have a set number of rare 1/1 MiniFrens that players will have to a chance to breed. There will be holiday/event themed MiniFrens in certain seasons as well.

Incubation Periods

When you breed a MiniFrens Generation it will be hidden. This is to protect the breeding games NFT metadata from being sniped. Approximately every week a snapshot will be taken of newly bred hidden MiniFrens and they will be revealed.

Where does the $CLUB go from breeding cost?

70% gets burned. 20% goes to landowners. 10% goes back to staking contract.

Possible Wolf Game Like Stealing Mechanic

We are looking into adding Chainlink integration that will allow us to create randomness in the breeding contract. We could use this to add a “wolf game like” stealing mechanic where newly bred MiniFrens have a chance to be stolen by landowners. This will mainly be determined if Chainlink VRF comes out for Fantom in time.

Fantom NFT Blue Chip Slot Machine/Promotion Launchpad

We are going to create the first web-based slot machine with NFT rewards on Fantom. Rewarding both blue chip and newly minting NFT’s on Fantom. This will be one of the flag ship products in the MiniVerse GameFi ecosystem we hope it attracts users from all around the Fantom community!

How will the slot machine work?

We are still developing the tokenomics behind the slot machine to make it sustainable. But you will need $CLUB to spin that's guaranteed.

What Fantom Blue Chip NFT’s can we win?

Ancestral Umans, 8bit Netizens, Cyber Nekos, Beardies, Bitkittens, Magicats. We hope that people from the FTM blue chip communities come and try to win! We will also vote on other FTM NFT’s to add.

Slot Machine Promotion Launchpad

We will form partnerships with newly minting FTM projects to add free mints/whitelists of their projects to our slot machine as minor jackpots. This will be beneficial for newly minting projects looking for help with promotion.

How will you fund and make the slot machine sustainable?

We are still deciding the tokenomics behind the slot machine but there will be some portion of the spin cost that goes to buying more NFT’s to load up the slot machine. We also have our development treasury as a defi treasury which is currently farming in TOMB finance ($TOMB/$FTM) giving our treasury a positive inflow of funds with minimal risk of impermanent loss. We are taking no cut from the MiniChillas mint at its all going into the $TOMB/$FTM LP for the further development.

A Web3 Integrated MiniGame

We plan to build a web3 integrated MiniGame where players need to be holding MiniVerse NFT’s to play. We will run special competitions in this game where players will be able to win $CLUB and will have an on-chain leaderboard where users will have to sign with meta-mask to submit their scores.

What is the game going to be?

We have many options, but it will be a simple web-based game. Examples, flappy birds, doodle jump, crossy road. But we will integrate MiniVerse NFT’s into the game.",https://medium.com/@miniverseclub/miniverse-roadmap-2022-edf2baf1ae9d,[],2022-01-14 22:30:19.777000+00:00,"['Gamefi', 'Nft Collectibles', 'Playtoearn', 'Miniverse', 'Nft']"

What We Might Learn From the Controversy Surrounding NFTs for Artists,"By Mix.Mag

As both a music enthusiast and someone who works in tech, it’s fascinating to witness various artists either release NFTs or voice their opinions on why they refuse to ever. Though I happen to be quite bullish on web3 and all that it might do for the music industry, from enabling better fan engagement to securitizing IP to allowing artists (and fans) to cash in on their ability to be great tastemakers, the controversy surrounding NFTs is neither unsurprising nor unwarranted. I do believe that there is much to learn from creators’ unease towards these things, as we attempt to ensure that the “new” music industry, powered by web3, is not only ambitious but rightfully so.

For some artists, an NFT release seems like a natural extension of their brand and thus may not elicit the kind of growing pains expected during the initial phases of any sort of tech adoption. I’d like to think of these artists as the early adopters.

In beginning with the mainstream (or those with hefty followings), artists like 3LAU and deadmau5 come to mind, both of whose brands are pivotally centered around technology itself. First and foremost, the art that each creates is powered by music technology in some of its rawest forms (i.e., a focus on synthesizers as opposed to other instruments, a propensity towards quantizing everything and eliminating much of a human feel, etc.)

Beyond that, tech as an ~idea~ bolsters the stage personas of these artist types; this includes the visualizations used during live performance, album art, and more. Therefore, it is no surprise that in addition to releasing NFT songs and collections, many of these “early adopters” are riding the waves that allow us to envision a future of the music industry in which web3 plays a major part. With deadmau5’s involvement in numerous VC-backed metaverse projects and even joining venture, in addition to 3LAU’s Royal which last raised a $55mm Series A led by a16z, these folks, in addition to others in a similar sphere, leverage and adopt web3-powered music technology seamlessly. With that, however, they seem to be driving everyone else towards a music industry that many artists don’t seem quite ready for.

Two artists, which happen to be amongst my favorites, illustrated this industrywide polarization back in March. Lane 8 tweeted that he would not be releasing NFTs nor would he be “pandering to the ultra rich” — rather, he’d release his music “the normal way.” Rufus Du Sol replied to this tweet:

Then came some child’s play, like Dillon Francis minting Lane 8’s initial tweet as an NFT, but that’s not worth getting far into. Now, what’s interesting about this particular example is that we’re discussing two artists who operate within a very particular niche of alternative house / electronic music — their fanbases, I presume, are uniquely shared. It’s not unlikely that their shared fanbase was left confused about how to perceive NFTs following this dispute, which therefore puts a significant damper on visions of a world in which artists can be compensated via this type of asset. I think that this is objectively bad.

So let’s break down a few of the most likely concerns implicated within Lane 8’s initial tweet, which seem to need industrywide addressing for the marriage between web3 and music to have any hope:

NFTs are bad for the environment

2. They’re conducive to scams

3. They’re pointless

The first two points here require only brief addressing — the nascent market for NFTs means that we just haven’t quite yet figured out all of the logistics. Environmental concerns surrounding minting NFTs and crypto are not new, as these concerns have driven the Ethereum blockchain to declare that they’d switch to proof-of-stake vs. proof-of-work block production. There are necessary improvements to come, though it should not be ignored that producing nearly anything that a fan might buy doesn’t exactly come energy-free. In terms of the scams associated with NFTs, the market’s unregulated IP environment, mixed with its speculative nature and a particular class of eager consumers, has caused tokens like Squid Game and influencer-pushed SaveTheKids to disappoint and establish less faith in a market with already-wavering uncertainty.

The last point, however, that NFTs are pointless is worth spending significant time on. The production logistics could be there — NFTs could be carbon negative — but if the product itself is pointless? Well, then, let’s not waste our time.

In stripping away any notion of web3 for web3’s sake, what’s left? The value proposition is either pure ownership of something worth owning (one of a kind or not and static or not), or it’s the potential cash flows associated with the future value of the digital asset (what Royal.io is aiming to accomplish). The “point” of the latter seems self explanatory —as a fan, I feel that I am being appropriately compensated for my taste in music and my propensity to tell my friends to stream this music.

But ownership as it relates to NFTs that artists might release as strictly collectibles (excluding IP rights here) is more nuanced. What’s the point? There doesn’t seem to really be one, or one worth selling to those who are not accustomed to “just enjoying” a stamp collection in the solitude of their basements (aka the majority). I believe that collectible digital assets (in the form of audio or otherwise) which disclude IP ownership and its associated positive financial implications do have a place in this world. But if so, very few industry players seem to be focused on true value creation here.

Utility is subjective, but there are certain things that people generally agree are useful — personalized content, 1–1 interactions with the people we look up to (artists), access to likeminded communities, etc. NFTs as collectibles have the potential to unlock these things that really mean something to fans and that fans are willing to pay for.

The true exclusivity factor of NFTs as collectibles is an interesting topic of debate, as the creation of often false scarcity is off-putting to fans and artists who view these things as tools for “pandering to the ultra-wealthy.” I will not dive deeply into this here, however it’s important to note that time and energy is scarce — there are human limitations to just how much good content an artist might release via their NFT-locked Discord server, etc.

I’ve seen companies which make NFT release processes easier for artists or NFT exchanges between fans swifter and better. But I’ve only seen a few companies focused around strictly the utility piece of the NFT — or stop and truly think about why it might be valuable to create this sort of collectible / undergo this endeavor anyway.

I believe that there are incredible opportunities here — but players in the ecosystem (artists, fans, founders, and VCs) must have open conversations and address many of these (warranted) concerns. Only then might we reach an industry-wide consensus on what is and isn’t worth minting and subsequently enable better ways for artists to be appropriately compensated for their work.",https://medium.com/@julietterolnick/what-we-might-learn-from-the-controversy-surrounding-nfts-for-artists-3f354de93e9e,['Juliette Rolnick'],2022-01-05 05:26:33.112000+00:00,"['Music Industry', 'Nft Collectibles', 'Music', 'Nfts', 'Creator Economy']"
A Look at the PUNKS Comic NFT,"This is an excerpt of my bi-weekly newsletter. Read the whole thing, sub here!

One of the first NFT comics in the market (Matt Kindt made the first one, and that was an actual 1:1 NFT comic) — but PUNKS by Pixel Vault is definitely the most famous one, and is not just purely a comic book but a whole ecosystem.

ICYMI: a great recap of the Punks NFT history is here by NFT NOW.

TL:DR version:

Pixel Vault, a company that owns 16 CryptoPunks (the floor as of this writing is 53 ETH) decided instead of leaving them in a wallet doing nothing, gave these NFTs personalities and characters and thus the PUNKS comic was born.

Went live in May 2021 for .2ETH and with 10,000 copes of the first issue of Punks.

If you held, and you were one of the first 5000 holders — you would get Punks #2 for free (available in December 2021).

It gets complicated from here — but owners could HOLD, BURN or STAKE their comic for rewards — so it’s become more of a rewards game than actual comic publishing project.

I didn’t get the Punks comic NFT, too slow on the mint and too expensive now, but I found the comic via a friendly NFT holder and read it to get an idea of what they were doing. And you might be surprised to learn that the comic is the least interesting thing about the Punks comic.

What’s it about? “a comic that chronicles Beanie’s journey — from humble auction house busboy to digital art kingpin — to capitalize on the digital revolution in the Metaverse (enduring kidnappings, clowns, anons, and the mysterious Elvis Punksley, all as part of his quest). The story pays homage to NFT influencer Beanie’s obsession with Robbie Barrat’s work, while bringing CryptoPunks to life in a whimsical and creative way.”

After reading it, it feels like the Adult Swim show The Venture Brothers crossed with Lock Stock and Barrel but about crypto. It’s a very slick indie comic and I’m sure there are a lot of inside jokes here from Beanie’s life and his friends.

It’s written by Richard Galbraith with art by Australian Chris Wahl who has drawn Tank Girl and done commercial work for Marvel, DC and Hasbro.

Apparently the comic will see print and made available to those that still own the NFT and did not burn it. What is the value on the paper version as opposed to the NFT remains to be seen but you can see the allure for people that didn’t get the NFT to at least get the comic itself.

I feel the comic is just the starting point and the Tokenomics is the real mission on fractional ownership of a bunch of CryptoPunks. It makes my head hurt to understand all this, but wow what a long way to go to basically create a new DAO.

To try and sum it up, this first issue is tied to ownership of EITHER:

50% of the 16 CryptoPunks represented by $PUNKS token holders.

OR

Partnership in the Founder’s DAO, composed of 25% of the 16 CryptoPunks represented by $PUNKS token holders PLUS collective ownership of the other works in the Founder’s DAO.

The interesting note is that Pixel Vault will create and sell PUNKS Merchandise, with the profits (100%) of which will be distributed to $PUNKS Token holders. The second issue of Punks is out now.

You can track all of it here.

UPDATE: January 2, 2022

I got a hold of PUNKS #2 and so here are a few pages from it featuring the Bored Apes that will lead into my next post on the Adidas crossover with Punks.

Generate NFT Images and Metadata in Bulk With Python,"Generate NFT Images and Metadata in Bulk With Python

When I wrote the first article, I was just exploring the process of generating NFT images. As I learned more, I realized it’s not just about generating images, but also generating metadata, as well as storing the images in the cloud. You can think of this article as an improved version of the first article. Also, after writing this article and learning more, I went ahead and built a small website using the same concept to let users generate their collection. For now, I have limited it to 1000 images, but hoping to continue to work on it if there are enough visits. Please do check it out!

This code has some improvements compared to the previous one. The main ones are as follow:

The user can add as many layers as they want, the only thing they have to specify in the code is the name of the layers.

The number of variations in each layer doesn’t have to be the same, the code will just load a list of files in each folder representing a layer using them.

The code also generates a .json file containing the metadata of the image generated.

Once again, I am not a professional programmer and my code will likely not be the best way to accomplish a task but hey, it works!

Directory Structure:

The following image shows the directory structure:

The directory structure for our code

The root folder contains subfolders, with each representing a layer. Each subfolder representing a layer has to be numbered in the sequence they want the layers to be picked and merged. So the lowest layer of the image, which is the background, will be named as “1”, the next layer “2”, and so on. In an image with 5 layers, the background would be 1 and the topmost layer would be 5.

Each layer subfolder contains image files representing each variation of that layer. They don’t have to be numbered as our updated code loads the filenames. However, you should name each file appropriately as this name will be used in the metadata of the image file generated.

Storing Images in The Cloud:

All the images in your NFT collection will have to be stored somewhere. You can choose to store it anywhere you want but keep in mind you have to make sure that it’s reliable storage so that your pictures are accessible at any time. A popular option is Pinata. Pinata stores your data in a peer-to-peer file system known as Inter-Planetary File System. Pinata is pretty straightforward. You can register for free storage for up to 1 GB. Once you are logged in, upload a folder. Any folder with a test file would do. The point at this stage is to get a URL address that you can use in your metadata file. Once you have uploaded the folder, go back to the home page, you will see your folder name there. Next to it, you will see it’s CID, which is a long sequence of alphabets and numbers. Copy that and save it at a location you can access easily as we will need it for our code.

Setting Parameters:

Let’s define some parameters.

#Name of your project, using test for now.

project = ‘test’ #The CID of the folder on Pinata.

url = ‘QtgdsX3fsfT45fsggrd’ #The local folder which will have the layers' subfolders.

folder = ‘layers’ #The number of images you want to generate.

count = ‘100’ #List containing the names of the layers, in the sequence you want

#the layers to be picked by the code and merged. layers_names = [“background”, “face”, “shirt”, “accessory”]

The total count of the images that could possibly be generated can be calculated by multiplying the number of files in each layer’s subfolder. Let’s say we have 4 layers and each layer has 4 variations represented by files, the total number of possible unique images would be:

4x4x4x4=256

Adding more layers would increase the count exponentially. However, for testing, you may not want to generate that many images as it will take a lot of time so can set it to 100 or even 10.

Importing Necessary Libraries:

import random

import os

from itertools import product

from PIL import Image

Generating all possible combinations of the variation files:

Now we will load a list of files in each subfolder in our folder specified by the folder parameter. We will then combine them in all possible combinations to generate a list of tuples, each tuple containing a possible combination of a variation of each layer. This can be accomplished by one line of code.

combinations = list(product(*[os.listdir(f'{folder}/{x}') for x in os.listdir(folder)]))

Each item in this list represents a possible combination of variations in each layer. We will use it to load the files based on their filenames and merge them. In case you don’t want to go all the way and have limited the number of images to a smaller number it might be a good idea to shuffle this list.

random.shuffle(combinations)

Generating The Images and Metadata:

The following code iterates through each combination in the combinations list, loads an image from each layer folder and merges them into one image, then saves it and also generates the metadata for that image and saves that too.

c=0

metadata={} for combination in combinations:

if c != count:

if len(combination)>2:

comp = image.alpha_composite(image.open(f'{folder}/1/{combination[1]}').convert('RGBA'),

image.open(f'{folder}/2/{combination[2]}').convert('RGBA'))

n=3

for item in combination[2:]:

if combination.index(item)!=-1:

comp = Image.alpha_composite(comp,

image.open(f'{folder}/{n}/{item}').convert('RGBA'))

n+=1

rgb_im = comp.convert('RGB')

file_name = str(combinations.index(combination)) + "".png""

rgb_im.save(""./images/"" + file_name)

metadata['image']=f'{image_url}/{file_name}'

metadata['tokenId']=str(combinations.index(combination))

metadata['name']=project+' '+str(combinations.index(combination))

metadata['attributes']=[]

for item in layers_names:

metadata['attributes'].append({item:combination[layers_names.index(item)][:-4]})

with open(f""./metadata/{str(combinations.index(combination))}.json"", ""w"") as outfile:

json.dump(metadata, outfile, indent=4)

c+=1

else:

break

The variable “c” keeps a count of how many files have been generated and is updated at the end of each iteration. For each item in the “combinations” list, the code first checks the value of “c”, if it is not equal to the “count” variable, it will proceed otherwise it will break the loop.

For the first two layers, I had to hard code their paths, I am sure there is a better way of doing this, but I could not figure it out. Beyond the first two layers, other layers are loaded one by one and merged with the previously merged layers.

The index of each item in the “combinations” list is used as a file name for both the image file and the json file. We need the “layers_names” list for the metadata. Each item in that list represents the attribute of the image, the value of which is the filename of the file representing that variation in its respective layer. Therefore, each variation in every layer’s folder should be named appropriately as it will go on the metadata. Images are saved in the “images” folder and metadata files are saved in the “metadata” folder.

The code will likely not be displayed with the appropriate indentation therefore feel free to check out the Jupyter notebook. As stated earlier, my code may be juvenile but I am here to learn and your feedback will certainly help me improve. Thank you for reading this far! As I go through my project, I will share what I learn.

How NFTs became a $40bn market in 2021,"At the beginning of 2021, only a niche group of crypto enthusiasts knew what non-fungible tokens (NFT) were.

But by the end of the year nearly $41bn had been spent on NFTs, according to the latest data, making the market for digital artwork and collectibles almost as valuable as the global art market.

“This year witnessed the NFT market explode from a sub-billion-dollar market to a multi-decabillion industry,” said Mason Nystrom, research analyst at crypto data group Messari, adding that buyers were rushing to uncover art that aligns with their “digital identities”.

NFTs are essentially digital ownership certificates registered on a blockchain — an immutable record that cannot be changed or tampered with.

The tokens are typically created or minted using smart contracts — self-executing contracts written into the code of a blockchain — and can be traded on the secondary market in exchange for cryptocurrency.

NFT mania hit the mainstream in March, when a collage by the artist Beeple sold for $69.3m at Christie’s, in the first sale of its kind at the auction house. The artist, whose given name is Mike Winkelmann, reacted with a tweet: “holy fuck”.

Recommended

Though first popularised in the art world, corporate players from sports and music — even former US first lady Melania Trump — have also embraced the concept to cash in on the hype and find new ways to engage with fans.

The NBA, the US basketball league, created its own NFT marketplace for buying, selling and trading video highlights of its players called NBA Top Shot.

Other hits included numbered collections of NFTs that went viral, including CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club, and which denoted the clubby status of their owners and are used as avatars on social media profiles.

“The core value is still exclusivity,” said Nystrom, noting that expensive collections also offer purchasers access to gated channels on chat platform Discord, and to meetups and parties.

“They are country club-esque: there is a high barrier to entry — a capital cost — and you are around high net worth and other individuals,” he added.

In total, $40.9bn was poured into the ethereum blockchain contracts that are typically used to create NFTs in the year to December 15, according to Chainalysis, a crypto analytics group. The total would even be higher if it included NFTs minted on other blockchains, such as solana.

By comparison, last year the global art market was worth $50.1bn, according to figures from UBS and Art Basel.

Chainalysis found that NFTs have introduced a huge number of retail investors to the crypto world, with small transactions of under $10,000 accounting for more than 75 per cent of the market.

But much like the market for cryptocurrencies, it remains dominated by a few large players, or “whales”.

Between late February and November, there were 360,000 NFT owners holding 2.7m NFTs between them. Of those, about 9 per cent — or 32,400 wallets — held 80 per cent of the value of the market, Chainalysis found.

Stephen Diehl, a crypto-sceptic software engineer, said many whales are “sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars of crypto” from the boom in crypto prices, “looking to turn their crypto into more crypto”.

Others say they approach the market as professional traders-cum-collectors. One well-known NFT investor, known as Pranksy on Twitter, who started out with an initial investment of $600 in 2017 now has an NFT portfolio worth more than $20m, they said.

They told the Financial Times that they invest in a mix of projects, “some of which have a higher daily trading volume and others that have a more niche appeal”. Aside from “flipping” lucrative projects, Pranksy said they had “specific pieces I plan to keep as long term investments”.

So far, most new NFT collectors on the secondary market have yet to recoup the costs of their purchases, according to an analysis for the FT by blockchain analysis platform Nansen, where early collectors have benefited from a rise in the price of the NFTs as well as in the cryptocurrency used to trade in them.

The unregulated space is also plagued by fraud, scams and market manipulation, especially because the real-world identities of buyers and sellers is difficult, if not impossible, to discover.

Analysis by Nansen found $2m of suspect activity across the CryptoPunk and Bored Ape collections in the 30 days to mid-December. Some NFTs, for example, were sold at a 95 per cent discount to the average sale price, either because of mistakes by buyers and sellers, tax write-offs or some other scam exploiting unskilled users.

Researchers have also warned that the market is likely being inflated by wash trading — when a trader takes both sides of a trade in order to give the false impression of demand.

“You can buy and sell an NFT on a public platform and make it look like there is plenty of interest in the piece when it’s just you pushing up the price,” said Rüdiger K Weng, chief executive of Germany-based Weng Fine Art.

“This happens in the traditional art world too”, he said, but added that if a manipulator consigns an artwork to Sotheby’s and attempts wash trading, they will have to pay the auction house 25 per cent of the sale, making it a costly enterprise.

“With NFTs the costs are a fraction of that,” he said, referencing the transaction fees, known as gas fees, required to mint or purchase an NFT, which can fluctuate depending on demand.

Nevertheless, there are plenty of supporters who believe that the market is maturing and will eventually offer a host of features, such as allowing artists to collect royalties in perpetuity.

“What can you do because it’s software?” asked Benedict Evans, an independent technology analyst and a former venture capitalist. “That might be things like the artist gets a share and subsequent secondary sales,” he said, pointing to early innovations in the space around music rights in particular.

Already, the so-called financialisation of NFTs is taking place in some communities — for example, using NFTs as collateral for loans, or breaking down ownership of a single piece into smaller parts, known as fractionalisation.

In the longer term, enthusiasts hope tokens will one day power ecommerce in any metaverse or metaverses, futuristic digital avatar-filled virtual worlds. Here, NFTs could designate ownership of virtual goods, be that clothing for digital avatars or art for the walls of their digital houses. Nike recently announced that it had bought a virtual shoe company to mint virtual sneakers.

Either way, the future of the NFTs market will also depend on the stance that regulators take as the freewheeling market develops.

There are concerns, even among corporate issuers, that NFTs share characteristics with certain digital investment vehicles and therefore may be considered securities by regulators.

Devika Kornbacher, partner at Vinson and Elkins, said companies looking to issue NFTs regularly ask: “Is this NFT going to be viewed as a financial instrument? Will it be considered a security from our company?”

Meanwhile, tax agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service are yet to address NFTs directly, but some experts argue that they could be deemed “collectibles”, meaning they would be subject to capital gains taxes.

“It is a looming existential issue for the whole industry,” said Pratin Vallabhaneni, partner at White & Case, of impending regulation.

NFT-YAY OR NAY?,"NFT-YAY OR NAY?

NFTs are becoming everyone’s favorite topic to discuss in the current times. It is not common knowledge, but NFTs have been around since 2014, and only now they are gaining immense popularity because they are a convenient alternative to buying and selling digital artwork. NFT or Non- Fungible Token is a digital, non-interchangeable token.

They are forever linked and encrypted with the creators’ signature. There is a significant rise in the number of NFT stores, applications, and businesses. It's a type of a digital resource that can represent real art, music, video, and in-game data.

Non-Fungible Tokens are generally encrypted with the same software as other cryptos and traded on the market online, often with bitcoin. The biggest advantage of NFT is the fact that they are unique. The NFT market has become extremely competitive. One must devote time to conducting thorough research of their niche and then determine what problems their technique can solve.

There are several ways that you can earn through NFT. Let's take a look at the top 5 business ideas for entrepreneurs.

NFT Artist

If you have a creative mind and always wanted to shift your focus to digital art, now is a perfect time. NFTs were created in part to help artists make more money in a digital market that hasn't always treated them fairly. Bear in mind that you will have to face a strong competition though, so make sure that your work stands out.

Alas, there is just no single source of truth on how to create revenue-generating content. Our major piece of advice enjoy.

NFT Cryptocurrency

Crypto protocols concentrating on NFT shopping, interactive media, art, and other similar fields are becoming increasingly popular. Our advice to you is that understanding the niche, providing value, and engaging consumers are the most difficult aspects of this platform.

If your cryptocurrency doesn't have a meaning, a simple ""NFT"" prefix won't guarantee rapid success.

In less than a year, AXS coins went from zero to $70. In Axie Infinite, an NFT-based online game, the AXS currency is utilized to swap, in-game creatures. Even though video games are the primary motivator for AXS coins, the cryptocurrency has proven to be a consistent source of income for the protocol's creators.

NFT Online Course

As you learn more and more about NFT, you will see that even though everyone is talking about it, there are only a few who actually understand it fully. If you think you have gained enough knowledge about its services, and how to produce and sell them, you can also create a channel and dedicate your time to creating and uploading training sessions and creating your own brand. You can charge them according to your desire.

NFT Marketplace

Do you want to stumble into an NFT goldmine? Start NFT auctions. NFT marketplaces use the standard auction method. You will notice that their business strategies are also built on traditional markets. Each and every sale that is made through the NFT shop is subject to a predetermined fee deducted by these platforms. Given the rapid development of NFT art, starting your own NFT marketplace is one of the most promising business ideas for the coming days.

NFT Collectibles

Your innovations are only limited by your creativity when it comes to NFT collectibles. It goes without saying that the more creative you are, the more money you will make. Action figures, collector cards, comic books, paintings, and whatever else limited edition item you can think of, bring them to the NFT platform and start distributing. Bring fresh ideas to the marketplace and gain popularity.

Non-fungible tokens(NFT) have been around for a while, and the trend does not seem to be going away anytime soon. You will notice that the big sellers on the NFT right now are images(digital), GIFs, videos, and songs. And just like everything else, supply and demand are driving the price.

Since NFTs are scarce, and collectors want them all, they’re willing to pay a lot of money for them. Some people are also seeing them as an investment at the moment because they have the option to resell the NFT for a higher price later on. If you have a unique skill set and you still haven’t put that to use, don’t waste any more time.",https://medium.com/@nisa.samar93/nfts-are-becoming-everyones-favorite-topic-to-discuss-in-the-current-times-6d358cd60db0,['Nisa Samar'],2022-01-06 07:21:08.961000+00:00,"['Nft Course', 'Nft Marketplace', 'Nft Collectibles', 'Nft Blog', 'Nft']"

Maurice Lamar had a friend named Paul. He was the owner of a small business, maybe you’ve heard of it, Pixie Paul’s Packaging. I never liked Paul, but the guy sure knew how to promote his business in a fun way over time. I like to think I had a big part of his success, but I digress.

Pixies are small creatures, only a a couple of inches tall. They’re unable to speak, but can make sounds when they move. Incredibly animated creatures. Some can be super loyal, some can be super mischievous, but all have strong personalities.

Pixies run their own communities and have small cities scattered around the world. You’ll never find them if they don’t want to be found.

I was invited to visit a large Pixie City, and frankly, the small architecture is amazing. I must have felt like a giant monster to the Pixies, but they brought me in. The large underground cave they lived in didn’t get much foot traffic, so they were completely hidden, and they had large pockets specifically made for larger beings like humans.

They’re able to harvest and create a special resource, known as Pixie Dust, of course. It’s a valuable dust with the ability to give levitational powers to Cryptids and Cryptid Hunters temporarily.

With the rise of Pixie Paul’s Packaging becoming the number 1 corporation in the world, Pixie’s have become prevalent, but it wasn’t always that way. Paul didn’t even know what a Pixie looked like before me, but did I get any credit? I don’t think so.

The Zillaz NFT collection was created around the story of the Zillaz. There are 4 different breeds of Zillaz. These include the Zillaz, the Catzillaz, the Dogezillaz, and the Monkezillaz. Each breed emerged in 2031, one year after World War 3.

The Zillaz were the first breed to emerge after WW3. These are a type of lizard creature. The Catzillaz are a type of cat creature and are the meanest and most aggressive breed of Zillaz. They do not like humans. The Dogezillaz are modeled after man’s best friend; the dog. These are the only breed of Zillaz that are friendly with humans after WW3 and act as human protectors. The last breed of Zillaz, a type of monkey beast, is the Monkezillaz. These creatures have a much higher intelligence level than any of their counterpart breeds and have even developed their own economy.

Although not revealed yet, the Zillaz team plans to add 4 new breeds. These breeds will be attainable by breeding the existing Genesis Collection.

Utility

With the creation of a DAO, a storyline to fit the collection, $RAD (their utility token), and eventually breeding and merch, the roadmap for Zillaz has no shortage of exciting undertakings.

After mint, the Zillaz Team started by making a DAO. The creation of the DAO allows for private sections in the Discord for verified holders. These channels will allow holders to make decisions about Zilllaz future, which they will have a large role in creating. 100% of royalties go directly to the DAO which will give the DAO the funding to take part in the future of Zillaz, and make it what they want.

After the DAO was created, the wallets containing unlisted Zillaz were airdropped $RAD Token. This token is airdropped several times a week at random to wallets that contain delisted Zillaz. This is to discourage people from listing on secondary markets. With 2 Genesis Zillaz and 450 $RAD, holders will be able to breed their Zillaz and create one of four new breeds of Baby Zillaz. A total of 4848 Baby Zillaz will be created.

Along with all the benefits mentioned above, the Zillaz Team also plans to create holder-exclusive merch. According to their website, it will be things that holders want to buy and represent. Holders will also get the chance to claim 3D Voxel models of their Zillaz for later use in the metaverse.

The Zillaz team is also planning to release a game. It will be a fully immersive gaming experience where holders can use their Zillaz as avatars in the game. As it is mentioned several times on their website and in the founder’s Twitter bio, the Zillaz team is dead-set on bringing Zillaz into the metaverse in some form or fashion.

The Team

Although we could not find it directly mentioned, we believe there is only one creator and founder behind Zillaz. The creator is known as ToddlerNFT (sometimes called BriceVibes) on Discord and Twitter. Although we could not find a full name, his Twitter bio says that he is an orthodontist. He also mentions that he runs Zillaz like a business, which we believe is the correct approach to managing an NFT project.

We believe ToddlerNFT is the only creator and founder of Zillaz because he is the only person in the Zillaz discord with the founder’s role. There are also a few people with admin roles, such as NFTBricklayer. According to his Twitter bio, he is helping to build the project. We are not certain of his exact role, but we believe he is helping directly manage Zillaz in some way.

There are also several mods on the Zillaz Team that help run the discord such as Brice Lee, Rick Sanchez, and KNighT on Discord (could not find their Twitters). The mods are usually quite active in the Zillaz Discord.

Aside from their team, the Zillaz community has several well-known holders. Some of these include SolBigBrain, SolBuckets, IcedKnife, and a few other well-respected and OG members of the Solana NFT ecosystem. Although it is unclear if they help or advise behind the scenes, you can sometimes find these members hanging out in the Discord channels.

The Significance: What other projects(and buyers) can take away from Zillaz

Zillaz launched on December 15th with a mint price of 1 $Sol each. Currently sitting at a 12x from mint with a floor price of 12 $Sol (on December 30th), around 2 weeks after mint, it is obvious that Zillaz has been a huge success. Because of this, we wanted to determine what made them different.

The first major difference we have found is the Zillaz community. With only about 6k Twitter followers and 13k Discord members, the Zillaz have a relatively small following. Although they do not have the largest community, they do have one of the most devoted communities in Solana NFT’s. As mentioned earlier, they refer to themselves as the Bamilia or family. Members of the Zillaz community are constantly posting memes on Twitter and making words that shouldn’t start with a “b” start with a “b”. These memes and jokes have fostered a very interactive and joyful community.

The next major difference we see in the Zillaz is real utility. With the combination of a utility token, breeding, 3D models, merch, and the other things mentioned previously, they have created a real demand for their collection. Because breeding requires 2 Zillaz and 450 $RAD, many members have multiple Zillaz. Because the genesis collection is only 2,424 NFT’s total and there are incentives to buy more than one, less than 10% of the total supply is listed at the time of this article.

As mentioned earlier, ToddlerNFT runs Zillaz like a business. He has done a great job of making a fully immersive project. He has created a story around the collection that makes it incredibly entertaining and adds a plot for the videogame down the road, a utility token that provides real benefits to holders, and there will eventually be physical merch. Not only does ToddlerNFT have the technical aspects of the project covered, he also managed to excel in arguably the most necessary part of the project: building a community.

Closing Comments

Zillaz have already started checking things off their roadmap, and they are geared for long-term success. The Zillaz have already created their DAO, holders have already received the $RAD airdrop, and they have begun to put breeding into motion. Although the Zillaz team has been quick to begin completing the roadmap, they have a long-term vision that ToddlerNFT is determined to achieve.

Although there are no details yet, a second roadmap will eventually be released, according to their website. This will probably include details about how Zillaz plan to expand into the metaverse and crypto gaming.

Graph by bmirc

Time Sensitive Opinion

Although Zillaz have been on a steady climb upward, as shown on the graph above, they are sitting at a 12x from mint and it is unreasonable to be certain they will keep climbing in the near future. Although they could see a bit of a dip, with a competent founder, hardworking team, and big plans for the future, Zillaz has the potential to have a promising future. If the community stays as involved and excited about the project as they have been, it will not fail.

Update: Latest Lightstreams Wallet with Coming NFT-C support.,"We are pleased to officially announce the latest release of the Lightstreams Wallet 0.0.6. The wallet’s first release was announced in June, with the primary aim of helping users to easily get started using Lightstreams by not having to set up custom configurations as they would with other wallets such as MetaMask.

The first version supported the basic functionality of sending and receiving PHT coins. Now the latest version supports the connection of a web application (once approved) to the wallet with the following features:

- Reading account balances

- Deploying smart contracts

- Sending transactions to smart contracts

- Adding Tokens

- Interacting with Tokens

- Signing messages

With these latest features, developers can build web applications for their users who have the Lightstreams Wallet installed so that they can easily interact with the Lightstreams blockchain using a customised web interface.

In the video below you can see the new wallet in action with an example test web interface.

Lightstreams Wallet 0.0.6

What else have we been working on?

Many tasks happen behind the scenes in order to maintain the Lightstreams blockchain and infrastructure, many of which are very technical in nature or proprietary. A major task that can be mentioned was the successful upgrade of infrastructure that supports the Lightstreams blockchain that will allow for greater expansion in the near future.

This was quite an undertaking and involved upgrading validator and sentry nodes. The team did an excellent job and there was no network downtime. For a small project, the team is proud that the Lightstreams blockchain has been operating seamlessly for 2.5 years without any incidents.

What’s next?

The team has been working on a new NFT (Non Fungible Token) called an NFT-C (Non Fungible Token with Content), which we are aiming that the next release of the Lightstreams Wallet will support. Unlike standard NFTs, the owner of an NFT-C will be able to control who has access to the content attached to the token by sending transactions to the Lightstreams blockchain approving access permission.

Lightstreams wallet supporting an NFT-C transaction

The NFT-C standard will enable a new dimension beyond standard NFTs, giving the owner the ability to generate income by leasing or renting their digital art, video, or music to applications and their users.

We will be releasing more technical details soon for those that want to learn more about NFT-Cs and how they can start incorporating them into their projects.

With this upcoming release, we will be focussing on partnership deals with leading NFT exchanges and services to begin supporting of NFT-Cs by integrating Lightstreams into their ecosystems.

2021 São Paulo Grand Prix — Stats Preview,"If one carnival wasn’t enough, it’s time for round two, this time in Brazil for Round 19 of the world championship. After being unable to host a race for the first time since 1973, Brazil makes a much-awaited comeback to the calendar with the event now titled the ‘São Paulo Grand Prix’. As the season slowly nears its end, everyone’s eyes will be on the numbers considering so little separates our title rivals. This weekend’s race definitely has the potential to swing it either way.

A country that is just as passionate as Mexico, Brazil is set to host its 47th Grand Prix. A majority of those races (37) have been held at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in the neighbourhood of Interlagos. The circuit was inaugurated in 1940 but was acquainted with Formula 1 only in 1973 after the success of Brazil’s first world champion, Emerson Fittipaldi. After a brief switch to Rio de Janeiro ( Nelson Piquet’s hometown), the event returned to Interlagos in 1990 after the emergence of Ayrton Senna, a São Paulo local.

Inspired by the Roosevelt Raceway in the USA and named in honour of José Carlos Pace, the circuit is the fourth-shortest one on the calendar at 4.309km. Quite undulating in nature and one of the few anticlockwise venues of the year, its first and third sectors are run largely flat-out, which is balanced out by the snaky in-field section in sector two. It is located around 800m above sea level making it Formula 1’s second-highest circuit in altitude and features one of the longest pitlanes in the sport.

(Motorsport Stats)

Top honours in Brazil go to the legendary pairing of Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna. Prost has six wins to his name — five of which came in Rio de Janeiro — while Senna claimed six pole positions during his time, three more than anyone else. McLaren remains the team to beat in Brazil with 12 victories and 11 pole positions across both venues. At Interlagos, the Germans proved more powerful as Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel racked up four and three wins respectively. No other driver has won more than twice at this circuit. Schumacher also leads the podium charts with 10 podiums between 1992 and 2002.

Pole position in Mexico has proven costly in recent years but conversely has been quite beneficial in Brazil. Six of the last seven races in Interlagos have been won from pole. Also, every Brazilian Grand Prix since 2008 has been won from the front row. With the front-runners carrying such an advantage, it could seem the circuit provides fewer opportunities to pass, but in fact, Interlagos has one of the highest overtake percentages in the hybrid era — an average of 43 overtakes per race. That said, drivers starting further back have also shone from time to time. Giancarlo Fisichella after starting eighth in a Jordan, won the 2003 race in bizarre circumstances and was awarded the trophy only at the next race, whereas Carlos Sainz scored a podium finish in 2019 after starting from the back of the grid.

The sprint format returns for the third and last time this year. Max Verstappen is yet to score points in a Grand Prix that has included sprint qualifying. He clashed with Lewis Hamilton in the previous two sprint iterations (Britain and Italy). With 29 points on offer (25 for race win, 3 for sprint and 1 for fastest lap), it’s perhaps the best opportunity for Hamilton to claw his way back into the championship fight.

But it could be a tough ask for the defending champion. Interlagos is one of Hamilton’s least favourite circuits in terms of numbers. In 13 appearances, he has stood on the podium just five times with two wins, while his average of 10 points per race is one of his lowest amongst all circuits. However, Mercedes do have a good record at this venue. They have a 100% scoring streak and have won here on four occasions in the hybrid era.

Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes AMG F1 W09 — Won in 2018 (Motorsport Images)

The favourites tag goes to the in-form Red Bull team once again this weekend. They have won five of the last eleven races here with Verstappen triumphing from pole in 2019. The Dutchman could have tasted victory once more had it not been for his late-race collision with Esteban Ocon in 2018. Nevertheless, Verstappen will be eyeing a clean sweep of races in the Americas this year after previously winning in USA and Mexico.

Eight drivers from the current grid have stood on the podium in Interlagos. Fernando Alonso tops that list with eight podiums but has surprisingly never won here. He remains the only one in the top-12 of the drivers’ standings not to take a podium finish this year. Daniel Ricciardo had a torrid race last weekend and will look to bounce back with a good points haul. He is set to surpass Nico Rosberg for the second-most consecutive race starts in Formula 1–206. With each season comprising over 20 races, the Aussie could overhaul Lewis Hamilton’s record (265) in 2024.

The nation that sits third (101) in the all-time wins list, Brazil has missed the presence of a local driver for a few years now. The last Brazilian to drive in front of his home crowd was Felipe Massa in 2017, while the last one to win a race was Rubens Barrichello in Italy 2009. One of the most experienced racers, Barrichello surprisingly never stood on the top step in Brazil and unfortunately had to settle with a solitary podium in 19 home appearances.

The race in Brazil always tends to produce drama in some form or the other. Interlagos has played host to six drivers’ title showdowns in the past, some of the most memorable ones being 2008 and 2012. Although the championship won’t be decided this Sunday, it will nevertheless leave at an exciting juncture for the next three races.",https://medium.com/f1-statsguru/2021-s%C3%A3o-paulo-grand-prix-stats-preview-8cc9f7123b2,['Sundaram Ramaswami'],2022-01-23 20:44:05.081000+00:00,"['Brazil', 'F1', 'Formula 1', 'F1 2021', 'Statistics']"

Problem Statement: How would you design dynamic pricing for a ride-sharing application. What factors will you consider while analyzing the problem?

Priyanka: There were some clarifying questions that I would like to ask to understand the problem in a better way.

Firstly from what I understand, dynamic pricing means that the price of a ride is not constant and depends on a number of variables. For example — When I request a cab ride from my office to home on a rainy day the fare of the ride is not the same as it is on a normal day.

Interviewer: Yes, that is correctly defined.

Priyanka: Should we design a dynamic pricing model assuming it does not exist or improve the existing dynamic pricing model?

Interviewer: You can assume the first option — design a dynamic pricing model assuming it does not exist.

Priyanka: Is there any specific geography that we are considering?

Interviewer: You can focus on India as of now.

Priyanka: Ok since the platform has both driver and rider sides do you want me to focus on any specific one?

Interviewer: You are free to choose.

Priyanka: I would focus on both as I think dynamic pricing affects both parties.

Interviewer: Sure, go ahead.

Priyanka: Firstly, I would like to define the goals of dynamic pricing. Dynamic pricing helps to:

- Reduce the demand supply mismatch - Compensate drivers by providing them better revenue - Provide service to people who intend to pay higher for it

Interviewer: That sounds correct.

Priyanka: Now I would like to think about the data variables that might drive the price of a ride:

Weather conditions — Due to harsh weather conditions like heavy rain, thunderstorms there are more road closures leading to traffic jams. The usual trip might take a longer duration. This affects the supply of drivers thus having an effect on fare. Festivals/Big events — If there are major events like cricket matches or famous personality visits or even during festivals a large number of people request rides. Due to this, there is a sudden demand-supply mismatch. Traffic/Peak time of the day — After work hours are usually peak hours since a lot of people are returning home from work which also affects the traffic conditions in that area. For example — In normal days before Covid, the road near tech parks was usually jammed around 5–6 pm when most of the people are leaving for their home from work. Competitive Pricing — Competition plays a huge role in determining the prices especially in a fragmented market like India with two main competitors — Uber and Ola and a few emerging players like Rapido or Jugnoo.

Interviewer: Now that you have identified some of the factors how will you go about implementing the dynamic pricing?

Priyanka: Some of the methods I can think of are:

- We can use a machine learning model to analyze multiple variables, such as historical data, traffic conditions, holidays and weather, to ultimately determine the demand for the drivers. Leveraging this information, we can then generate the optimal price at different times of the day, week and month. - We can use a deep learning model like Long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict unprecedented events or the future stances of an event as LSTM allows information to persist.[1] - We need to set thresholds for the difference between supply and demand when surge needs to be enabled or disabled. For example — if demand > supply by 10 cars then we can apply surge pricing and vice versa. We need to experiment with different limits to come up with the optimal number.

Interviewer: How would the dynamic pricing feature get displayed in the app?

Priyanka: We can design the feature in the following ways:

Notification alerts should be sent to both driver and riders once the surge is going to apply and also once the surge ends so that riders who were not willing to book a ride during surge can wait while those who are willing to pay can take the ride.

To prevent drivers from taking undue advantage of surges we can set up rules that do not allow a driver to turn off his availability more than a given number of times.

Interviewer: How would you measure the success of your implementation?

Priyanka: Some of the success metrics we can take into consideration are:

No. of rides requested after seeing the price surge notification.

No of Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active users

Average earnings per driver

Interviewer: Thank you. We are done with the discussion.

"Health Is Not Fitness, But We Need Both","What is the meaning of fitness? Well, that depends on who you ask. The word fitness can be spread thin when it comes to defining what it is. Fitness can have a different meaning for different groups because it is activity-specific.

Physical fitness for a powerlifter is not the same kind of fitness for a triathlete. In general, physical fitness is being able to apply the required strength and energy to complete specific physical activities. If a powerlifter cannot complete a triathlon, then he would not be considered fit among a group of competing triathletes.

Health is different from fitness, but like fitness, there are variations of health. In general, health is being free from illness and sustaining overall wellness. Within this concept, the dimensions of health are physical, mental, and social. Having a healthy body that is not affected by disease or physical impairments is a general description of physical health.

Good mental health is more than just the absence of mental illness. It means you are in a state of well-being where you feel good and function well in the world. Some keys to being in a state of good mental health are:

the ability to learn

the ability to feel, express, and manage a range of positive and negative emotions

the ability to form and maintain good relationships with others

the ability to cope with and manage change and uncertainty.

The ability to develop and maintain quality friendships, stay true to yourself while adapting to social situations, and engage with others in your community (work, clubs, religious settings, etc.) are all signs of good social health.

Health and fitness are often conflated because neither can be attained without proper nutrition. Yes, your mental health is impacted by a poor diet. Nutritional information is a description of how you are either contributing to health and fitness, which are dimensions of wellness or feeding into sickness and disease.

The Burning Secret Of Fat…,"White fat stores excess energy, whereas brown and beige fat are thermogenic and dissipate energy as heat. Thermogenic adipose tissues markedly improve glucose and lipid homeostasis in mouse models, although the extent to which brown adipose tissue (BAT) influences metabolic and cardiovascular disease in humans is unclear. Here we retrospectively categorized 134,529 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography–computed tomography scans from 52,487 patients, by presence or absence of BAT, and used propensity score matching to assemble a study cohort. Scans in the study population were initially conducted for indications related to cancer diagnosis, treatment or surveillance, without previous stimulation. We report that individuals with BAT had lower prevalence’s of cardiometabolic diseases, and the presence of BAT was independently correlated with lower odds of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure and hypertension. These findings were supported by improved blood glucose, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein values. The beneficial effects of BAT were more pronounced in individuals with overweight or obesity, indicating that BAT might play a role in mitigating the deleterious effects of obesity. Taken together, our findings highlight a potential role for BAT in promoting cardiometabolic health.

As early as 2003, reports described increased uptake of the glucose analog 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) on positron emission tomography (PET) scans in areas corresponding to supraclavicular fat on computed tomography (CT) images, suggesting the presence of metabolically active BAT in adult humans. In 2009, a series of papers confirmed the presence of active BAT in adults, which correlated with lower body mass index (BMI), decreased age, colder outdoor temperature, female sex and decreased glucose levels. Since then, small prospective studies in healthy humans have demonstrated that cold-activated BAT is associated with increased energy expenditure and enhanced disposal of glucose and free fatty acids.

A Sparkling State of Mind,"R. Dumont et Fils Brut Champagne Champagne, France

Forget eggs Benedict and avocado toast, I’m having champagne for breakfast. And for the love of God, keep your orange juice far away from this dazzling, festive, frothy liquid gold. The sophisticated bliss of tasting champagne never fades so when I had the opportunity to enjoy this R. Dumont et Fils Brut Champagne, I couldn’t say no. The aromas of this wine are simply tantalizing — toasted brioche, shortbread, lemon meringue pie, fresh biscuits. On the palate, the lively texture of the mousse reminds me of Pop Rocks infused bright notes of tart green apples and fresh-from-the-tree Meyer lemons. Why is champagne so special anyways? It’s far more than just a glass of wine, it’s a state of mind. Throughout history, philosophers, celebrity icons, writers, and politicians site champagne as an expression of pure joy, celebratory occasion or not, and even a source of motivation during wartimes (hey, Sir Winston Churchill). What’s more iconic than the pop of a cork followed by the charming gurgle of the wine being poured into the glass? For the best pairing, indulge in Thomas Keller’s buttermilk fried chicken from Addendum in Napa Valley. So, forget the nonsense that says bubbles are only for the holidays, this is definitely not a wine to forget about after January 1st.

How To Lose Weight Fast In 3 Simple Steps| |Diet Plan,"Andrei Luca Hillary Clinton Dave Bragdon weight loss tips Realist Weightloss Journey Weightloss Nutrition weight lose

If women are healthy and have no menorrhagia problems, then doing nothing is the right choice. The most important thing is that women understand their bodies and understand that if menorrhagia is a problem, they can choose hysterectomy. Dr Bradley said that some women avoid helping during menorrhagia because they worry about how to lose weight fast and hysterectomy is their only option.

How to Lose Weight Fast?

Yes, even women who adhere to what most people consider “healthy weight” may need to gain weight in order to resume their menstrual cycle. For most ladies, you will need to head return to the weight you were the final time you had your period, and you could even want to move further. There is no set amount or percentage of body fat to achieve, but you will know that you have gained enough weight when your period returns.

Once you find a level that will support your menstrual cycles, you can work to maintain that balance of weight and energy by increasing your calories as your mileage increases. You should cut back on your mileage and increase your calorie intake (again from healthy foods) until your cycle resumes. After 3 periods, you can gradually move to a more intuitive eating style OR slowly add exercise again.

First, I can’t stress enough how important it is to keep what you did to recover from the first cycle. I have seen too many women who have their first periods, they think “HEY, I really urge you not to worry or worry about when this second ovulation / period will come. If you are struggling with a loop, know that there is something you can do to fix it. There are many reasons why we may not have healthy periods, but there are many things we can do to bring them back.

And if so, then this body of yours is telling you that this must happen in order to get to a healthy place. If you cut calories and inadvertently skip periods, your body is likely not getting enough nutrition to support some of its basic functions (such as reproduction).

In the face of weight loss, loss of menstruation often indicates that your body’s energy reserves are insufficient to support your menstrual cycle. Athletic women often skip their menstrual periods when they exercise hard or follow a weight loss diet. According to Brown, one of the most common reasons for women to stop menstruating is simply a lack of fat. Weight loss because of malnutrition is characterised by using low insulin ranges in the frame, and due to the fact insulin regulates the hormones that reason menstruation, low insulin = no menstruation.

Both weight loss and weight gain can cause delayed or reduced menstruation. Muscular women are more likely to have a higher BMI when receiving HA, which suggests that lack of body fat is more important than absolute weight. Even if your weight is “normal”, you may lose menstruation, but you will still have hypothalamic amenorrhea.

It may sound simple, but following a healthy and balanced diet is one way to restore your menstrual cycle and keep your menstrual cycle healthy. I suggest reading this NCBI article for a more in-depth explanation of your cycle and hormones, and how missing your period affects your body.

My eating disorder (my not-so-healthy habits, definitely unacceptable) caused my amenorrhea, so I knew I had to rid my life of such destructive behavior and accept something that would last a lifetime, because I want my period to last for a long time. … On this journey, I prayed that not only would my period return, but that God would heal my broken relationship with food and develop a healthy mindset that would sustain me for the rest of my life.

Of course, I still have to fight: even though I am absent from class, I still have to pierce the voice that keeps telling me to eat less and exercise more in my mind. However, prayer is at the core of every step I take her back. I not only pray often, but also often pray for real and lasting healthy habits. At first, I really thought that in order to get my menstruation back, all I had to do was to get rid of mental stress, but I didn’t want to admit that I still exercise too much and I am not fat enough.

There are women who can compete in figures, lower their body fat percentage to 15, but they still have periods and even get pregnant quite easily. There are women who do not have a depleted period, but still have a bad attitude towards food and exercise.

This is a peculiar term that means that a woman stops her menstrual cycle because she is below the weight her body wants (this is not determined by the BMI chart), or because she exercises too much/too vigorously. Excessive exercise can also cause intermittent menstruation or menopause. Even if you eat enough, you can skip menstruation due to overtraining. Severe overtraining can lead to cycle loss, and you don’t need to be underweight for this to happen.

Stress has a profound effect on the endocrine system and hormones, and if you don’t address the root cause of stress and imbalance, you won’t be able to recover from your period. Always remember how stress can affect your cycle and your hormones. If you’ve been consuming more and exercising much less for more than 6 months and your period hasn’t back but, the primary thing you want to do is end up your proper self.

Changes in order to will let you obviously get over your duration. If you aren’t menstruating, however, aren’t underweight, be aware that you can nevertheless have hypothalamic amenorrhea. If you’ve ever lost weight, even though it become the best 10 pounds, and even if it occurred many years ago, it could be enough to forestall the normal production of hormones.

My cycle returned when I gained all 30 pounds, and no, it wasn’t just muscle, I needed more fat too. When we reverse our diet and go back to eating again, there is a chance of weight gain.

Just because you are not menstruating does not always mean that you are not ovulating, so you can still get pregnant. If you want to try to get pregnant, how long it takes for your period to return after you stop using contraception depends on your body and your choice of contraception. Most of the time, your menstrual cycle will return to normal, so unless you’re trying to get pregnant, you really don’t need to do anything.

Marketing for Small business,"Marketing is an essential part of the success of any business. It doesn’t matter how good your product or service is; if nobody knows about it, you won’t make enough money to stay in business. If you’re having trouble, then this article is for you! We will be teaching you reasons why hiring us for your business’s Digital Marketing could be the solution that gets your sales going again.

Digital Marketing for Small Business:

A company can reach out to a large number of customers if they know how to use digital marketing efficiently. Potential customers could be sitting on the other side of the world and belong to entirely different cultures, but that makes no difference as long as businesses prepare themselves beforehand with their digital marketing strategies. Companies that advertise digitally gain more attention than those that don’t, and this also results in gaining trust through better public relations tactics and improved customer satisfaction for the products or services offered by the company. The world is going digital. We have a choice to be part of this change or remain stuck in the past. While some companies have been slow on the uptake, it’s essential to consider the following reasons why digital marketing is so crucial for your business.

Budget-Friendly:

Digital marketing is much more cost-effective than other means of advertisement, which makes it an excellent way for small businesses to market their products. Low-cost services can be very beneficial to small business owners looking for ways to attract the attention of potential customers without having to break the bank or go into debt. Pay-per-click advertisements are one example where companies only pay when someone actually clicks on their advertisement and visits their site, allowing them to save money if they aren’t certain about how well their product will sell.

Reach:

Digital marketing also has a wide reach because companies can easily use social media channels for advertising their product or service and distributing any promotional content they might have. Social media is an excellent way for brands to market themselves as it allows them to interact with potential customers almost instantly by making posts and sending messages, allowing those who pay attention to take advantage of special offers and deals which will eventually help the business’s product or service become more popular.

Sooner or later, a business needs to make a decision about whether they want to advertise for their products and services or not. Making this decision isn’t going to be easy, but if you keep in mind what kind of return on digital investment marketing could provide, you’ll find it much easier to make a decision.

Increased Brand Awareness:

Having advertising is extremely important in the world of business because it allows companies to be more competitive when compared to their competitors. A company that advertises for their products or services will eventually gain brand recognition, so even if someone sees an advertisement once and doesn’t take much notice, they’ll still subconsciously remember that slogan or logo. Sooner or later, this could result in them buying the promoted product just because they recognize the company’s name after having seen it before. This would prove very beneficial for any small business owner looking to expand their customer base.

2021 NBA Power Ratings,"Health and safety protocols continue to be a concern around the league. Several stars sat out their teams’ Christmas Day matchups, including Trae Young, Luka Doncic and Kevin Durant, though James Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo returned to action for Saturday’s slate of games.

Antetokounmpo led the Milwaukee Bucks past the Boston Celtics, while Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors took the rubber match against the Phoenix Suns. Harden and the Brooklyn Nets overcame LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers on the final Saturday of the year.

In the last Power Rankings of 2021, our NBA experts break down each team’s New Year’s resolutions. How can the league-best Warriors and Suns get even better? Can Kyrie Irving improve the Nets as a part-time player? Can the Bucks’ Big Three stay healthy? Can James and the Lakers find consistency in the new year?

What about the teams fighting for contention? Who needs to add a player before the deadline? Here’s where all 30 teams can improve in 2022.

Golden State Warriors 2021–22 record: 27–6 Previous ranking: 2

After knocking off the Suns on Christmas Day, Steve Kerr and Co. don’t appear to have many worries. The key for this group is to get healthy and keep the momentum rolling in the second half of the season. In the short term, that means getting Andrew Wiggins, Damion Lee, Jordan Poole and Moses Moody out of health and safety protocols and getting Klay Thompson (ACL and Achilles rehab) and James Wiseman (meniscus rehab) back in the next few weeks. — Friedell

2. Phoenix Suns

2021–22 record: 26–6

Previous ranking: 1

It’s hard to find much to improve upon in a team with the second-best winning percentage in the NBA. But the Suns are in the bottom five in the league at just 10.6 second-chance points per game and 24th overall in offensive rebounds per game. Of course, those things are easier to deal with when you’re third in the league in scoring and second in field-goal percentage. — Lopez

3. Brooklyn Nets

2021–22 record: 22–9

Previous ranking: 3

Although Brooklyn has welcomed back Kyrie Irving, his immediate entry into the NBA’s health and safety protocols has delayed his official return to the court. The Nets, with their title aspirations, will hope to successfully navigate a truly unprecedented situation, having to incorporate a part-time player into their mix. Irving still can’t play in games in New York City due to its vaccine mandate. — Bontemps

4. Utah Jazz

2021–22 record: 23–9

Previous ranking: 4

Utah could use an athletic wing to address some of the perimeter defensive issues that cut their playoff run short last season. The Jazz had offseason trade discussions involving Joe Ingles, sources said. Ingles (an expiring $14 million contract) and a future first-round pick could generate significant interest in the trade market, but that would mean Utah giving up a critical role player who is a major part of the Jazz’s culture. — MacMahon

5. Milwaukee Bucks

2021–22 record: 22–13

Previous ranking: 5

The Bucks may not be dominating the regular season like they have in the past, but their team hasn’t been truly whole for most of this year. Still, Milwaukee has to be encouraged that when its Big Three — Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday — all start, they are 13–2 this season. Keeping them healthy for a chance to defend their championship should be the Bucks main resolution for 2021. — Collier

6. Chicago Bulls

2021–22 record: 20–10

Previous ranking: 6

Now that the Bulls have established themselves among the top teams in the Eastern Conference, they should look to fortify their rotation for the postseason. Adding a quality bench player at the trade deadline would help maximize this team’s potential this season. The bench, which is 29th in the NBA in scoring, could use a boost, especially in the frontcourt. The Bulls mostly rely on the group of Alex Caruso, Ayo Dosunmu, Coby White and Derrick Jones Jr. in a guard-heavy rotation off the bench. — Collier

7. Miami Heat

2021–22 record: 21–13

Previous ranking: 8

Like so many other teams, one of Miami’s biggest issues is that it hasn’t found consistency early in the year because of a variety of injuries. Jimmy Butler is finally back after missing a few weeks because of a tailbone injury. Bam Adebayo is still out as he recovers from thumb surgery. Kyle Lowry recently entered health and safety protocols. If they get healthy, the Heat have the type of established veteran talent that no team would want to deal with in a playoff series. — Friedell

8. Cleveland Cavaliers

2021–22 record: 20–13

Previous ranking: 7

The Cavs would love to have Jarrett Allen teach Evan Mobley some of his post moves. As wonderful as the start to Mobley’s career has been — along with the team’s surprising success that’s gone with it — the rookie center is shooting 47.4% from the field while Allen, in his sixth season, is shooting a ridiculous 70.2%. Imagine if Mobley can trend in that direction? — McMenamin

9. Memphis Grizzlies

2021–22 record: 19–14

Previous ranking: 9

The Grizzlies have exceeded expectations, establishing themselves in the fourth spot in the West standings and strengthening that position during Ja Morant’s 12-game absence due to a knee sprain. For Memphis to hold on to home-court advantage in the first round, the Grizzlies must figure out how to maintain their defensive success with Morant (116.1 points allowed per 100 possessions with him on the floor). It helps to have Dillon Brooks healthy. — MacMahon

10. Philadelphia 76ers

2021–22 record: 17–16

Previous ranking: 12

The 76ers’ biggest resolution could be figuring out what will happen with Ben Simmons between now and the NBA’s trade deadline. There may not be a bigger question in the NBA this season than whether the All-Star guard’s situation in Philadelphia will be resolved, and as a result, whether superstar center Joel Embiid will get some additional help to make a playoff push. — Bontemps

11. Denver Nuggets

2021–22 record: 16–16

Previous ranking: 11

The reigning MVP is shooting and rebounding better than a season ago, but Nikola Jokic doesn’t have Jamal Murray yet this season and he lost Michael Porter Jr. for the season. Murray’s return is uncertain after suffering a torn ACL last April. But if Jokic can keep the Nuggets afloat in the playoff hunt, a return by Murray will make them a dangerous team that few would want to see in the playoffs. — Youngmisuk

12. LA Clippers

2021–22 record: 17–16

Previous ranking: 10

The biggest issue for the Clippers is their health. They came into the season without Kawhi Leonard, whose return from ACL surgery looms in the background. But the Clippers have lost Paul George for at least the next month, but likely longer, due to a torn ligament in his shooting elbow. Reggie Jackson remains in health and safety protocols, though Marcus Morris Sr. just got cleared and is nearing a return. Tyronn Lue has shown he can extract more than people think out of a cast of role players, as he did last season. Now he has to keep the Clippers within striking range of a playoff spot until George, and possibly Leonard, return. — Youngmisuk

13. Charlotte Hornets

2021–22 record: 17–17

Previous ranking: 16

Charlotte has a 114.2 defensive rating, which is the worst in the league. The Hornets are a young, exciting team, but if they can’t get a better defensive effort on a nightly basis they will never turn into the type of consistent playoff threat they hoped to be entering this season. — Friedell

14. Los Angeles Lakers

2021–22 record: 16–18

Previous ranking: 13

The Lakers need to find some consistency. They have used 18 different starting lineups through their first 34 games, which tops the league. With Anthony Davis out for at least the next month, L.A. will have to find a go-to lineup centered around LeBron James and Russell Westbrook that it can stick with and not fall too far behind the top four in the West. — McMenamin

15. Washington Wizards

2021–22 record: 17–16

Previous ranking: 14

Washington has exceeded expectations — even if it has cooled off after a hot start — but the Wizards still have room to get even better. With Bradley Beal in health and safety protocols, they have to stay afloat while their star guard is out. Washington isn’t close to being whole with Thomas Bryant still working his way back from a torn ACL. Rui Hachimura has yet to make his season debut due to personal reasons but is getting closer. Washington could be back to full strength by February, and if Beal starts playing like he has the past two seasons, the Wizards can solidify their place in the East’s top five. — Youngmisuk

16. Boston Celtics

2021–22 record: 16–17

Previous ranking: 15

Celtics coach Ime Udoka has stressed pushing the pace and increasing ball movement since taking over the job this summer. Yet Boston finds itself 20th in pace and in the bottom 10 in both assists and potential assists per game so far — all of which are helping contribute to Boston’s 21st-ranked offense. — Bontemps

17. Dallas Mavericks

2021–22 record: 15–17

Previous ranking: 17

The Mavs are light on assets required for rookie GM Nico Harrison to make significant roster upgrades, so improvement will likely need to come from within. Luka Doncic rounding into shape and returning to All-NBA form would be a great start. Dallas also desperately needs Reggie Bullock and Tim Hardaway Jr. to snap out of season-long slumps and shoot the 3 at clips closer to their career norms. — MacMahon

18. Atlanta Hawks

2021–22 record: 15–17

Previous ranking: 18

As ESPN’s Zach Lowe pointed out on Friday, Atlanta hasn’t been the best in transition defense this season. But one thing it has been good at is shooting the deep ball. The Hawks lead the league while shooting 37.8% from deep. Bogdan Bogdanovic is shooting 36.3% this season — above league average — and is still 12th on the team for anyone who has attempted a 3-pointer this season. If the 3s continue to fall at that rate, it’ll allow Atlanta some room for error as it gets healthier to fix the defense. — Lopez

19. Toronto Raptors

2021–22 record: 14–16

Previous ranking: 20

Toronto has been true to its preseason defensive expectations in terms of playing fast, athletic and small. The Raptors are among the bottom five teams in the league in opposing offensive rebounding rate and they are among the top five teams in the league in forcing turnovers. If Toronto can improve the former, and keep the latter, the Raptors can move up from the middle of the pack in defense and make a push to return to the playoffs. — Bontemps

20. Minnesota Timberwolves

2021–22 record: 15–17

Previous ranking: 19

Minnesota looks like it could grab a spot in the Western Conference play-in tournament this season and in both Karl-Anthony Towns and Anthony Edwards, the Timberwolves have a pair of young stars they can build around. Edwards’ continued development and Towns’ quiet excellence should give the Wolves a good foundation to build on and in 2022, they should continue to surround that duo with talent that complements their games. — Collier

21. New York Knicks

2021–22 record: 15–18

Previous ranking: 22

Coach Tom Thibodeau’s teams have always been known as being hard-nosed defensively. That’s what makes it particularly jarring to see New York sitting at 23rd in defensive rating almost halfway through this season. The Knicks have plenty of problems, but if they want things to improve, getting the defense right would be a good place to start. — Bontemps

22. San Antonio Spurs

2021–22 record: 14–18

Previous ranking: 25

San Antonio is fourth at preventing opponent’s free throw attempts but is also near the bottom in the league in getting to the line. Derrick White and Keldon Johnson are San Antonio’s only two players averaging at least three free throws a game. A few more trips to the line would go a long way in helping the Spurs attempt to get back to the playoffs after missing the past two seasons (after making 22 in a row). — Lopez

23. Indiana Pacers

2021–22 record: 14–20

Previous ranking: 23

The Pacers have built around the same ensemble of players for years, yet they haven’t broken through to challenge the conference’s true elite and are currently in line to miss the playoffs this season. For Indiana, finding a direction in 2022 should be essential. Can the Pacers stay on the course with the same core and expect to compete, or is a roster shakeup on the horizon? — Collier

24. Portland Trail Blazers

2021–22 record: 13–19

Previous ranking: 21

From the investigation into and then firing of GM Neil Olshey to the trade speculation surrounding Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum, Portland’s season is on the brink. The organization needs to decide whether to change the roster around Lillard or make sweeping changes and rebuild since the Blazers are six games under .500. Or, they can stick with what they have and hope that the team finds its groove with rookie coach Chauncey Billups and make a run for a playoff spot. — Youngmisuk

25. New Orleans Pelicans

2021–22 record: 12–22

Previous ranking: 27

A healthy Zion Williamson would be a big boost to a team that seems to be figuring things out. After a 3–16 start, New Orleans is 9–5 in their past 14 games. The Pelicans announced Williamson received an injection in his foot on Dec. 15 and that he would be reevaluated in 4 to 6 weeks. Adding Williamson to the lineup could help the Pelicans with their push for the play-in tournament. — Lopez

26. Sacramento Kings

2021–22 record: 13–21

Previous ranking: 24

The Kings need to find better looks on the perimeter. They rank 24th in the league in 3-point percentage and 24th in assists per game. The stats are linked, of course. It takes smart spacing and crisp passing to generate great opportunities from deep in today’s game, with defenses hyper-aware of the 3-point line. Tyrese Haliburton, who has topped 10 assists in four straight games, could be the key to getting the Kings on track. — McMenamin

27. Oklahoma City Thunder

2021–22 record: 12–20

Previous ranking: 28

Oklahoma City’s rebuild is still in its early stages, but rookie Josh Giddey and 22-year-old Lu Dort seem to have established themselves as long-term core pieces alongside franchise cornerstone Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. So it makes sense to keep giving Giddey, a gifted passer, and Dort, a lockdown defender who has made huge strides as a scorer, plenty of room to stretch their wings offensively, even (or especially) if it costs OKC a few wins this season. — MacMahon

28. Houston Rockets

2021–22 record: 10–23

Previous ranking: 26

No. 2 overall pick Jalen Green’s development is, and has always been, the top priority for Houston this season. The Rockets’ sudden surge to competitiveness coincided with Green missing an extended stretch due to a hamstring strain, but the biggest factor was Houston’s shift to a small lineup, which should give Green more space to operate now that he’s back. He used his time off to make his shot release smoother and quicker, which paid off during Green’s 20-point, 25-minute performance in his return. — MacMahon

29. Orlando Magic

2021–22 record: 7–27

Previous ranking: 29

Orlando needs a talent influx. The hope is that injured building blocks Markelle Fultz and Jonathan Isaac return in the near future to provide a lift after rehabbing knee injuries. The same goes for Jalen Suggs, who is recovering from a thumb fracture. If all three players return and can help the young group find some consistency, it could alter the Magic’s lottery odds into the spring. — Friedell

30. Detroit Pistons

2021–22 record: 5–27

Previous ranking: 30

The Pistons hit lottery gold in 2021 by landing the No. 1 pick in the draft, Cade Cunningham, to jump-start their rebuild. They still, however, have the fewest wins in the NBA this season. Their biggest resolution in 2022 should be some progress from their young players to give hope that, perhaps, brighter days are ahead for Detroit basketball. — Collier",https://medium.com/@paolho/2021-nba-power-ratings-1f5de8430d56,['Paolo Sobretodo'],2022-01-02 08:28:38.689000+00:00,"['NBA', 'Sports Betting', 'Gambling']"
The Coverage of a Roulette Bet: The Math of Spreading Chips on the Table,"A couple of elements that make roulette such an attractive game of chance are the freedom that the players have in placing their bets and the wide range of possibilities for their bets to cover whatever numbers or groups of numbers on the roulette table. Thus, the question arises as to whether we should spread our chips arbitrarily or chaotically on the table (since we are allowed to do that) or somehow organize this combined betting in our favor. An immediate reason in favor of the latter alternative is technical.

Each roulette game has its own chip division in smaller amounts as well as a minimal and maximal stake required for some bets (for instance, an outside bet is likely to have a minimal stake required and a straight bet a maximal one). Therefore, a multiple placement of bets is constrained by such division and the house rules relative to the money management of the player. The smaller the division of chips, the more numbers we can cover with our multiple or combined bet relative to our wagering fund.

However, this is not the only reason for a convenient organization of our betting. Other reasons are provided by the mathematics of roulette, which provides the criteria of such organization as well.

Placements, Sets of Numbers, and Coverage of a Roulette Bet

We call a placement any choice to place a simple bet (straight up, split, street, etc.) on the roulette table for one spin in regard to numbers by putting the chip or chips in one place, according to the game rules. For simple bets, we have 154 possible placements (one bet-one placement). However, if we count all placements for all possible bets, including the multiple placements of the combined bets, we get a huge number, namely, 2^154. This is actually the number of possible choices for a bet regardless of the stake.

If we identify a placement with the set of numbers in that placement, roulette becomes a good provider of exercises for students who learn about sets in their math class. This is because placements can be exclusive or intersect one another and can be joined as unions or partitioned. The set of numbers that a bet is placed on is called the coverage of that bet. For instance, the coverage of a split bet on 18 and 21 ( spl (18, 21)) is the set {18, 21}, which has two elements; the coverage of a bet on red is the set of all red numbers, counting 18 elements.

As for a combined bet, its coverage is defined as the union of all the placements of the simple bets it consists of. For example, the coverage of the combined bet B consisting of a bet on the first column and the street bet on (4, 5, 6) (denote it by B = (1 stC, str (4, 5, 6))) is the set {1, 4, 5, 67, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34}, which has 14 elements, of which one (4) belongs to both constituent bets. The number of elements of a coverage A is called the length of A and is the cardinal of set A (the number of elements in A), denoted by | A|.

It is clear now that the length of the coverage of a bet accounts for the probability of winning that bet, which is the ratio between | A| and 37 or 38, depending on the type of roulette you are playing, either American or European roulette. In our previous example, the probability of winning bet B in European roulette is 14/37 = 37.83%.

Mathematical Constraints for Arbitrary Coverage

With the abovementioned formula for probability, one can easily derive that the larger the coverage of a bet, the higher the probability of winning the bet. Therefore, is filling up the roulette table with all kinds of bets just to cover as many numbers as possible (or as our wagering fund supports) a valid strategy? Not at all. Probability is not the only criterion for choosing one bet or another, and coverage is not the only parameter of a bet. If they were, roulette would be the paradise of gambling since it offers the possibility of bets with over a 90% probability of winning.

First of all, arbitrary placements just aiming at a large coverage may result in no profit whatever the outcome of the game. They are what we call contradictory bets. No one is supposed to place such bets; for instance, betting together $1 on each of the black numbers, 17$ on red, and $1 on zero will always result in either a loss (−$2) or zero profit, whatever number the ball will land on. The possible profit (or loss) of a bet is given by the profit function of that bet, and a first constraint for combined bets with large coverage is that their profit function should be positive for at least one outcome in that coverage.

However, some non-contradictory bets should be avoided or improved. These are bets whose coverages overlap. For example, take the bet (2ndC, cor (8, 9, 11, 12)) on the second column and on the corner with 8, 9, 10, and 11. The placements of those two simple bets overlap on numbers 8 and 11. Regardless of the stakes, the first observation is that having those two numbers in both coverages decreases the probability of winning for that combined bet in the sense that if one chooses another corner bet exclusive of the second column or another column bet exclusive of the initial corner bet, the probability of winning would increase with 2/37 or 2/38, while the investment remains the same.

The ideal outcome for this bet-in which 8 or 11 are hit, thus making the highest profit-does not justify the initial choice either; first, the probability of that happening is low, and second, if there is such a big confidence in any of those two numbers coming up, the player may place a bet separately on them, as a split or double straight-up bet, while excluding them from one placement (choosing another corner bet instead). In terms of investment, it is reasonable to save from the stake invested for a double covering of 8 and 11 and place another bet instead with that saved money.

From the book Roulette Odds and Profits — The Mathematics of Complex Bets.

Hence, as a general criterion of organization of combined betting in regard to placements, the coverages of the bets should be partitioned (that is, to have mutually exclusive placements that are joined together as the total coverage) as there is no mathematical or practical reason to overlap the placements.

Coverage and Bets with the Same Parameters

Take the following two bets: a split bet and a bet consisting of two straight-up bets on the same numbers as in the split bet-for instance, spl (4, 5) and (strg (4), strg (5)). The two bets have the same coverage {4, 5} and therefore the same probability of winning. Let’s see the expectation for each bet, say, in American roulette.

For the split bet, assuming a stake S, if 4 or 5 are hit, the profit is 17 S and otherwise (as a loss) is − S; for the double straight-up bet, if one assumes stake S on each straight-up bet, the possible profit would be 34 S or −2 S (the loss). The expected values of the two bets are − S/19 and −2 S/19, respectively. In all these calculations, the payout of each simple bet as well as the probabilities of winning and losing were involved.

Now observe that if we halve the stake of the split bet ( S) and bet it on each straight-up bet ( S/2) of the combined bet, we have the same possible profit, the same possible loss, the same investment, and the same expected value on the same sets of numbers as outcomes. These are what we call equivalent bets.

Of course, that split bet is equivalent to any other split bet with a different placement and with the same stake. This example is trivial, but there are equivalent bets of any complexity among those 2^154 possible placements. Obviously, two equivalent bets have the same length of their coverages. The converse is not true as equivalence is defined through the profit function and, as such, also depends on stakes.

As a mathematical entity, a roulette bet is identified by its placements and the (partial) stakes associated with these placements (the payouts are implicit as each placement of a simple bet has a certain payout). Once we know that there are equivalent bets with the same total stake but different placements or with the same coverage but with different partial stakes, that total number of possible placements no longer seems so huge.

When choosing our bet, apart from confirming that it is not contradictory or does not have overlapping placements, we can also choose among several bets that are equivalent to it. The reasons for such a choice are related to everyone’s strategy of betting and can be either subjective or objective.

For instance, a subjective reason is related to the fact that numbers do not have the same status on the roulette table as they have on the wheel. Numbers 17 and 20 can be covered by a split bet, while 17 and 23 cannot; the only simple bet that can cover numbers 1 and 35 is the odd bet; instead, numbers 1 and 2 can be covered by many inside bets, while numbers 1 and 26 cannot be covered with one placement. Such examples argue for the necessity of choosing among bets, and this means organization.

If a player wants to cover his or her favorite numbers for some subjective reasons with bets of certain types and under a certain strategy, s/he is supposed to choose among types of bets and equivalent bets. There are also practical reasons for such choices. For instance, a player has limited time to place the chips before the next spin, so manipulating many chips of different values for a bet that assumes placing chips physically on many numbers or placements might result in not having all the chips placed until the next spin. In that case, it is recommended for that bet to be replaced with one equivalent to it, requiring fewer placements.

The important thing to note is that in roulette, betting coverage is important, but it is not the only factor that accounts for an objective analysis of the bets in relation to the player’s personal strategy. In fact, in roulette, the only strategy is that of choosing (placing bets is a choice) and adjusting the stakes of those bets to fit personal money management and objectives. The mathematics of roulette not only helps in organizing your bets such that your choice would be objective but also is the only provider of such objectivity.",https://medium.com/@cb_67963/the-coverage-of-a-roulette-bet-the-math-of-spreading-chips-on-the-table-d300f51ee653,['Catalin Barboianu'],2022-01-04 07:27:41.088000+00:00,"['Roulette', 'Gambling Mathematics', 'Casino Games', 'Gambling', 'Roulette Mathematics']"

Comparing The Parallels of Madhubala And Marilyn Monroe | Vacuum,"There’s a line from the Beatles’ song ‘Baby You’re a rich man,’ How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people.

Madhubala died from a hole in her heart that took this beautiful goddess from us at 36. Norma Jean died of a drug overdose at the age of 36, speculated to be a suicide. Popularly known as Marilyn Monroe, she was deemed one of the most beautiful actresses that graced the silver screen. Similarly, Madhu bala was often referred to as ‘Marilyn of the Hindi Film Industry,’ which was an understatement considering her immense popularity and unique personality independent of any other.

She was undoubtedly a great actress blessed with a divine beauty that left the audience stunned and kept their eyes glued for the duration she was on screen. She was a great Indian actress, lauded by fans and wanted by many film producers for her comic timing, natural beauty, and choosing roles that challenged societal norms. At a point, people started calling her action queen Madhubala as she did all kinds of roles in her career.

Marilyn started with modeling and making her way into the movies in Hollywood. She was immediately termed as ‘Blonde Bombshell .’ She was among the highest-paid actresses of Hollywood at the time. Rumors surrounding her death still bring several conspiracies among her fans. Madhubala was among the highest-paid actresses in Indian Cinema and her role as Anarkali, a dancer in Mughal Emperor’s court, is among her best works. Madhubala and Marilyn Monroe share something between them that is beyond their beauty, tragic life, and complicated relationships.

Madhubala’s Beginnings in The Indian Film Industry

As she was called fondly by her friends and colleagues, Madhu was born in 1933 in a Pashtun family. Her father worked in a tobacco factory, and she started developing a keen interest in performing arts, often performing in front of her family. She was gorgeous and soon began making appearances in Indian movies. She landed a role in Basant that was released in 1942. Her name was changed to Madhubala when she graced the screen with Raj Kapoor in Neel Kamal.

She worked alongside big stars of that time, working in comic roles in movies like Mr. And Mrs. 55, where she played Anita, an heiress to her father’s fortune required to marry before she turns 21. Her aunt hires Preetam (Guru Dutt) for a sham marriage. In Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi, she played Renu, a dreamy-eyed girl who is charming and wonderful. Her song with Kishore, Ek Ladki Bheegi Bhaagi Si, is one of the most memorable melodies. She played Kishore Kumar’s love interest in Half Ticket. Later Kishore Kumar and Madhubala eloped and stayed married until her death.

Anarkali And Her Enchanting Charm Graced The Silver Screen And Gave Her The Most Memorable Role to Date

Her most significant role is Anarkali in Mughal-E-Azam, opposite Dilip Kumar and veteran actor Prithviraj Kapoor.

It was when an off-screen romantic relationship developed between Dilip Kumar and Madhubala, which she described as the happiest time of her life.

She was snubbed by awards for her role but remained a memorable presence playing the love interest of Salim.

She was gazed upon wherever she went, flirted playfully, and stayed away from the limelight, rarely giving interviews.

Stressing the importance of happiness, she placed it over being beautiful.

Marilyn Monroe’s Troubled Childhood And Her Way Into Mainstream Success

Marilyn Monroe’s mother was confined to an asylum, and foster families raised her, some of them being terrible aggressors towards the little girl she was. After starting modeling assignments, she was signed by 20th-century fox and started her career in movies, changing her name to Marilyn Monroe.

After making cameos for a few films, she found new fame with All About Eve in 1950, which she followed with Love Nest, Gentlemen prefer Blondes, How to Marry a Millionaire(1953), and Show Business (1954).

Later she ventured into doing comedy roles in the movie Bus Stop. She portrayed an ambitious cafe singer Cherie with dreams of Hollywood in her eyes.

The Seven Year Itch featured as a Femme Fatale neighbor to Tom Ewell’s character, bored of his relationship.

The film featured her iconic white gown on a subway vent as the moving train blew her dress away.

This scene has been referenced several times in history, a pop-culture gem, most popularly at Jack Rabbit Slim’s diner where you can see the waitresses in the outfit of stars of golden years.

Billy Wilder’s Some Like it Hot come 1959 is the comedy that gave Monroe recognition as an actress and a memorable performance. The film was a box office hit and considered one of the greatest films of the 20th century.

Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio

Marilyn had troubled relationships throughout her life, starting with marriage to factory worker James Dougherty when she was just 21. She later married baseball star, Joe DiMaggio. Marilyn had a string of affairs, including director Elia Kazam and Marlon Brando’s tie’s Arthur Miller was the man in line, they married, and he wrote The Misfits for her, her last screen appearance.

In May 1962, she sang ‘Happy Birthday, Mr. President,’ in the event of President John F Kennedy’s birthday celebration in Madison Square Garden.

Her mood swings and failed marriages were huge reasons behind the troubled life she led. During the last days of her life, she was a recluse and stayed inside. She checked into a ward and found herself surrounded by lunatics, DiMaggio came and discharged her from the hospital, and their friendship blossomed again. She was found dead in August 1962, the cause of death being a drug overdose.

Madhu Bala’s Love Life And Marriage to Kishore Kumar

Madhubala had her first relationship with actor Premnath, which ended shortly afterward, but they remained lifelong friends. During the shoot of Mughal-E-Azam, she came close to Dilip Kumar, and their relationship started. They were engaged and married soon, but Madhu’s father was against it. He put a condition ahead of Kumar, that if he wants to marry his daughter, he will only work in movies her father produced. Dilip Kumar, a star often called ‘The Tragedy King,’ declined and married Saira Bano.

Kishore Kumar, who had worked earlier with Madhubala, asked for marriage with him which she accepted, she was severely ill during the time, and Kishore was aware of that. She died in 1969 after a long period of illness. Her last film was Jwala with Sunil Dutt, released after her death.

We have also talked about the legendary life of Kishore Kumar here.

The Timeless Charm of Madhubala And Marilyn Monroe Echoes Till Date in Popular Culture

Madhubala has remained a cultural icon and an epitome of natural beauty, referenced countless times in Hindi movies, and actresses like Madhuri Dixit emulate her style. Similarly, Marilyn’s face is etched in people’s memories to date. A film based on her life, My Week With Marilyn, was released in 2011, starring Michelle Williams in the titular role. Nicole Kidman performed her version of Monroe’s ‘Diamonds are a girl’s best friend’ in Baz Luhrmann’s Moulin Rouge.

Madhubala and Marilyn Monroe had parallels between them. One is the most famous cultural icon and sex symbol and parodied to date. Another was an actress who made a place in her fans’ hearts through her beauty and charm and is still the most beautiful actress in India or the Hindi film industry.

If someone creates a list of the top 10 Indian actresses or the best actresses ever, we are sure that Madhu and Marilyn will hold the top places.

Her enigmatic personality and playful acting still reside in our hearts and stay fresh in our memory. Both had painful lives despite being loved by everyone around them and in the film industry.

They were timeless, but any comparison between them would be wrong. Madhubala and Marilyn Monroe were unique personas that stand independent of any comparison and remain the biggest artists of their generation.",https://medium.com/@vacuummag/comparing-the-parallels-of-madhubala-and-marilyn-monroe-vacuum-caef78e193d7,['Vacuum Magazine'],2022-01-22 09:31:00.760000+00:00,"['Marilyn Monroe', 'Bollywood', 'E Magazine', 'Madhubala', 'Hollywood']"

When we first started the thought of StrongNode we looked outside to see what we can do to help solve some of the world’s problems. Last year wasn’t any joke and now we have a pandemic on our hands. We went to our clientele and saw what keeps them up at night. We noticed that the cost of computing has gone up, these cloud providers have a foothold on us and they know it. With that said, we had to come up with a solution or an alternative and looking inwards of what is available we noticed that we already had the blueprint already in front of us in the form of Open Source.

We wanted to address the last mile, which is the EDGE. It’s the consumers’ latent resources from your PC/MAC/LINUX [environment] (CPU, bandwidth, storage) and use it for a batch processing cluster using the map/reduce method of sorting jobs and processing it with a token economic incentive to participate both as a broadcaster and a receiver.

We wanted to grow the digital footprint of our decentralized distributed network and to be able to get token distribution to as many wallets as possible which will, in the long term, help the value of the $SNE token.

The StrongNode $SNE token has so many use cases within the StrongNode ecosystem which includes our innovation lab projects focused on gaming, social impact, entertainment, lifestyle platforms building on the StrongNode Edge technology. You get paid for your idle resources and others get to run workloads, processed in chunks, on your idle resources. In return, you get paid in StrongNode tokens [$SNE] when you lend your network and compute resources. There are more mechanics yet to be announced that will enhance the appeal of token adoption.

USER PROTECTION and PRIVACY

User Protection and Privacy has become an issue that many projects face in their development. Can you explain the security of the StrongNode and how the StrongNode protects its users?

Daniel Saito: As a former security analyst, researcher and developer; I was originally tasked at designing the framework for the trusted mobile platform using a TPM or otherwise known in today’s term as “secure enclave” in 4G devices with NTT DoCoMo R&D, Intel and IBM. I want to take the same principle but also apply it to the anonymous / cryptographic model of crypto and create the ultimate solution in network and privacy where the user add value and in return they receive a monetary reward.

As for privacy, we only know you by your wallet address at any time. All personal KYCd data will be stored offsite with our KYC authentication partners. You will need to be properly KYCd to join the StrongNode Network. We plan to not only have Audit certificates but we also plan to use 3rd party services to attack our network, have bug bounties, and most of all it will be OPEN SOURCE (even that will be all audited).

In order to help this process, we reinvented OpenID. This is our SSO (Single Sign On) approach like “Login with Google” or “Login with Facebook” to validate you as a user to enter the network. Upon completing the KYC component at User Registration, not only do we airdrop you $SNE tokens, but you also get this nifty NFT dropped into your wallet. This NFT is specific to your wallet address and your identity, which cannot be moved out of your wallet. This NFT acts as an access token (a key) to login to various crypto properties that we are working on in our innovation labs. We want to use best of breed open source projects and develop StrongNode with the tech.

Security and anonymity are always prioritized by BlockChain projects in the development of project platforms and technologies. So, do you have any technological solutions or plans to enhance user trust in these issues?

Daniel Saito: Yes, we took extra constraints to ensure data sovereignty distribute our MASTER nodes in locations where GOV’T have strict regulatory on user privacy and encryption.

This is the next era of where and how data is stored. Cloud makes things easy, but if the provider is a USA-based corporation. The US government will have access to that data.

Daniel Saito: Please join us and grow Vietnam’s digital footprint on StrongNode.

Part Four | Harbors You’re Seeing For The First Time,"Vietnam. Photo by Nia Outis.

Ch. 15 | I was teaching English in a city tucked up near the Chinese border.

I had arrived late at night after thirty hours in transit from L.A., including a three-hour layover in Seoul, then easy soaring above a wool pelt all the way to Hanoi; a five-hour wait in the latter city’s central bus station, for intake by the school rep; and a seven-hour comfy, cozy, jouncing ride 300 km northwest by sleeper bus—half-reclining bunk beds stretched three rows across the length of a neon-lit interior.

The ESL academy where I would work owned two buildings twenty minutes walking distance from each other: a center with classrooms, and a hostel. Both buildings housed salaried Vietnamese teachers and foreign-volunteer guest teachers, and backpackers (non-volunteers).

Only a few details matter much on a journey such as mine. Is the mattress hard? Are the showers hot? Please God, is the toilet Western? Here, the answer to these three questions was yes.

I lived at the center for starters. It was located on a noisy, polluted road. The cramped, messy women’s dorm, through whose open window an acrid smell seeped, afforded no privacy. Worse, its second-floor window glanced into the city’s most popular dog meat restaurant.

Within the week, I had moved to the hostel, which was located on a much quieter, residential street.

My only regret was relocating 25 minutes away by foot from an upscale coffee house perched atop one bank of Song Lo (the River Lo). The air quality was fresh and delicious there—a quick escape from traffic-clogged streets.

Lyrical Vietnamese pop music played in the background; behind the music, the soft rush of traffic and muted honking of horns. (Drivers there loved to honk, and must, because there wasn’t much sticking to invisible lanes or obeying the few red lights. People drove slowly and considerately and boy did they have good reflexes.)

Sipping strong coffee served with a complimentary cookie and small glass of sugar cane juice, I half sang to myself: “Heh-éllp me, I think I’m fah-áhl-ing in luh-uv again.”

#

Each Vietnamese ESL teacher entered the classroom accompanied by a native English-speaking volunteer who helped with pronunciation, spelling, and so forth. This was apparently a nationwide government initiative.

The academy director assigned me classes from 2–4:30 PM in the public elementary schools.

The teachers and volunteers traveled to the public schools by moped, but moped was not for me. I tried it the first day. The young teacher drove and I rode pillion. Thin plastic helmets, yes, but kneepads no. I loved the cool air rushing past my knees but kept thinking shattered kneecaps.

In Vietnam, elders are accorded respect like nowhere else. After that first day, the considerate director assigned me the nearest elementary school in walking distance.

The kids were charming, curious, and bright. At the start of each lesson, they stood and sang “Hello, Teacher.” They were already writing well in tiếng Việt, and copying short English sentences from the blackboard, and their penmanship (using fountain pens) was beautiful. Between lessons, they poured into a schoolyard noisy and cheerful, with bright yellow, orange, and red floral banners strung across it.

#

The city’s buildings combined Vietnamese, Chinese, and French-colonial styles.

The tube houses reached far back of the street as in Amsterdam. These tall and narrow old houses hid deep interiors: tiled floors, steep stairways, spacious rooms, and French doors leading onto balconies.

Many industrious families had turned their front room—behind which lay their living room, furnished with high-backed, varnished and sometimes inlaid, wooden throne-benches and chairs (they didn’t upholster as in the West)—into commercial space: ma-and-pa markets; shops selling kitchen goods, linens, clothing, shoes; kiosks serving street food. Along the main thoroughfares, these shop houses mixed with designated commercial establishments.

Many decorative house facades were painted colorfully, in pastels, but many of the buildings’ raw flanks were damp, moldy, uncared for. The A-line roofs mirrored the surrounding, steep green mountains.

My new home was located in one such, old-fashioned tube house.

My new dorm was less cramped—only eight bunk beds, two per rectangular-boxlike steel frame, and more space between the two rows. Each bunk featured a wide mattress, and pale green grommet curtains for privacy. When with a satisfying grating sound, you slid shut both perforated fabric panels along the curtain rod, you lived inside your own tiny room, high-ceilinged enough to sit up and get dressed in, wide enough to do yoga, equipped with interior clothing hooks at the foot of the bed frame and, near its head, a strong lamp and an electrical socket.

I would awake with the neighborhood’s roosters, several hours earlier than the building or the street, and huff up a flight of stairs to the rooftop showers.

Then downstairs to the kitchen to cook breakfast. The hostel supplied complimentary bread rolls and duck eggs, and sometimes I saved vegetables from dinner that could be stirred into an omelette.

The academy director’s husband brought me steamed rice, greens, and cabbage or mushrooms for lunch and dinner to spare me a 4x/day walk to and from the center, to which the other hostel residents raced by moped for meals prepared by a hired cook who sautéed the vegetables in lard and often served pork.

The hostel kitchen where I cooked breakfast and washed my dishes was also far from ideal. A plumbing problem had rendered the sink unusable. The local youngster managing the hostel cooked for paying guests in greasy, blackened frying pans and washed the dishes in the adjacent bathroom sink beside the shower and toilet.

I solved the issue by purchasing personal kitchen things that I stored beneath my bunk: an apron, a pot and frying pan, a wooden spoon and spatula, a bowl and chopsticks and mug, several plastic storage containers, a dish sponge, a dish cloth and hand towel, a roll of disposable cleaning towels, and a plastic tub that fit the kitchen-sink rim just below the faucet.

I boiled water in the kitchen kettle, and used that (not the bathroom’s hot tap water, as the young manager did) to wash and rinse my dishes. I poured the dirty soap suds down the loo.

I regretted not having brought a supply of peanut butter and canned sardines from L.A. to supplement the food provided by the director. Instead, I bought bananas and, in quantity, raw peanuts (to fry in olive oil and then store) and tofu (to fry in olive oil and sautéed onion and then freeze). I shopped for these at the wet market near the river.

Caged poultry, and live fish swimming in plastic tubs, were sold there, but by avoiding the central food market, at least I spared myself the sight of live pigs for sale and even, oh never mind, I won’t say it again.

#

The city was small enough that people could walk or bicycle it, but almost no one did. They hopped on mopeds to go a distance of even five minutes through dusty streets.

Almost everyone wore masks against the raw exhaust spewing from mostly mopeds, some cars, some trucks, the occasional bus.

I would learn that mopeds are this poor but highly mobile country’s primary means of transportation. Open fires on urban or village streets, or in the countryside, whether to burn garbage, cook meals outdoors, or incinerate the symbolic paper houses and vehicles and money that, in mourning rituals, accompany the dead, added to the chronic assault on the air’s purity.

Within two weeks of arrival, my priceless capacity for taking deep breaths practically down to the navel had become compromised. I did as in Rome and bought a face mask. It looked like a single, padded bra cup with elastic ear loops.

And perhaps I told you about the sidewalks? No one used them as sidewalks! Private motorbikes and motorbikes for hire used them as parking spaces.

Front stoops, each with a short metal ladder centrally placed, led from homes to a swath of brick-colored, geometrically incised sidewalk tiles that would be pretty if not in disrepair; then a strip of thick concrete rectangles, many with rusted iron handles; then the roadway. Many of these concrete rectangles were cracked or broken, or having been dislodged, revealed gaping holes.

At first, I had wrongly surmised that people wiped their shoe soles against the ladder rungs. In fact, the ladder served for wheeling one’s moped or bicycle from the front room onto the sidewalk or vice versa.

All told, it was treacherous to navigate the sidewalks. The few pedestrians usually walked in the road amid vehicular traffic, and I followed suit. Vigilantly. This was not a city where one flânered; I did so only along the riverfront, and only after having safely negotiated streets and crosswalks on the way.

#

Not all work-exchange hosts are friendly or honor the informal contract’s cultural-exchange aspect—in fact, strip away the rhetoric, and travel’s glamor, and volunteers can find themselves mere itinerant laborers in the global gig economy—but the academy director was exceptionally generous with regard to sharing her culture.

One day, she welcomed her Vietnamese teachers and international TAs to her ancestral village of smallholdings: cornfields, vegetable plots, and terraced rice paddies against a rugged, mountainous backdrop.

Farm women, wading deep in mud, at that season labored at stirring up the mud or flattening the surface with bamboo poles.

Water buffalo pasturing, chickens and ducks in the yards, dogs with hanging teats (from multiple litters) slouching along the unpaved streets, yapping fur-ball puppies—but about them, I was afraid to ask.

She ushered us across a short, gracefully arched stone bridge leading to a handsome stilt house. This enlarged and renovated farmhouse and the land had been in the family for generations, she said.

The honey-colored timber used to construct the farmhouse now was rare, she added; people weren’t allowed to fell those trees to build homes anymore.

The spacious, minimally furnished dwelling featured carved walls, a polished hardwood floor, and soaring, exposed thatch ceiling. Springlike air ventilated the whole of the interior through rectangular window piercings that rose from floor level and framed verdant countryside.

The hostess, a relative, invited us to sit on reed mats in lotus position in a circle, with various dishes placed on a round pewter tray at the hub. Being the eldest volunteer, I was invited to sit with the aunts (women in their early eighties). I ate only rice, eggs, and vegetables—and used my personal chopsticks in this, a meat-eating culture.

We drank fermented-fruit alcohol from shot glasses. Strong stuff that tingled going down! I only sipped and unlike the aunties, who knocked it back, never made it to the bottom of the first shot.

We ate bananas for dessert and drank tea. Then we chewed betel—I would do that only this once, I decided, for the experience. The eldest aunt took a leaf, sprinkled onto it a dash of powdered limestone, placed the betel nut atop the white powder, and tightly wrapped the leaf around it—then you chew, coating your teeth with plant fiber and releasing a red juice that stains.

Despite ground-down, blackened teeth, the elderly aunts were beautiful. Their smiles were good-natured and warm. Each wore a thick gold bracelet and delicate gold earrings. The one whose pale-pink silk blouse I admired had only stopped working the land three years ago, she said (holding up three fingers while the director translated). Now she was enjoying the great-grandchildren.

#

The 15-day Tet (Lunar New Year) school vacation had arrived. This was serendipitous; I had not timed my visit to coincide with it.

The breezes were balmy. I walked to and from the river and crossed the bridge to Ho Chi Minh Square, or would sit out on my dorm-room balcony. I would look up from reading to admire the next door neighbors’ balcony garden, listen to their caged songbirds, and sweet-talk their cat, or my gaze would follow the flickering, swirling flight paths of mating white and yellow butterflies.

The director again took her salaried staff and TAs to her ancestral village, this time to a modest home, for a festive meal in the company of her extended, multigenerational family.

A local TV station filmed the event, to be broadcast just before Tet’s start. I was wearing the school’s bright red logo tee shirt and was more or less coerced to participate in a segment in which, for the camera, several of us ladled pork stew onto serving plates. The idea was that villagers were sharing culinary customs with international volunteers.

Of course I didn’t eat the stew, but nevertheless felt that I had compromised myself. After that part of the filming ended, I scooted past an enormous, cooked boar’s head and trotters displayed on a round, pewter platter on the floor, and down the back ladder stairs to scrub my hands in cleanser under an outdoor tap above a bucket.

Another day, the director took me with her to a friend’s village to pick up several chickens. The prosperous farmwife warmly welcomed us, inviting us to drink tea on her patio and to admire her flowering peach trees and kitchen garden.

Then we followed her into a fenced yard where chickens pecked and puppies gamboled.

(A volunteer once told me that during the civil war, starving people ate anything that moved. And also, there were those who kept dogs as pets, hiding them indoors or behind gates to protect them from the trade.)

The farmwife expertly snatched up three chickens one after another, folded the wings in order to streamline each bird and fit it through a round hole in an oblong, bamboo cage, then knotted the hole closed using a length of bamboo string. The chickens did not appear agitated, and after she had placed a plastic canvas bag over the cage, became silent.

#

As holiday eve approached, public excitement mounted. The municipality planted red flags along all streets and boulevards. Gift baskets filled with cookies, candy, wine, and cigarettes appeared in shopfronts. Vendors of traditional, potted peach and orange trees appeared on major street corners. Drivers toting flowering peach trees on the back of their mopeds sped by.

On the day of holiday eve, the boulevard bordered on one side by the Bookstore (which sold everything—textbooks and school supplies, pots and pans and utensils, coffee and condiments, sunscreen and mosquito repellant, hats and sunglasses), and on the other by the entrance to the wet market, hosted a street fair hawking flowers, tinsel and tasseled prayers for decorating the potted trees, gift baskets, fruit, and so much more. It was jammed with moped and pedestrian traffic squeezing past each other as people made their final purchases.

The next day, we few remaining volunteers accompanied the director to the pagoda where the townspeople had gathered to pray to the Buddha and the ancestors. The day after, we again accompanied her to her ancestral village, visited the homes of relative after relative after relative, and ate and ate and ate.

On the third day, I popped into her bathroom to wash my hands before dinner with the family. On the floor beside the toilet bowl rested the oblong cage, now holding only two chickens, who had poked their heads and outstretched necks through the mesh and were unconcernedly nipping cooked rice from a kitchen plate. Innocents.

“I’m really sorry, you guys,” I whispered.

#

My having been introduced to the pagoda, it become my urban oasis. It yielded much of beauty—red lacquerwork, Chinese lettering, gilding, the intricately incised, carved, or sculpted stone and wood of staircases and balustrades and doors and columns and rafters and rooftops, and of the tens of Buddhas, and of always another dragon or phoenix or turtle; much of awe—the grand stone staircase leading from the courtyard to the prayer complex, the main prayer hall’s lofty wooden ceiling; much that charmed—altars piled high with flowers and fruit and cake and tinned or packaged cookies, pyramids of bottled water and canned soft drinks and beer, a simple plate of boiled eggs.

The many silver-haired nuns, and several monks, clad in dark-brown linen pajama suits, seamlessly accepted the regular presence of us few Westerners at their morning services, in which rhythmic prayers uttered in a language mysterious to our ears were accompanied by the beating of a hollow, rounded, varnished wooden temple block and punctuated by the ringing of chimes and gongs.

Once settled into lotus, I engaged in mindful mishmash—Hebrew prayers followed by meditation on certain resonant Buddhist concepts. Really, at this stage in life, whatever works.

I witnessed (ignorant of the ceremonial purpose) but one instance of sartorial flamboyance—a monk garbed in a saffron yellow satin robe whose wide, pink collar-and-lapels became two loose and flowing satin ribbons.

The chanting changed in pitch; I opened my eyes. The monk performed a sacred, hypnotic dance in place, golden robe swirling, rose-pink ribbons floating, hands and long fingers delicately gesturing in time with the vocal and percussive rhythms that rose and fell about him.",https://medium.com/what-these-ithakas-mean/part-four-harbors-youre-seeing-for-the-first-time-70e65f92aa5f,['Nia Outis'],2022-01-10 12:24:55.650000+00:00,"['Work', 'Travel', 'Vietnam']"
From the Archives: A Day in My Life Teaching in Hanoi,"“Wait, 20 hours a week is full time there?!” This is the standard reaction I get when I tell people from home that I work 19 hours a week, slightly below “full time” status for foreign teachers in Vietnam. Most people cannot fathom that I’m able to work half of the typical work week in the US, live comfortably, and even save money if I budget correctly (lol hi dad, I’m getting better at this I promise!!).

On top of being confused about how it’s possible for me to survive working 20 hours per week, people are also curious about what I do during the free time that I have when I’m not working. As I just recently hit my four month anniversary of living in Hanoi, I can finally say that I’ve established a schedule and I feel like I’m living a relatively normal life here. Of course there are random occurrences and mishaps that likely wouldn’t happen back in the U.S. that are often sprinkled into my days, but here’s a look into a typical day in my life as a teacher in Vietnam!

8:00- Wake up and get ready

Hanoi is a city for early birds (literally and figuratively). Roosters serve as the city’s alarm clocks, and the people respond accordingly. Around 6 A.M., construction begins, street vendors call out to potential customers, and the honking resumes. Despite the commotion ensuing outside my window, I block it all out and savor every moment of shut eye that I can get.

In an ideal world, I’d do as the Hanoians do and utilize my late start to wake up and go on a run or journal or do something else productive. But realistically, I press snooze until the last possible second, freak out when I realize I didn’t turn on my hot water heater and I still need to shower, and rush around to prepare for my day. All the while, I try to FaceTime family and friends because it’s evening at home which is the most convenient time to catch up with everyone. With minutes to spare, I scarf down a bowl of cereal (still not eating pho for breakfast like the locals), run out the door, and enter the madness.

9:20- Drive my motorbike to my morning job

The commute to my morning school is fairly tame so I’m comfortable driving myself there. If it’s raining outside, I leave a bit earlier due to the increased insanity on the streets (picture flooded roads and hundreds of motorbike drivers wearing rain ponchos that completely block any peripheral vision). On days when the weather is nice, I find myself actually enjoying the drive (which is major progress seeing that I was initially terrified by the idea of ever driving in Hanoi)!!

9:45- Teach at my morning school

My morning job is at a bilingual school which means that the students are fluent in both Vietnamese and English, and they learn all of their subjects in both languages. I teach math and science to a 2nd grade class (25 students) from 10:00–11:30 daily.

I try to get to school 15 minutes early to set up my PowerPoint, gather material, and to prepare myself for the impending insanity. Then, for the next hour and a half, I run around taking away Pokémon cards from distracted students, reminding antsy kids to sit nicely and stop talking, and figuring out how to appropriately react to questions like, “What the hell happened to our Christmas tree?” (Yes, one of my 2nd graders really did ask that, and that’s not even the worst of what I’ve heard). With the remaining few minutes left of class, I try my best to ensure that the students are actually learning a little math and science.

11:30- Free time

After a whole hour and a half of teaching, I have a five hour break. On a typical, lazy day, this break serves as time for me to go out to lunch, work on lesson plans, and take a nap. On more productive days, I use this time to explore Hanoi, run errands, or continue my spa tour of Hanoi. I am also beginning to take Vietnamese lessons so I’ll be using a portion of this time to learn a new language! It’s unfortunate that just knowing how to say hello, thank you, and you’re handsome can only get you so far, but I am really excited to be learning more!

4:45- Take a Grab to my evening job

Since my other job is a bit further away from my house and I’m not yet comfortable driving at night time, I take a Grab to work in the evening. Grab is Vietnam’s version of Uber, and they have options for motorbike drivers, taxis, and even food delivery. Unless the weather outside is miserable, I get a Grab motorbike. Grab can be really hit or miss; drivers often get lost, drive as though they’re starring in Fast & Furious, and try to have full-fledged conversations with me in Vietnamese, but as long as I make it to work safely, I’m content.

6:00- Teach at my evening school

My second job is at a language center. Students attend language centers after school for additional English classes and tutoring. At this school, I teach phonics and reading. Depending on the day, I either work 6:00–7:30 or 6:00–9:00, hitting a total of 12 per week. The class sizes are smaller here (12 students maximum) and most of my students are 4–7 years old. It can be a little bit tricky to keep up with these kiddos’ energy levels, but I love how eager they are to learn English. It is overall a very rewarding job and a great work environment!

8:00/9:30- Relax

After work, I get another Grab and usually head home. Some weeknights, I’ll grab dinner with friends or go to events throughout the city. But more often than not, I head home, make a PB&J (or some other childish meal), turn on Netflix, and laugh about all the ridiculous things that happened throughout the day while preparing to do it all over again tomorrow.

Although teaching abroad can seem like it’s always weekend getaways to exotic places, daily adventures, and constant excitement, it is also maintaining a job, lesson planning, and making a life in a new place. As much as I love the more exciting aspects of teaching abroad, I am also really content with my job, the students I work with, the routine I’ve created, and my new home. Even on the boring days, there are lessons to be learned, challenges to overcome, and rich experiences to enjoy!",https://medium.com/@natbigelow/from-the-archives-a-day-in-my-life-teaching-in-hanoi-b3e7e006e5fa,['Nat Bigelow'],2022-01-22 09:59:24.977000+00:00,"['Teachers', 'Hanoi', 'Expat', 'Vietnam']"
How to Choose Tongue Bars Piercings,"The first step in getting a tongue bar piercing is to get the body part swollen. This swelling can make the tongue twice as thick as it normally is, but it will go away quickly. After this, you should change the bar as often as possible. A good place to start is with acrylic bars. Steel bars can be harmful to your teeth and gums, so you should always switch them out every few months.

Once you have had your tongue pierced, you can choose from many different styles and types of jewellery. The most popular tongue ring is a snake-eyes style that involves a horizontal bar that goes through the tip of the tongue. It is mostly painless and requires a little pressure to apply. You can choose a wide variety of styles to match your personal style. You can also choose from snake-eyes-styled rings with a larger hole.

Tongue bars can be made from a variety of materials. The most popular are acrylic and BioFlex. Both are plastic and are flexible. You can also wear retainers over them to keep them open. Regardless of the material, tongue piercing jewellery is a great choice for anyone who wants to add a unique and trendy accessory to their body. There are several styles and types to choose from.

Choosing a Type of Tongue Bar

When choosing a type of tongue bar, be sure to choose a barbell that is strong and does not cause excessive bleeding or swelling. The thinnest barbells will migrate and cause discomfort. Use a large, bulky, and flexible wholesale tongue bar. This will decrease the risk of pain and swelling. Once your tongue bar is secure, you can wear it with confidence. The pain is minimal and the ring will last for years.

The next step is choosing a barbell that is comfortable. The piercer will check your tongue for blood vessels before piercing. A barbell that is too long can damage intraoral structures. When choosing a tongue bar, it is crucial to select a piercing that is not too deep. It should be a one-time procedure. In addition to the length of the barbell, it is important to choose a piercing bar with a high degree of comfort.

Risks and Benefits of Having a Tongue Piercing

When choosing a tongue piercing, you should be aware of the risks and benefits of the procedure. You should expect to have a few blisters and bleeding afterward, so make sure that you choose one that is well-designed and comfortable. To keep the piercing area free of infection, the piercer should use a clean, soft-tissue cleaner to remove the excess blood. Once the healing process is complete, the initial barbell should be removed and replaced with a new barbell.",https://medium.com/@userpierced111/how-to-choose-tongue-bars-piercings-6dfcebabaeff,[],2022-01-04 05:21:24.479000+00:00,"['Jewelry', 'Body Piercing', 'Tongue Bars']"
Body Piercing Jewellery and Threaded Lip Retainers,"The most common materials used in Body Piercing Jewellery are borosilicate glass, fused quartz glass, obsidian glass, and gold. While these materials may not be biocompatible, they are lightweight and have a good color selection. Moreover, the biocompatibility of these materials helps them stay in the right place. However, you should take care of the piercing jewellery carefully to avoid the chances of it drying out or cracking.

Most metal body piercing jewellery contains a chemical known as PTFE, which can be dissolved and removed with the help of a sterile solution. PTFE is a biocompatible material that can be refined for medical use and is therefore biocompatible. The metal pieces used for Body Piercing Jewellery are usually fashioned from 316L surgical stainless steel, and some are even made from gold. For optimum results, the piercing jewellery should be hygienic.

Wooden Body Jewellery

For jewellery made of wood, it is best to avoid using oil made from edible products. Olive oil, and other such oils can go rancid and cause irritation. Grapeseed oil and jojoba oil are great for wood body jewellery, though there are cases when they are not suitable for some people. Similarly, beeswax is a safe alternative for wooden body jewellery and bone plugs. Beeswax is a biocompatible plastic that is lightweight and bendable. Unlike titanium, PTFE is not magnetic and is a great choice for retainers.

Choosing the right type of Jewellery

When choosing a type of jewellery, you should always choose one that has the highest safety rating. PTFE is an antiseptic and disinfectant that can be reinserted after a few weeks. PTFE is also made of implant-grade materials and is therefore biocompatible. When you choose your body piercing jewellery, make sure to choose only sterile and biocompatible materials. It is important to know that the right material for the body piercing will be safe for you.

If you’re planning to wear jewellery, make sure you have it professionally installed. The best way to prevent problems is to use a retainer to ensure that the piercing jewellery is secure and will not shift around. If you’re worried about this, you should consider having a piercing retainer. There are many benefits to this. This is a great option if you’re going to undergo a medical procedure.

Different Types of Body Piercing Jewellery

There are many different types of body piercing jewellery. Platinum is the most expensive metal and is, therefore, the most expensive. Although it’s not affordable, platinum can still be a great option for everyday wear. It’s also very hard, which makes it ideal for daily piercings. It’s also the most resistant material, but it’s not the most affordable. You can still buy it cheaply and get the same kind of jewellery as a friend’s.",https://medium.com/@userpierced111/body-piercing-jewelry-and-threaded-lip-retainers-2b16100cf85,[],2022-01-04 03:48:42.925000+00:00,"['Jewelry', 'Lip Retainers', 'Body Piercing', 'Body Jewelry']"

Nose Rings,"Nose Rings are thin rings that feature a bead on the end. Like labrets, they are inserted into the nostril from the inside. Despite the simplicity of the design, some nose rings pose a hygiene risk. They can be too large and can cause the piercing to snag. In cases where a piercing is already open, it is best to wait for it to heal before purchasing a nose ring.

A traditional nose ring is usually a ring. This long, seamless hoop fits into a hole in the septum. A curved barbell, or banana bar, holds the nose ring in place. The curved barbell is easily threaded through the hole by unscrewing the ball’s edges. Another type of nose piercing consists of a captive bead, which can be difficult to remove once inserted into the ear.

Nose rings are generally made from gold or silver. Real gold does not tarnish, and the base metal does not absorb its properties. Aside from gold, titanium is also a durable material that is often used for nose piercings. They are especially popular as a second piece of jewellery. The accents are the cherry on top. Nose rings have a distinctive look thanks to their design, so make sure you choose the right one!

While nose piercing jewellery is a great option, not everyone can wear it. There are several reasons why nose piercings are so popular. Whether you want to look stylish or feel like an alien from outer space, you will be surrounded by beautiful and attractive pieces of jewellery. You can even try on a nose stud or a hoop to find the perfect one for you. This way, you can change your piercing as often as you want.

Nose Studs

Nose studs are another popular style. They are shaped like a ring and fit into the hole of the nose. Usually, they are screw-type and are held in place by a curved barbell. Unlike a curved barbell, a ring is made of two or more metals. A hoop piercing is a good option if you’re prone to changing jewellery. A hoop piercing that is too small will irritate your skin.

Nose rings have many options for placement. The most common type is a ring, which is a long, seamless hoop that fits into the hole. It is held in place with a curved barbell (also known as a banana bar) that is threaded through the hole. Some curved barbells are made to be easy to remove or thread into the hole. The most popular style of a curved barbell is called a captive bead ring, which is a combination of a ring and a hoop.

The Versatility of Nose Rings

Nose rings are very versatile. They can be worn for a variety of reasons, including personal style or religious symbolism. Nose studs are especially popular in Asia and Africa. The styles and meanings of nose rings vary from culture to culture. The earliest earring was worn by the Romans. The best type is the one that suits you and your preferences. If you’re considering getting a pierced nose ring, it’s best to research what’s available.",https://medium.com/@userpierced111/nose-rings-bf7b08f20497,[],2022-01-04 05:30:56.413000+00:00,"['Jewelry', 'Nose Piercing', 'Nose Rings', 'Body Piercing']"
3D Printing is Ready to Transform Manufacturing Supply Chain,"Creator: MORENO SOPPELSA

Despite having captured the imaginations of technology enthusiasts and business strategists since the mid-1980s, 3D printing still isn’t the industry disrupting technology it has the promise to be. Much of the technology’s failure to launch has been due to slow printing speeds, lackluster quality, traceability issues, lack of talent, the high price of the most disruptive types of 3D printers, and the perception that it is little more than a hobby and prototyping tool. With the operating model transformation brought on by the Covid pandemic, things might be ready to change. Improvements to printing speeds and quality, the ascent of AI powered design tools, widespread post-pandemic digital adoption, and pressures to shorten and simplify the supply chain, more widespread adoption may be on the horizon. Now is a good time to start changing how manufacturing leaders view 3D printing and think about how it can transform their operating models.

Most western manufacturers have been dependent on low-cost overseas suppliers for items such as subcomponents, spare parts, jigs, tools, and fixtures for decades. The familiar low-cost country sourcing model comes with long lead times, little design flexibility and requires manufacturers to carry bulky inventory. On top of being a ridged and overly complicated model, companies are forced to absorb the cost of transportation and supplier markups. By adopting modern industrial 3D printing (in plastic and metals) many formerly sourced products can be produced in-house while still reducing costs and inventory. The value is a much simpler, cheaper, and agile supply chain.

There is already plenty of evidence of what the benefits might look like from industry users. Limited adoption and a number of recent proof-of-concepts have demonstrated its ability to reduce costs by up to 90% and deliver parts up to 48x faster for many tooling items, spare parts, and end-user components. Adoption also opens the door to a wide range of strategic benefits such as mass customization, on-demand manufacturing, rapid design iteration, and reduced administrative effort for sourcing, receiving and invoice handling.

Below we’ll look at a few ways industrial 3D printing can benefit manufacturers and list some potential use cases for consideration.

BENEFITS OF 3D PRINTING IN MANUFACTURING

Low-cost low volume production

3D printing is optimal for short production runs where a small number of specialized components or spare parts are needed. Manufacturers can produce the exact number of parts needed, with the exact amount of material required, from a multi-use inventory of raw material on site.

Faster delivery

Printing parts on-site can produce ready to use products in a matter of hours rather than days or longer when relying on a 3rd part supplier. Procurement action, supplier response, shipping, and receiving processes are all eliminated for all applicable parts.

Design flexibility

3D printed products require no special tooling. Designs can be iterated after each item is produced and the 3D printer will simply apply the changes to the next item. This allows improvements to be implemented almost immediately. AI powered ‘generative design’ software allows engineers to quickly produce new designs within whatever parameters they set, and even to combine subassemblies into single parts.

Mass customization

Design flexibility opens the possibility of offering customers highly customized products. This could be a differentiating capability for many customers. This also allows for much faster and customized production of some components for aftermarket sale, especially on low volume designs.

Lower inventory

Items that are appropriate for 3D printing are typically small but complex and take up a lot of space for their weight. ‘On-demand manufacturing’ with 3D printing allows users to only stock raw materials, while the product inventory exists as digital files. This can reduce warehouse space, loss due to damage, and handling needs.

Reduced administrative effort

Items produced in-house do not require administrative efforts such as sourcing capable suppliers, issuing purchase orders, warehouse receiving, and do not result in invoices which require additional back-office effort. These benefits will be most realized for highly customized items which typically require a lot of communication with suppliers.

CURRENT AND POTENTIAL USE CASES

3D printing is best suited for tooling needs, components in small to medium size production runs, and spare parts. Various printing technologies can print in metal or plastic, but the size of the machines means that the items must be relatively small. Common metals that are used include stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, cobalt chrome, and nickel alloys. You can consider some more details and constraints around metal printing here. Below are a few use cases for consideration:

· Tooling such as molds and inserts

· Rigid housings

· Ductwork

· Heat exchangers and heatsinks

· Spare parts

3D printing will become more and more commonplace as a manufacturing method in the coming years. As the technology gains wider adoption and improves, more products will fall into its purview. Users will benefit by shortening and simplifying their supply chains. Customers will benefit from much more rapid innovation and previously impossible levels of customization. At a higher level, 3D printing is part of a larger trend of AI fueled automated manufacturing, distributed production closer to the place of use, and mass customization. The future will be interesting.",https://medium.com/@jhirshman801/3d-printing-is-the-future-of-manufacturing-de544b4c7d59,['Joshua Hirshman'],2022-01-19 23:04:36.125000+00:00,"['Digital Transformation', 'Manufacturing', 'Supply Chain', '3D Printing', 'Technology Trends']"
Covid-19 and 3D printing. You might be wondering what exactly is…,"You might be wondering what exactly is the connection between Covid-19 and 3D printing. Well..let me explain you. Currently the world can be divided into 2 eras, namely Pre-Covid and Post-Covid.

Pre-Covid Era

The pre-Covid era where innovators and industries resided in a fancy lab or a garage experimenting their innovations. They took their own sweet time and cost which slowed the paced of innovations . Innovations such as 3D printing was present , however the applications of the same was limited , simply due to constraint in resources, infrastructure etc any manmade excuse of this sort.

Post-Covid Era

The Post-Covid Era is the era where common individuals and institutions were forced to innovate at a rapid pace in order to survive . In this era, mankind was not given the gift of time and they had to “innovate or die”. So as the cliched saying goes..necessity is the mother of invention , people took to their homes, offices and even streets to come up with innovative solutions and survive.

To be specific about 3D printing, the applications of 3D printing exploded in healthcare , pharmaceutical , automotive ,robotics, construction and other manufacturing industries. It also expanded by a wide range in education , jewelry and prototyping in general. The main reason for the former being contact less production and the others delve on the remote working concept.",https://medium.com/@lakshmi-shree24/covid-19-and-3d-printing-ef1d07ec727,['Lakshmi Shree'],2022-01-04 10:49:21.644000+00:00,"['Innovation', 'Coronavirus', 'Manufacturing', 'Healthcare', '3D Printing']"
"Makers Next Door: Meet Designer-Artist, Bao Songyu","Taking Inspiration From Nature

In 2019, Bao came in first place in NTU’s Singapore Global Digital Art Prize with his final year project, “Museum of Marine Life 2119”. The project highlighted the dangers of human impact on the planet through a dystopian narrative: a future in which aquatic creatures have all gone extinct, replaced by robotic sculptures created in tribute by a marine biologist.

The robotic marine life sculptures were constructed using 3D printing, where various segments were produced and assembled together with a motor that enabled some parts to move realistically.

In the same year, Bao also collaborated with DBS at their DBS Asia X workspace to showcase one of his pieces, “In-Motion”:

Taking inspiration from the golden ratio found in nature, the installation represents an artistic showcase of constant innovation, captured by the movement and interactivity of the piece. Similar to “Museum of Marine Life 2119”, this installation was constructed and assembled through 3D printing. Bao created the models through modelling software (such as Tinkercad, Fusion 360, or Rhinoceros 3D), which allowed him to construct objects on his computer before 3D printing them.

Getting into 3D Printing

Bao’s journey as a maker began during his school years through his desire to turn the ideas he had into physical works.

As with anyone getting into 3D printing, it took some time before Bao was able to create items to his satisfaction. He had to overcome challenges on his own when he first started out on his 3D printing journey, such as learning through trial and error to understand the appropriate print settings for the different print designs.

“A lot of times people have the misconception of, ‘Oh, if I design this print, I can just press the print button to get it.’ But it’s not like that. So I took a very long time just to know what settings to use for which design.”

It also helps to inspect your print every now and then to ensure that things are going smoothly.

Bao suggests beginners approach someone with 3D printing knowledge when they are first starting out. “You have to learn quite a bit before you can start to even design a print that is printable on a 3D printer.”

It’s probably why the spaces at MakeIT at Libraries left such a deep impression on him when he first visited them.

Bao thinking up even more ideas to bring to life. Check out his Instagram account for some of his latest creations.

Getting Help at MakeIT at Libraries

MakeIT at Libraries are free-to-use makerspaces located within selected NLB libraries where people can learn about 3D printing, robotics, coding and other crafting tools of the future. To help beginners learn the ropes of being a maker, programmes are also held regularly at the venue, conducted by experienced coaches.

When Bao was just starting out, he had to figure things out on his own through lengthy trial-and-error experiments with the printer settings. Because of this, he now has a healthy appreciation for the guidance that MakeIT at Libraries provides to newcomers. With the various workshops, facilities, and maker coaches at MakeIT, such makerspaces are now better equipped to cater to aspiring creators.

“It’s better to have someone advising you on how you can create your prints. Having other people coaching you on the basics is the most efficient way to go about learning something. After perhaps a few sessions, you will start to understand the thought process that goes behind each setting or print,” says Bao.

While Bao does his own 3D printing at home, MakeIT at Libraries provides an appealing alternative as the venue is also a common space for others with similar interests. It’s where he’s able to interact and exchange ideas.

In this article, we discuss:

Keep reading to develop a solid plan that safeguards your marriage and business.

Benefits of Real Estate Investing as a Married Couple

First, let’s talk about why operating a business that involves real estate investing as a married couple is a good idea:

Shared goals

Peace mind

Reliability

You and your spouse will share financial goals in your business. For instance, there will not be interoffice politics to navigate, and you will both work to secure your financial freedom.

Working with someone you trust, like your spouse, there is also peace of mind. Since you trust your spouse, the business will benefit from your stability and commitment to your marriage and the company.

Before You Start Real Estate Investing as a Married Couple

Before you dive into a real estate business with your spouse, you should discuss:

How (or if) you will incorporate your business?

Who will be the owner of the business?

Who will manage the business?

After you answer these questions with your spouse, make sure to write your decisions down. Having these agreements in writing protects both of you in the event of:

Divorce

Death

Surrender of the business

No one wants to think about the bad things that can happen in a marriage, but those adverse events have ramifications for your business. That’s why it’s essential to have plans “just in case” different types of scenarios occur.

Options for Running Your Real Estate Investing Business as a Married Couple

In general, the IRS allows for four different types of business structures:

Sole proprietorship

Partnerships

Limited Liability Company (LLC)

Corporation

Did you decide that only one spouse will be an owner? You might choose to create a sole proprietorship or a single-member LLC.

Are both you and your spouse going to be owners? You will most likely choose either a partnership, LLC, or a corporation.

Sole proprietorship

The following conditions must be met to be a sole proprietorship:

No other employees are active in the business, including but not limited to children and other relatives

Both spouses must materially participate in running the business

Taxes on a sole proprietorship, each spouse must file:

Schedule C reporting their share of the business’ income

An additional (and separate) self-employment tax form

Employee spouse receives a paycheck with federal income tax and FICA withheld

Considerations for running your business as a sole proprietorship:

Easiest to establish

Generally, one spouse is an “employee,” and the other is the “owner”

You and your spouse are 100% liable if the business fails

No protection from creditors

If you want more detailed information about this business structure, check out our article, “Can My Husband And I Own Our Business Together As A Sole Proprietorship?”

Partnership

Typically a partnership:

Organizes the company so that both you and your spouse share the profits and losses

Formed via a written agreement between two or more parties

Must register in all states where it does business

Both spouses are owners

Taxes on a partnership:

Considerations for running your business as a partnership:

Has opportunities for growth

Multiple types of partnerships (GP, LP, LLP) give your business flexibility

Limited Liability Corporation (LLC)

You will want to check your Secretary of State web page for more details, but in general, to form an LLC:

Taxes on an LLC:

Considerations for running your business as an LLC:

Enables you and your spouse to share money and other resources

Protects you from being sued directly

Shields both you and your spouse’s personal assets from lawsuits

Need management plan for “what if” scenarios

If you want to learn more about how LLCs protect you, your spouse, and your assets, read “What Are The Different LLC Types USe By Real Estate Investors?”

This business structure is a separate entity from either your or your spouse. In general, a corporation:

Each spouse is a shareholder who divides the ownership shares of the company

Individuals have invested money in the business

Incorporation can be complicated

Payout in dividends based on level of investment

Taxes on a corporation:

If you set up as a C Corporation, your corporation files taxes, and you file taxes (double taxation)

If you set an S Corporation, LLC reports income but is sent to you as owners, you have to report the payment, but do not pay self-employment tax

Considerations for running your business as a corporation:

Taxation is more complex

S Corporations have “Pass-through” income which means that you must include your owner’s share of the business income on your income tax return

You may qualify for a qualified joint venture

Final Thoughts

Real estate investing as a married couple can be a massive advantage for both of you. You can secure your financial future together and reduce your tax burden. However, it’s essential to know how to maximize your savings as a real estate investor.

Can I sell my House While in Mortgage Forbearance?,"In March of 2020, the Cares Act was passed to assist homeowners struggling to make mortgage payments file for forbearance during the Covid-19 pandemic. Keep in mind, the Cares Act is only applicable to federal loans which include any Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac products, VA, USDA, and FHA loans. However, many private lenders were also giving their borrowers forbearance options as well. Since May of 2020, there was a recorded 4.7 million or more cases of homeowners taking advantage of this program as a temporary solution to avoid possible foreclosure. The good news is that there are options and programs that have been made available once forbearance ends.

In fact, roughly two-thirds of all participants have left the forbearance program as of March of 2021 according to the New York Federal Reserve. These options include repayment plans, reinstatements, deferrals or partial claims, loan modifications, and the most popular option of selling the home itself to exit the program.

So yes, it is very possible to sell a home while in mortgage forbearance. This was mostly made possible due to the state of the real estate market in 2020. A survey by the Financial Accounts of the United States shows that home equity was at an all-time high throughout 2020 which made the home selling simple as long as the sales price of the home covered the mortgage and any missed payments during the forbearance process.

Now, it is still not 100% clear how federal guidelines will affect those still in forbearance going into the year 2022, it would seem that most programs are granting homeowners extensions if they can prove financial hardships. The real question that arises is how the end of forbearance may play out for those that have limited options to avoid the risks of delinquencies. These policies will not be around forever so it would be in the best interest for all those still in forbearance to really learn all options and plan and time necessary exit strategies accordingly.

Here are some of the commonly asked questions from homeowners still in forbearance.

What is the downside of mortgage forbearance?

One thing that I would like to note is that mortgage forbearance is not the same thing as mortgage forgiveness. The biggest disadvantage most borrowers face is having to pay back any missed payments during their forbearance time frame. As stated earlier, you will have to make arrangements with your loan servicer to go over all available options of repayment towards the end of the forbearance period.

Does forbearance hurt your credit?

Your loan servicer may report that you file for forbearance, but cannot report it as missed payments so there will not be any negative impact on your credit score. Average credits scores have actually increased all across the board for Americans and interestingly enough, these increases are higher amongst those who chose forbearance. Although this may seem like a good thing, the credit system is primarily used as a tool to help lenders determine the credit risk of their applicants. One may say that the credit score may lose influence when determining creditworthiness, at least for some length of time in the financial industry. So lending may become stricter in the near future.

Does forbearance affect getting a new mortgage?

Many homeowners are opting to downsize if possible, relocate to a more affordable area, and do not want to give up the dream of homeownership, or do their best to keep their current home. So the short answer to this question is yes, but it depends on the type of loan you are wanting to apply for as well as meeting all the financial requirements currently in place already for loan approval. Here is the breakdown.

Conventional Loan: You are eligible for a conventional loan as you are able to pay back (reinstate) all missed payments. This can be done by paying back your servicer directly, reinstating the missed payments through refinancing, or selling your home and reinstating it that way. Now, the rules are a little bit different if you have opted for a repayment program, a deferral program, or a loan modification. In that scenario, it is still possible to qualify for a conventional loan to purchase or refinance but you must make 3 consecutive and on-time payments after entering into any of the programs mentioned.

FHA Loan: The main rule that applies to FHA loans is that you can only take out one FHA loan at a time in most cases. So in this scenario, if you are currently on an FHA loan, you can reinstate the loan and do an FHA refinance or reinstate the loan by selling your home before being able to qualify for another FHA loan. In addition to this, you must also show proof through documentation of no 30 day late payments 12 months prior to forbearance. Now if you opted for a repayment plan, a deferral plan, or loan modification while in an FHA loan there are many caveats. Here are 4 things that you need to know.

If you are getting a new home loan, you must make 3 consecutive payments since being on the plan. If you are doing a no cash-out refinance, you must make 6 consecutive payments since being on the plan If you are doing a cash-out refinance, you must make 12 consecutive payments since being on the plan If you are trying to refinance into an FHA streamline program, you must make 6 consecutive payments since being on the program.

VA loan: You are eligible for a VA loan as long as you meet the reinstatement criteria similar to the FHA loans. If you opted for a repayment plan, deferral plan, or loan modification, you must make 3 consecutive payments since the plan before you qualify for a refinance or be approved for another purchase loan. The VA can only be used for your primary residence so you need to speak to your lender regarding conditions of getting a 2 ndVA loan if possible.

Can I sell my house after refinancing?

In most cases, yes, but there are some exceptions. An owner-occupancy clause can require you to live in your house for 6–12 months before you sell it or rent it out. You must contact your servicer to determine if there is an owner-occupancy clause in place and what requirements are needed.

When should I get out of forbearance?

Honestly, this depends on your overall financial health and your comfortability to make payments. The sooner you get out of forbearance, the less you have to make up to reinstate your loan. If you are in a phase in your life where you are still struggling to make ends meet, talk to your lender about ways to reduce payments through loan modifications or deferral programs. And if those options are still unrealistic for you, look into ways of possibly selling your home. Avoid any possibility of delinquencies or foreclosures at all costs. Those are mistakes that will eliminate any options needed to get out of bad situations and just add on more consequences down the line.

Worst case Scenarios: Having limited options while in forbearance

Unfortunately, some homeowners currently in forbearance are faced with the challenge of both not being able to sell their home or continue to make payments even after a loan modification or deferral. These scenarios can stem from factors like getting a divorce while in forbearance or inheriting a property that is in forbearance. Both scenarios are complicated, expensive, and become very time-consuming when time is of the essence. Other challenges include situations like properties being underwater where more is owed than what the property is worth. This can be due to physical distress or outside factors that caused your property to depreciate.

Is a short sale necessary?

Even though short sales are a viable option, it is not always an available solution or the best solution. Short selling is an agreement where the lender will accept a much lower payoff amount in the event the homeowner goes into delinquency or are facing foreclosure. Short sales make a lot of sense to lenders if the cost of foreclosure exceeds the cost of the short sale. This usually happens when a home is in major physical distress and will sell for next to nothing at Auction. There are few real estate professionals out there that understand how to navigate a short sale properly since they are rarely done. Only savvy real estate investors are willing to purchase homes with major physical distress and are willing to deal with the frustration of a lender’s foreclosure department.

Why it may make sense to work with a real estate investor?

A seasoned real estate investor usually has the experience necessary to create a win-win scenario for both homeowners and lenders. In order to save the homeowners from possibly delinquencies, investors are willing to expend capital to buy more time for homeowners that may be going through situations like divorce or probate. They may also reinstate the loan on the homeowner’s behalf as well and take over payments for a brief time even though it means taking on the risk of being foreclosed on instead. This is possible because investors have access to private capital to pay off the mortgage in the event that may happen. And yes, they will only do so in the event that they believe that can generate some sort of profit from the transaction. Sometimes they are even able to help the homeowners get some form of profit as well.

10 Tricks to Squeeze Every Inch out of a Small Closet,"HOW TO GET MORE SPACE OUT OF A SMALL CLOSET

When people think about organization, they often conjure up images of a large walk-in closet or spacious hallways. While it’s nice to have lots of room and a lot of storage options available, that’s not realistic for everyone.

You may be living in a small apartment, paying off student loans, raising young children — any number of things can keep you from having the luxury of an extra-large closet. So, if you’ve ever found yourself wishing you had more closet space, this article is for you.

Because we’ve got some tricks up our sleeves to help you squeeze every inch out of a small closet. And best of all, none of these tricks require taking up more floor space with a giant metal container. You can do most of these tricks from inside your closet!

1. GET A CLOTHING RACK

The first thing you should do is get yourself a sturdy clothing rack. Clothes hangers are an easy and affordable way to get more closet space, and they can be placed in any corner of your room that doesn’t have anything else stored in it.

Clothes hangers can be used to store clothing, while the rack itself can be used to store shoes, hats, and even blankets or pillows. If you have limited closet space, a clothing rack is a great way to increase your storage capacity without taking up additional floor space.

2. ADD STORAGE UNDER CLOTHES

One of the best ways to get more wear out of your clothing is to add storage underneath. This not only provides a place for hanging clothes but also makes it easier to see what you have so you don’t buy anything you don’t need.

It’s also a great way to maximize the space you have without making your closet look cluttered or messy.

3. RE-ORGANIZE SEASONALLY

One of the best ways to avoid being overwhelmed by the clothes in your closet is to take a seasonal approach to organize them. By organizing your closet by season, you can keep each season’s clothing neatly separated from one another while still having easy access to the items you want to wear.

This not only keeps your closet from looking like a total mess, but it also helps you wear what you want without having to dig through piles of clothes you don’t want to wear just to get to the pieces you do want to wear. No more digging through the back of your closet for that perfect pair of jeans or searching for that perfect top to wear with that new pair of jeans you bought!

4. HIDE ITEMS BEHIND GLASS DOORS

One of the best tricks to get more wear out of your closet is to hide items behind glass doors. This not only makes it easier to find what you’re looking for, but it also gives you a sense of order and organization to help you declutter.

You can also use this trick to display items like shoes and purses. This makes it easier to see what you have and helps you pick out new pieces to add to your wardrobe.

5. GET SHELF DIVIDERS

To get more space for your clothes, you need to invest in shelf dividers. They create more shelving space for your clothes by giving you some open shelf space in between them. The trick is to get dividers that you can slide into the tracks and raise or lower as needed.

6. UTILIZE MODULAR SHELVING

Modular shelving is a great way to create extra closet space. Not only is it a great organizational tool, but it’s also a lot cheaper than purchasing a custom hanger system.

It is an ideal solution for small closet space. By using a combination of slotted and flush mount shelves, you can pack a lot of clothing into a small space.

7. PURGE YOUR CLOSET

One of the best ways to free up space in your closet is to get rid of the clothes you don’t wear anymore. The longer you let things collect dust in your closet, the harder it will be to make space for new items.

So go through your closet and purge anything that doesn’t fit, doesn’t match anything else, or isn’t something that expresses yourself through when you wear it.

This will make room for the things you do wear and get much-needed breathing room in your closet so you can fit more clothes in!

8. INSTALL TASK LIGHTING

Even if you have a small closet, there are a few tricks you can use to make the most of the space. First up, install task lighting.

Not only does this give you a better idea of what you have and how to wear it, but it also makes it easier to see your clothes and decide what to keep and what to pass on

9. INSTALL SLIDING DOORS

If you want to maximize the amount of space in your closet, there is one simple way to maximize the amount of stored clothing. Install sliding doors. This will allow you to roll out your clothing or store it away when not in use. The trick to a small closet is to use a sliding door.

Instead of having to squeeze everything in and out, a sliding door allows you to use the space you have more efficiently by moving things out of your way.

10. CALL ON WICKER BASKETS

When we need storage but don’t have a big enough closet, we turn to our wicker baskets. If you don’t have wicker baskets, you can use the baskets from your kitchen, but don’t use the old ones.

A wicker basket will fit perfectly inside the closet, making it easier to store and use the space inside.

With all of these tricks combined, you can have a small closet that is more functional and spacious than you ever thought possible. It’s also going to save you time getting dressed in the morning as well as increase your productivity.",https://medium.com/@HomeImprovementMagazine/10-tricks-to-squeeze-every-inch-out-of-a-small-closet-859431dd7066,['Home Improvement'],2022-01-14 10:03:43.753000+00:00,"['Home Improvement', 'Homedesign', 'Decoration', 'Home Decor', 'Room Decor']"
There is a HappyLand Property that is made for you!,"After releasing the HappyLand map, we received tons of questions about our land areas and the halcyon economy of the game. Hence, we need to trumpet some official information about our land.

In real life, one of the most popular ways for people to invest is real estate. And nowadays, there are more and more records being witnessed in the sales of virtual lands as some plots of virtual land are being sold at staggering prices. Virtual land is an example of an NFT, designed to be accessible through the blockchain. Virtual land ownership is becoming voguish because it opens a fresh way for people to access and purchase land. Decentralized crypto networks lower the level of trust required for collaboration. As a result, they are most beneficial anywhere the requirement for confidence is a bottleneck to scaling.

Additionally, scarcity in the virtual land market drives up the value of these digital assets a lot. Only a limited amount of lands are being sold as a part of a game or a metaverse, and it determines who will be a resident of that metaverse. In conclusion, land ownership with NFT accelerate users’ right and help them self-custody the digital assets and claim stake into something they are interested in.

Same as in the world of HappyLand, we encourage players to consider lands as valuable assets or long-term investments for themselves. A fascinating experience for us is to observe what the players do with HappyLand world, what kinds of organizations will emerge, which lands become desirable, and how people will construct and evolve them. The game lands are priceless for their scarcity and have unlimited use cases. As more people join the game, the land becomes scarcer than ever. The early birds who have access to the very first land plots will have an opportunity to trade their property, become a landlord by collecting vast amounts of land and be the only person to own that token on the blockchain. The developers of HappyLand have no ownership in lands once lands have been sold to players.

Types of Land

Owning NFT land is the first step and a prerequisite to participating in the world of HappyLand. There are five different types of land: Highland, Valley, Woodland, Meadow, and Euphoria-land. We divided the land into many areas because each land type is designed and optimized based on the financial roadmap of each specific group of players.

Any land in HappyLand is a mystery waiting for players to discover. No two plots will be the same, and no one can duplicate the land you bought.

Each plot you own will act as your empire, where you can freely build according to your rich imagination. However, there will only be a certain number of items you can craft, so you should consider an appropriate mix of investments. If your financial ability allows, try to step out of your comfort zone and own more than one plot of land. The closer the land is to the central area, the larger the farming space. A default house and a default warehouse will automatically come with the piece of land you bought, which means you are purchasing a plot of land and a foundation for your new life in HappyLand with two beautiful houses that the game gives you.

What we are always proud of when building HappyLand is the ambition of the developer team. We aspire to create a world as close to reality as possible. Those are the lands in HappyLand with different ranks, subdivisions, and characteristics.

To have a closer and more penetrating view, we will specifically analyze each component of this vast world.

Highland is a mountainous area full of obstacles and difficulty of access. Here, it will be arduous for players to cultivate and achieve excellent yields. You will need to consider diversifying your land fund when owning land in this region.

Owning land in Euphoria is a pride for anyone, but only genius minds can exploit the total value.

Crops Rarity

Built with the mission to simulate the world of farming most realistically, HappyLand wishes to bring the most realistic experiences to the game’s landowners. Each type of land will have different exploitation potentials, the more valuable the land, the more diverse the crops on the land. Crops are among the first in-game items that players need to own to build their farm economy model. With crops, players can experience the daily work of a real farmer when taking care of his garden with the aim of harvesting as many agricultural products as possible.

There will also be a maximum number of beds that can be placed on your plot of land depending on your land type .

The crop rarity level is as follows (1 being the least profitable, 5 being the most):

Common crops Rare crops Epic crops Legendary crops Mythical crops

How Does Hydrogen Peroxide Benefit Your Smile?,"Your smile says a lot about you, and it is important to have a smile that you can proudly share with others. Additionally, your oral health is important for maintaining excellent overall health. Having excellent oral hygiene slows the spread of bacteria, protects against infection and reduces your chances of developing serious illnesses.

Restylane Therapy is a clear, biodegradable gel made mostly from Hyaluronic Acid.

Hyaluronic Acid is located normally in your body: but also, for Restylane Treatment production, it is made by a procedure which entails the fermentation of the Bacterium Streptococci. Hyaluronic Acid is the energetic component.

The significant professional product called Restylane is just one of the newer skin injectable therapies in the Anti-Aging market.

Your Qualified Professional will normally provide your Treatment over 10 mins to 1 hr, depending on how large the location to be dealt with is.

Before giving Restylane and Belotero Lips Shape Lidocaine shots, your Specialist may use a regional anesthetic to numb the treatment area. A percentage of Restylane gel is after that infused right into the skin with a slim needle. (Because the needle is thin, minimal discomfort should be associated with the shots). The Hyaluronic Acid particles in the Restylane gel normally pull in water, causing the cells to underline and wrinkles to plump up. This immediately submits creases and provides the skin with a smoother surface area. And also the result is a younger-looking face in mins!

When the gel has been finished, people are cost-free to return to typical activities. The Hyaluronic Acid gel, as soon as infused right into the area or locations to be treated, is progressively broken down. So, the length of time does each therapy last? Well, after numerous months (perhaps even as high as twelve-month), the effects of the Hyaluronic Acid will certainly discolour, with no trace of the filler being left.

Hair loss, which affects both men and women, can harm one’s self-esteem and emotional health. This assertion is backed up by the fact that the hair restoration industry in America has reportedly crossed the 3.5 billion dollar level.

Hair transplants are expensive procedures that can cost anything from $3000 to $15000. As a result, many patients travel to neighboring countries where the procedures are less expensive. For example, a hair transplant procedure might cost as little as $1500 in South Africa and Turkey.

Turkey has become a mecca for hair transplants, with a slew of highly regarded hair transplant surgeons. However, be cautious because there are a lot of gamblers out there, and some services aren’t compliant.

Based on our research, we suggest you look into some clinics like Blue Magic Group, Smile Hair Clinic & Hair of Istanbul. However, look for more clinics offering the best hair transplant in Turkey and compare them to your requirements.

How to Get a Glimpse of Turkey’s Hair Transplant Industry?

Every year, thousands of men and women pack their bags and travel to Turkey in the hopes of regaining their hair. The hair transplant industry in Turkey, based in Istanbul, is valued over $1 billion. As the industry is booming, it becomes all the more important that you do research before ending up in Turkey for a hair transplant. Here are some things you can do to get a better understanding of the hair transplant industry.

Although Turkey has struggled with economic and political turmoil in recent years, with the Turkish Lira losing a lot of value, patients from the United Kingdom, Europe, and the Middle East go to the country for hair transplants. The cost of hair transplant in Turkey is inexpensive, as is the cost of flights.

Most patients travel from the UK , USA, Ireland and Italy to Turkey for a hair transplant. It is because the cost of hair transplant in Turkey is 3–4 times lower compared to these countries. In Turkey, you will find clinics that charge more and some that charge less. However, keep in mind that clinics which are expensive have the latest technologies, experienced surgeons and proven record of results, they are sure to provide you the best results. The same cannot be said for clinics that charge less, as they might lack the proper technology and expertise to perform this complicated procedure. To counter the issue of high cost, some clinics in Turkey like Blue Magic provide flex payment solutions. This allows patients to avail flexible payment options if they don’t want to make the complete payment at once.

Turkey’s hair transplant market is fiercely competitive. Most clinics charge between $1500-$4000 to attract medical tourists. Because of these low numbers, unqualified and inexperienced specialists can fill the gap by offering a “solution” — do your research on the competitors thoroughly.

Some interesting statistics:

In Turkey, almost 500 doctors are competent hair surgeons.

There are about 350 hair transplant clinics in Istanbul alone.

The industry is believed to be worth more than a billion dollars.

Each year, over 60,000 medical tourists travel to Turkey for hair transplants.

This point cannot be overstated. If you’re planning on going for a hair transplant clinic in Turkey, make sure an internationally recognized body accredits the clinic like the JCI. Also, ensure they have an updated local licensing.

Clinics with a good reputation will never employ persuasive language or pay for customer referrals to promote their services. It’s difficult to pick a winner in a competitive market, so don’t be fooled by recommendation hunters. Your best bet is to get proof of clinical outcomes and speak with the clinic directly.

If you are new to the hair transplant industry, we recommend that you first use the Norwood Scale to determine your hair loss stage and then look up similar patients on hair loss forums to see how they fared. You can also request samples of similar Norwood scale case studies and patient testimonials from the clinic.

Collect reviews and research patients that have undergone a hair transplant from the particular clinic through google reviews, quora, reddit, facebook and hair transplant forums in social media. You can ask the previous HT patients about the results and overall quality of the treatment.

Before committing to a hair transplant surgery, double-check that the surgeon performs it. Sometimes surgeons delegate tasks to junior personnel or helpers with little or no training in the subject.

Don’t be deceived by a catchy headline. Because your hair is likely to be your crowning pride, verify that the surgeon is Board Certified and accredited to conduct this procedure in his country.

The International Society of Hair Restoration Doctors (ISHRS) carefully examines surgeons, and its elite membership reflects the field’s top experts. From Turkey, only a few surgeons are listed as ISHRS experts (International Society of Hair Restoration Surgeons).

Photographic evidence of hair restorations, such as before-and-after photos, is essential for evaluating a surgeon’s style and skill. They should be willing to exhibit instances of their work at different phases, such as before surgery, after surgery, a few months afterward, and two to three years later. Patients who are willing to provide testimonies would also be valuable. Clinics that use stock photos should be avoided. Make sure you run a Google search for any photos that have been used twice.

Prepare questions for your first appointment by conducting your research and checking for real patient testimonies. Research the clinic thoroughly and speak with the surgeon via video call. Trust your instincts, and if any of the responses make you nervous, double-check your options. Remember, going for a hair transplant particularly in a foreign country is a big decision to make. So, ensure that you collect all relevant information and are ready before traveling to Turkey.

Myopractics is a whole body working treatment focused on helping people get out of pain by restoring balance, and motion to the body. Each treatment includes a complete body evaluation and soft tissue manipulation where the myopractor works.

Myth or Doubt Regarding Myo Practice Therapy

If you avoid myopractic therapy and focus on other solutions for shoulder pain in Mesa due to any doubt or myth about therapy in mind, then it must be cleared that Myopractic massage doesn’t involve any bone manipulation or bone-crunching technique.

But, it works on tight muscles that might be pulling bones out of place. My practice therapy is intended to provide a pain-free treatment, ensuring long-term effects. Once you get the natural motion of the body resolving the main issue, you won’t need any other following-up sessions, unlike other manual therapies.

The clients are asked to inform the therapist of any discomfort during a therapy session to adjust the pressure or technique to meet the client’s comfort level.

Is Myopractic therapy Safe?

MyoPractic massage therapy is undeniably safe for everyone suffering from musculoskeletal pain, provided that a well-trained myopractor performs it. It doesn’t have any side effects as it does not encompass any bone manipulation.

A myopractor mainly implements stretching techniques and suggests that their clients get rid of this pain with corrective exercises.

Let’s take a quick look at significant differences between Myopractic and Chiropractic therapy to clear any further doubts regarding the working of both.

MyoPractic Vs. Chiropractic Therapy

The MyoPractic therapy focuses on muscle health, while chiropractic primarily emphasizes on spine and its control on the entire nervous system. This therapy also works for other joints throughout the body. Are you wondering whether there is any Myopractic near me to get me out of this consistent shoulder pain? Is there any affordable and quick solution to shoulder Mesa? Come to Get Natural Motion, and say goodbye to this annoying pain forever!

Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that affects the entire body’s ability to clot either due to lack, or extremely reduced level of certain protein, known as the clotting factors. There are thirteen types of clotting factors which work with platelets to stop bleeding towards the injury side.

This means that after injury, the person bleeds for a longer time than they would if their blood clotted normally. Hemophilia can also result in internal bleeding in specific area like; knees, ankles, and elbows which can damage organs and tissues. This can further lead to life-threatening complications

This internal bleeding can be seriously devastating, if it occurs within the brain, as it results in causing;

Headaches

Seizures

Decreased level of consciousness

Hemophilia is more prevalent in males. According to the World Federation of Hemophilia, about one in 10,000 people are born with this condition. There are two main types of Hemophilia;

Hemophilia A

Hemophilia A is the most common type, and usually occurs as a result of deficiency in clotting factor VIII

Hemophilia B

Also known as the Christmas disease, Hemophilia B occurs as a deficiency in clotting factor IX.

Other types are hemophilia which results from a deficiency in clotting factor XI, and para hemophilia that is due to deficiency in clotting factor V. In rare cases it happens that Hemophilia can develop after birth, this is known as Acquired Hemophilia

Hemophilia is associated with;

Autoimmune D

Pregnancy

Cancer

The Root Causes of Hemophilia

Hemophilia is a congenital disorder caused by a defect in a gene located on the X chromosome that determines how the body makes clotting factor 8, 9, or 11. Everyone inherits two sex chromosomes, one from each parent.

Female inherit two x chromosomes, one from each parent, and males have an x chromosome from the mother and y chromosome from the father, the genetic defect that causes hemophilia is located on the x chromosome. It is passed down from mother to the son through the mother’s gene.

This is to say, a male that gets an X chromosome with an altered gene from his mother will have the disorder. Males, unlike the females, lack a second x chromosomes, and so are unable to make up for the defective gene.

A female that has an altered gene on one of her x chromosomes is a carrier, she doesn’t have the disease herself, but she may pass it on to her children. For a female to have this disorder, she must have an altered gene on both of her x chromosomes. However, this is very rare.

How to Recognize Hemophilia? The Notable Symptoms

The level of clotting determines severity of symptoms, including;

Getting too many large bruises

Blood in urine / stool

Unusual bleeding after vaccinations

Excessive & unexplained bleeding from any cut or injury, after surgery, dental work

Unusual nose bleed without any cause, pain, or swelling around the joint

Whereas, the symptoms of brain bleeding may include;

Lethargy

Headaches

Double vision

Seizures

Paralysis

Sudden weakness or clumsiness

How to diagnose, and is there any best treatment?

The medical history and blood tests are key to diagnose on suspicion. The physician will ask about family history, and medical history to help with identifying the cause. Thus, a blood test may give information about the level of clotting factors.

Which clotting factor is missing, and the time it’ll take for blood to clot pregnant women who’re carriers, they may have their fetus tested for the condition.

As far as recommendable treatment for Hemophilia is concerned, so replacement therapy is the only best solution for it. It focuses on receiving replacement of specific clotting factor that is missing, is given intravenously.

However, the treatment can be derived from human blood or synthetically produced in a lab. The synthetically produced factors are known as recombinant clotting factor, and is considered as treatment for choice as they reduce the risk of transmitting carried infection towards other human beings.

The recommendable treatments for Hemophilia include;

Anti-fibrinolytic

Fibrin sealants

Physical therapy

Yes, but first we need to learn what an infusion therapy is. Well, it’s a convenient way for doctors to give a medication to any patient who’s unable to take by mouth.

In case of urgent home medical service, a patient is given an IV catheter which directly goes into their vein. The nurse guides patient’s caretaker how to give these ID medications.

According to recent research, the current, and highly demanding treatment for Hemophilia A these days is, factor replacement therapy which is done by infusing a VIII product into veins of victim patient. Life Care Infusion is a specialty pharmacy based in South Nevada, and deals in supplying best treatment for Hemophilia with infusion therapy. It also serve as strong supporter of the National Hemophilia Foundation- Nevada Chapter.",https://medium.com/@playafamilydentistry01/how-does-hydrogen-peroxide-benefit-your-smile-7e71fa18e33f,['Playa Family Dentistry'],2022-01-04 07:29:59.183000+00:00,"['Dentistry', 'Dentist Near You', 'Dentist In Usa', 'Dentist', 'Dentist Tampa']"
"Crypto, NFTs, and the Metaverse — Should you care?","From building flying cars to cultivating life on Mars, we clearly love imagining a future that is simpler, better, more interesting, and something way beyond our limited understanding of the world.

It’s something that gives us hope, it’s something that reminds us of how advanced we really are and what we’re truly capable of as a society full of high (more low than high) functioning apes.

For instance, in 1958, ‘America’s Independent Electric Light and Power Companies’ launched an advertisement that showed two women and a dog (presumably a beagle) just casually flying around in a UFO-like vehicle.

The advertisement stated, “tomorrow’s higher standard of living will put electricity to work for you in ways still unheard of!”.

AIELPC further pitched to the readers that electricity is the way forward, that you would require a “lot more” of it, and promised that they would lead the world in that direction.

And, are we there yet?

Well, today, we have Tesla and other leading automobile behemoths along with the power & energy sectors making all of that a reality.

But what happened to the flying car dream?

Well, we’re not there yet. Honestly, I’m not sure if we ever will.

Can I imagine a world full of electric vehicles? Yes.

But do I envision a world where there will be cars flying around along with airplanes, helicopters, and spaceships? A big fat NO.

One could make the argument that the AIELPC used something like a ‘flying car’ to sell the idea of a better tomorrow or perhaps just to ensure stakeholders that they are in it for the long run.",https://medium.com/@_sanjitmisra/crypto-nfts-and-the-metaverse-should-you-give-a-crap-132feab79e9,['Sanjit Misra'],2022-01-01 06:36:32.414000+00:00,"['Technology', 'Metaverse', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Blockchain', 'Nft']"

The sale of MetaGrail NFT on Binance NFT market has been successfully concluded, and the 100D Airdrop Plan will start tomorrow!

Introduction

The value discovery of GameFi is done through the “Play to Earn” model, where players from all over the world can create and capture value by playing the game. The value of SocialFi has been hidden in social interaction over and over again, and we need to demonstrate the value of SocialFi to the entire market through social behavior value.

SocialFi hopes to help more people with different levels of social influence reap the benefits of their social influence by toeing their social influence into a self-consistent economy.

Therefore, SocialFi’s ability to capture value depends on its granularity — what SocialFi demonstrates is the social value of an individual, and the value ecosystem of SocialFi can only grow and expand by empowering individuals with the value and social impact of the content they produce. MetaGrail works tirelessly towards this goal.

The following are the major events that MetaGrail has carried out, welcome your attention:

Online Binance NFT exchange market

MetaGrail NFT has successfully launched a public offering on Binance NFT exchange market. The launch received a lot of support from the community. And it also occupied the first position of Binance’s best-selling works soon.

100D Airdrop Plan - Cheers In Metaverse

Most platform models require an efficient curation mechanism to improve the matching efficiency of supply and demand and avoid falling into the dilemma of ineffective social networks driving out value social networks. The essence of social interaction lies in the exchange of value. While emphasizing decentralized finance, SocialFi also aims to reduce the cost of social interaction, increase the value of social interaction, and reject inefficient or even ineffective social interaction.

MetaGrail’s hosting of this event is the first step towards realizing the Social value of the Metaverse, creating “Social To Earn”. Users can earn a total of 115.3 million Grail tokens per day by simply participating in market buzz interactions.

About MetaGrail

MetaGrail is a decentralized social protocol that studies the standards for generating meta-social networks. Our vision is achieved by developing an open social protocol standard based on blockchain technology, building an integrated and interoperable social protocol matrix, and forming a standardized and universal social protocol to serve decentralized social networks.

On one hand, MetaGrail creates the ownership economy of NFT by attaching identity recognition and social trajectory to NFTs, and through a unique social token issuance model. On the other hand, MetaGrail’s mission is to improve the decentralized social ecosystem by taking sociability as a breakthrough point. It not only encourages the co-creation and sharing of social content, but also subverts the traditional social-economic model, monetizes social influence, and provides a wide range of applications and prospects for the SocialFi field.

The MetaGrail team embraces and encourages the concept of win-win, widely accepts mainstream DApps (Decentralized application) in the market to incorporate into its social protocol, provides consensus-based decentralized social protocol infrastructure, and works with all parties to build a shared social ecosystem that is more suitable for decentralization, and accelerates the value migration process. Using the non-tamperable, transparent, and traceable characteristics of the blockchain, a more complete and self-consistent free economic model and social metaverse are established.

TKNZ.gg — The Museum of Gaming and Esports History,"Imagine the world in 5 years.

The metaverses are embraced.

Concerts are online.

Currencies are digital.

Metaverse presence is more important than physical presence.

Art is presented in virtual worlds and kept in NFT museums.

Gaming is (still) the most popular entertainment and pastime choice of people.

It is everywhere, in every aspect of life.

Esports are by far the most popular and participated competitive events in the world.

Every business and every brand are relying on gamers and esports fans as some of their most important customers.

Which are the biggest events of the year? The Super Bowl? The Champions League final?

Nah. It’s the esports finals, watched live by hundreds of millions.

Where are the memories from the most important moments in gaming and esports history?

In TKNZ.gg, the NFT Museum of the Future.

We see this future as clear as day. And have started laying the foundations for it together with many other fantastic, world-building projects that will be the ecosystem of tomorrow. Here’s what we are doing!

NFT Museum of the Future

NFT (Non-fungible tokens) technology has opened up a myriad of possibilities for creators and consumers to interact.

Some people still view NFTs as nothing more than JPEG images with a price tag. They couldn’t be more wrong. It’s like saying a computer is nothing more than a box with buttons.

NFTs are receipts of ownership. And as such they can enable many different applications.

Yes, at the most fundamental level they indicate ownership of an underlying asset (or assets since one NFT can represent multiple things).

But that is not nearly all.

They can authenticate their owner’s access to exclusive content, spaces, interactions, capabilities, events, etc. Like a ticket.

They can unlock “bonus” features on other platforms and channels. Like a code.

They can signify a proof of achievement or participation. Like a trophy.

They can provide “perks” to their owner within the NFT’s ecosystem. Like a membership.

And this is not all an NFT can do. Not even close.

We are building TKNZ.gg to enable gamers and esports fans to take advantage of the many possibilities this technology creates.

We want the esports organizations and creators of the world to use them to forge deeper and lasting connections with their community.

This is not merchandise. This is content. This is skill. This is art. This is the essence of what makes esports great.

And great things must be preserved and put on display. In The Museum of Gaming and Esports History. TKNZ.gg

Doing things the right way

There can be a fine line between good business and bad business. We don’t want to get even close to it.

You and us, together, are building our future in this world. A world that we’ll live in and our children will live in. We do not want to endanger it. On the contrary, want to make it more beautiful, more diverse, and more sustainable.

It is true that some blockchains have a negative impact on our environment. But not all blockchains are made equal.

The TKNZ.gg blockchain (Flow) is a new generation blockchain that is (almost) infinitely more energy efficient than some of the traditional blockchains, like Bitcoin. And we’re constantly working on improving our technology solutions stack to make this even better.

We care about many things. Not just the sustainability of our environment but also the sustainability of the TKNZ.gg ecosystem.

The entire TKNZ team is comprised of gamers who have, at times, spent their last money on that newly released game title, or to support their favorite creator. And we still do it.

TKNZ.gg is a platform that welcomes everyone, regardless of their background, status or means.

Of course, we will not accept any misbehavior, criminal activity or endangerment of our community.

We consider ourselves The Guardians of The Museum. It is our duty to protect it, its exhibits and its members.

The best content usually comes from creators being their true selves. You know what we mean, we all know authenticity when we see it.

We work hard to ensure the TKNZ NFTs not only preserve that authenticity but they enhance the bond between fan and creator, across many levels and platforms. Digital collectibles can have that superpower, if done right.

Our aim is to bring the best of the gaming and esports world to the fans while supporting the creators and their craft. The TKNZ business model is to share revenues with our partners (the esports organizations and creators) so they can continue doing what makes them great, and we strive to find ways to make you a part of that journey.

A new era of digital collectibles and memorabilia

What is being a fan really?

Is it following your favorite player, team or creator?

Is it reading and watching everything about them?

Is it knowing all the stats and trivia?

Is it supporting them however you can?

Is it enjoying their content in all its forms?

Yes. And more.

Being a fan means having that special connection that makes you want to experience more, to see your favorites succeed and share the highs and lows alongside them.

It’s also about surrounding yourself with little tokens and reminders of your passion. To us, fans, there is a great sense of fulfillment that comes from expanding our fandom.

Some people keep old event tickets. Some have a folder with screenshots from favorite streams and chats. Almost every fan has a t-shirt or a hoodie of their fandom. These are all examples of everyday objects with sentimental value that is difficult to explain. We all fill our lives with such memorabilia in one way or another.

Gaming and esports evoke so much emotion and sentimental value that it is hard to believe we haven’t seen true digital collectibles yet. That’s mostly because physical collectibles do not work very well for fans who enjoy digital content in a digital environment, communicate and engage with their communities online and have digital personas.

Luckily, NFTs seem tailor-made for this, and work incredibly well as digital collectibles.

They are digitally native.

They indicate scarcity with known, pre-set limited edition sizes.

They form sets and collections that can be completed.

They are all recorded and tracked on the blockchain, alongside every transaction and change of ownership.

Their owners can choose to show their real or online identity

NFTs are easily shared and bragged about on social media, chats, etc.

They are protected from “wear and tear” as long as the blockchain exists. (And they can theoretically exist forever.)

They can be enjoyed offline.

And they are not done evolving. NFT technology and applications continue being developed every day by countless brilliant teams around the world.

At TKNZ.gg we call our NFT collectibles “cards”. They come in three tiers: Rare, Epic and Legendary.

Just like trading cards in real life, you can get TKNZ cards in packs.

Then you can build your collections.

Share them with friends and peers.

Trade them with others.

Or show them off in RL.

We are planning to make our NFTs usable in many ways, formats and contexts, including within the most popular content platforms, as well as in virtual worlds and metaverses.

We will communicate more details about our features roadmap in the coming weeks.

The future is full of possibilities.

Come and join us on our mission to build The Museum of Gaming and Esports History!

Odomos , all-out se yada machchhar to mere ballon me fans ke mar rahe the hamare ghar me. Poora nation jab dengue ki chapet me tha, my family was safe, due to my hair.

kabhi koi mehmaan aa jae ghar pe achanak to me mask ke pehle hairnet dhundti thi.Abhi sirf hairnet me jana to achha ni lagta to mask bhi lagana padta tha.

Having bad hair genes truly sucks. I first noticed signs of hair loss at the age of 17 (nothing too extreme). Fast forward ten years and my hairline has only receded more. The truth is that I wouldn’t be so afraid of the idea of becoming bald if I wasn’t so insecure about the size and shape of my head… but I am.

The pandemic only excacerbated the problem; being locked up at home unable to go out and socialize stressed me enough to fall into a deep depression and accelerate my hair loss.

Whether it was the androgenetic alopecia that runs in my family acting on my scalp, telogen effluvium (stress induced hair fall), or a mix of both, this new situation had me panicking like never before. So, like most Web surferers, I started to look for solutions online.

Three products were repeatedly recommended in every forum and blog site I visited; they seemed promising. Their function was not only to stop hair from falling, but to promote new hair to grow as well. Without thinking to much of it, I ordered all three online.

I stayed on this new treatment since early January, 2021, and while it did stop my hair from falling and caused a few strands of it to grow too, I began to experience side effects 10 months later.

Some of the symptoms I experienced were:

Numb face

Aggravated tinnitus

Extreme insomnia

Increased anxiety

Muscle dystrophy

Frequent urination

Mild decrease in libido

Heart palpitations

The worst symptom by far was insomnia.

My sleep quality saw a steady decline since the beginning of October, 2021. I tried ear plugs. Nothing. Then, I went on antihistamines. No improvements either. It was after removing one thing in my life at a time that I found the source of the problem, but by the time this happened, my sleep problems had turned dreadful.

This is my journey to recovery…

1. Managing my expectations

What I first did was ask myself the following questions: do I usually experience side effects from other types of medications, such as antivirals or antibiotics? How do my parents usually respond to medications? How long did it it take for me to experience side effects from this hair loss treatment?

Hm, I sometimes do experience side effects from certain types of drugs and my father always responds negatively to all types of treatments while my mom doesn’t. It also took me more than 9 months to experience any side effects. This led me to believe that I had a 50/50 chance of recovering slowly.

Someone on Reddit suggested that I looked into a website called PropeciaHelp.com. On that website, I was able to find countless other stories from sufferers of this condition and what their road to recovery was like. This helped me understand what to expect and to consider that this may take a very long time; patience was key.

This first part of the journey was important because the severity of many of the symptoms I experienced made me depressed and borderline suicidal; I had to face the reality of the problem in order to adequately change my mindset. I soon after stopped panicking and learned to accept the situation for the time being.

2. Learning to Quit

I’ve suffered from obesity before and, like many know, quitting junk food is hard; the desire I had to enjoy a tasty large burger often outweighted my desire to lose weight. I compared this situation to the desire I had of retaining my hair and having added confidence versus the desire to live a healthy life.

My experience with food, as well as other addictions I’ve suffered from in the past, reminded me of and helped me to take into account one very important thing: rebound.

When I began to experienc side effects, I noticed a sudden increase in hair loss yet again (probably due to stress). Once the side effects diminished, I once again considered retaking the pills, forgetting all about the bad things they had done to my body. The only way I could stop myself from commencing a vicious cycle was to throw the pills away and change my perspective on hair loss. So I did.

Now, I remind myself every day that hair loss is not a condition; it is the natural result of the procreation between two different kinds of ancestors of mine. It’s normal… Although, I would look better with a full set of hair… Damn it, this is hard! Might as well look into a hair transplant.

3. Understanding the Problem

I thought it was important for me to understand the mechanism of these miracle drugs in order to incorporate the right solution for me (something I should’ve probably done before I chugged these pills down my throat for the very first time). Thankfully, I live with a doctor and through her advice together with the information I found online, I was able to make a plan.

One thing I learned was that I should stay away from anything that messes with my hormones; these are involved in an infinite number of processes in our bodies and it is difficult for even the best scientists to keep track of all the undesired outcomes that result from their alteration.

I also learned about the drugs’ half-lives and their effect on our body’s natural detoxification mechanism. It seemed that it would take me at least one month for these drugs to leave my body and for my body to begin recovering. Regardless, I wondered, could there be a way to accelerate the process?

4. Lifestyle Changes and Supplements

I wanted positive results fast (I’m a very impatient guy), so I looked into supplements and lifestyle changes that would help me mitigate some of the side effects I was experiencing.

Insomnia. I set a rigurous sleeping schedule with which I stuck to religiously; I went to bed at 9 pm, sometimes 10 pm, every night because I knew that it would take me anywhere from 6 to 7 hours to fall asleep. Both the time it took me to fall asleep and the time I stayed asleep were persistent issues.

I also started taking melatonin (yes, it’s a hormone, but it was only for a few days), but only when I began to sleep between 3 and 4 hours a day. I also never took it daily and I quit using it after one week because, according to this article,

“If you take melatonin orally, you’re essentially taking away the need for your body making melatonin on its own. This then throws off your natural production of melatonin and might lead to consequences when you forget to take the supplement.”.

I also discovered that this hair loss treatment probably messed with all sorts of neurotransmitters and neurosteroids in my body; basically, it most likely ruined things in my brain and my nervous system.

What I found on the internet is that there’s an important neurosteroid in our brains called allopregnanolone, which helps our bodies to relax. It is synthesized from progesterone by the sequential actions of two enzymes, one of which is called 5α-reductase type I (5α-RI. ). This enzyme’s production is actually inhibited by the drug I was taking.

Why is this important? Well, allopregnanolone acts as a potent neuromodulator for the actions of an amino acid called GABA at GABA(A) receptors, say scientists. In other words, it activates these receptors, and according to an article I read online, GABA(A) receptors are directly involved in our body’s natural sleep process.

I also read that GABA is as much a receptor agonist for GABA(A) as allopregnanolone is (an activator). Thus, my non-scientific logic told me that I needed more GABA while my brain naturally fixed its allopregnanolone production problems. I also came across another article that explained the effectiveness of combining GABA and L-Theanine to decrease sleep latency and improve NREM sleep. Well, this certainly worked for me!

Nevertheless, taking into account that I am not a neuroscientist or a doctor, I decided to quit using these supplements once I felt my body had recovered enough to go on its own.

Finally, I continued to use foam ear plugs and a sleep mask throughout my whole journey to avoid any noise and light source during the night.

Increased Urination and Possible Shrunken Prostate. The need to go pee would wake me up several times a night. I set myself the rule to not drink any liquids after 7 pm.

My increased urination problems resolved on their own and I have no idea what size my prostate is, but I hope it’s regular-sized.

Muscle Dystrophy. I am almost completely positive that this problem was a direct result of the sleeping issues I was having. This is because once I started to rest properly, my muscles stopped shrinking.

I used creatine to lift heavier weights and retain some water to increase the size of my muscles. I avoided taking it at night though, because it gave me a lot of energy. I also continued to consume around ~120 grams of protein every day and I never stopped going to the gym. I had to be careful with the latter however, since having no sleep meant my body wasn’t recovering enough.

Abolished Gut Bacteria. Like many antibiotics, this treatment seemed to have wiped out my gut bacteria, causing me to have bad stool, strange flatulance, and obnoxious stomach aches. This affected my sleep too, since the pain or distraction wouldn’t let me sleep. I restored it by consuming basic lactobacilli every day.

Next time I’ll make sure to spend more money on this to further increase the biodiversity of my stomach’s bacteria, since greater diversity leads to a healthier microbiome (as all things in nature).

Low Libido and ED. I never looked too much into these since these symptoms weren’t as pronounced as the rest. Nevertheless, when I did see weak erections, I tried to improve them by first fixing my sleep and by trying a supplement I found in an online homeopathic store.

What I did notice is that as soon as I started sleeping properly again, my erections went up to 110%.

Low DHT. As I had mentioned previously, 5α-reductase type I (5α-RI. ) is an enzyme inhibited by the hair loss treatment I was taking. This enzyme metabolizes testosterone into something called dihydrotestosterone (or DHT), according to many studies. In addition to that, low DHT can cause breast development in men and weight increase, between other things, says one other study.

When I started taking the drugs responsible for this catastrophe, I was also attempting to counter the effects of creatine, which I’ve always taken to build muscle. Some studies link creatine to an increase in DHT inside our bodies and other studies link DHT to hair loss due to its miniaturization effects on hair follicles, especially those with androgenetic alopecia.

Ironically, once I started experiencing all the side effects of my treatment, I used creatine with the intent to save my body from that same treatment; I took creatine every day to hopefully restore my DHT levels.

Vitamins and Minerals. A few studies have found vitamin d deficiency in patients who took the same pills I did. I therefore started spending more time under the sun (with sunscreen, of course) and took vitamin d supplements. Some other supplements I took were magnesium and omega-3.

Caffeine. I was never a big fan of coffee, but apparently caffeine has therapeutic effects against neurological diseases through neurotrasmitter modulation. Now I’m a huge coffee fan!

5. My Results

I made a slow but steadily recovery. I went from sleeping 1 hour every 2 or 3 days during the first week after suspending my medication, to 2 hours every other day the following week, then 3 hours every day, and so on so forth. Now, I am able to sleep 7 to 8 hours a day without waking up in middle of the night.

Furthermore, the sensitivity on my face’s skin returned, my heart palpitations stopped, my anxiety decreased, and I noticed an overall improvement in my wellbeing. Also, my muscles and joints finally stopped aching and I felt that I was truly getting the rest my body needed after so long.

I will never forget this experience as it was one of the worst ordeals I had ever had to deal with in my life. I’m happy to have gotten out of it.

How To Replace Bad Eating Habits With Good Ones,"Identify your bad eating habits and find out what causes them. And then gradually replace them with good ones.

1. Start a food diary

It will help you figure out what eating habits you have now. Keep records for a week.

Write down exactly what you ate, how much and at what time.

Make notes about your well-being: “hungry”, “stressed”, “bored”, “tired”. This will explain why you ate something. For example, you got bored at work, and you bought a chocolate bar.

At the end of the week, review the records and identify your eating habits. Decide which ones you want to change.

Don’t set yourself many goals at once, move gradually. To begin with, limit yourself to two or three goals. For example, such as:

drink skimmed milk instead of whole milk;

drink more water during the day;

instead of sweets, there are fruits for dessert;

take healthy snacks and homemade food with you for lunch;

learn to distinguish when you eat because you are hungry, and when — from stress or boredom.

2. Identify triggers

Think about what caused these habits. Maybe something in your environment provokes you to eat when you are not hungry. Or the choice of food is influenced by emotions. Review the food diary entries and circle the recurring triggers. For example:

you saw something delicious in the kitchen or in the vending machine;

do you eat while watching TV shows;

are you stressed at work or in another field;

you are tired after a working day, but you have nothing ready for dinner;

you have to eat junk food at work;

do you eat fast food for breakfast;

by the end of the day, you want to please yourself with something.

Focus on one or two triggers that are triggered most often. Think about how to avoid them.

Do not pass by the vending machine on your way to work.

Prepare dinner in advance or prepare groceries to get through the evening quickly.

Do not keep harmful snacks at home. If someone from the household buys them, keep them so that they do not catch your eye.

Suggest buying fruits instead of sweets for workshops. Or bring them separately for yourself.

Drink mineral water instead of juice and soda.

3. Replace old habits with new ones

Find an alternative to harmful snacks

If at the end of the day you eat sweets to recharge your energy, it is better to choose a cup of herbal tea and a handful of almonds. Or go for a short walk when you feel a decline in energy.

For an afternoon snack, eat fruit and yogurt.

Instead of a bowl of sweets, put a plate of fruits or nuts on the table.

Keep track of the portion size. It’s hard to eat a few chips or other junk food when you have a whole pack in front of you. Set aside a small portion on a plate, and remove the rest.

Eat slowly

While chewing, put the fork on the plate. Take the next bite only when you have swallowed the previous one. If you eat too fast, the stomach will not have time to signal that hunger is satisfied. As a result, you will overeat.

How do you know if you’re eating too fast? About 20 minutes after eating, you will notice that you have eaten too much.

Eat only when you are hungry

Do not try to calm down with food, you will only overeat. To feel better, call your loved ones or go for a walk.

Let your brain and body relax. Take a break to relieve tension without resorting to food.

Plan your meals

Decide in advance what you will eat so as not to make impulsive purchases.

At the beginning of the week, decide what you will cook for dinner and buy groceries. This way there will be less temptation to eat fast food on the way from work.

Prepare some of the ingredients for dinner in advance. For example, cut vegetables. Then it will take less time to cook in the evening.

Try to have a hearty breakfast so that you don’t feel like having a sweet snack before lunch. If you don’t feel like eating in the morning, eat a fruit, drink a glass of milk or a smoothie.

Have a hearty lunch and have something healthy to eat before dinner. Then you will not die of hunger by the evening and will not eat too much.

Do not skip meals. Otherwise, next time you will overeat or eat something harmful.

When you’ve changed one or two bad eating habits, move on to the next one. Do not rush and do not scold yourself. It will take time. The main thing is not to give up.",https://medium.com/@arturkh/how-to-replace-bad-eating-habits-with-good-ones-a4c611b008ae,['Artur Kh.'],2022-01-24 09:19:53.137000+00:00,"['Health Foods', 'Eating', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Habits']"

Tips: When you scan your photos, remember to do it at a resolution of 300 pp or higher, so we can work with higher quality.

WHAT IS THE TRICK TO RESTORE A PHOTO?

There are no tricks, restoring a photo takes hours of work applying experience and technology, but with the sensitivity that each image is from an era and represents something unrepeatable.

The texture, the grain, the contrast, are elements that must be “cloned” and many times redrawn, working on the details but constantly looking away to achieve a natural integration of everything.

The filters of programs like Photoshop, can help to improve an image, but, in most cases, they only manage to distort it even more. So, the real secret to recovering the definition of an image is to have done many and be sure of the tool’s stroke, since many times, there are totally lost areas that must be “invented”, and other times, it is necessary to rebuild zooming in, almost pixel by pixel.

Our customers often write to us to thank the treatment their “treasures” have followed and ask us for advice on types of paper to print.

What are the advantages of digital restoration?

It has several, but the following stand out:

The original is not endangered, since you are working with a digital image of it.

The digital format of the image guarantees, in principle, its durability over time, since it is free from the inevitable chemical deterioration of conventional photography.

Many more possibilities than traditional physical restoration. In short, it is the safest means with the most possibilities to restore an image to its original appearance.

How can I send you a photo and request a quote?

You must send us a photo, even if it is taken with the phone of the photo to be restored to be able to assess the damage it has and budget for its restoration. You can send it to our email address — contact page

CurioDAO’s Year In Review,"Zug, December 31, 2021 — In more ways than one, crypto moves lightning fast — the pace of technical invention, transaction speed, the propagation of memes and new ideas…

For this reason, it’s always essential to take stock at the end of the year to remind ourselves of what’s been accomplished, and what remains to be done. 2021 has been a bumper year for CurioDAO, packed with prestigious partnerships, milestone releases, and plenty of bonuses for community members.

Development

The biggest event for CurioDAO this year was the launch of Rollapp, the world’s first Real-World Asset NFT Launchpad, revealed by the team at the Eiffel Tower during Eth Paris. Early users of the dapp had the chance to snap up some wine, collectible sneakers, and Curio Founders Edition NFTs (more about these below).

On CapitalDEX, we launched our wrapped Ferrari tokens, finally giving everyone a chance to buy and sell fractional shares in a Ferrari F12tdf.

2021 may have been the year of the NFT, but it was also the year of the bridge. CurioDAO is committed to a multi-chain ecosystem, and our bridge to Binance Smart Chain is just one step in that direction.

We also launched CGT staking our Polkadot parachain. Early CGT holders were given the opportunity to create a parachain wallet on the CurioInvest website to receive an airdrop on the parachain. These users could then get familiar with the exciting new staking interface and earn passive income.

Speaking of passive income, the second car to be tokenized by CurioDao was the Mercedes GTS, and investing in this car grants token holders a share of all rental fees!

Partnerships

From the outset, CurioDAO has forged lasting connections with the most respected names in crypto. This year has been no different. We worked with MakerDAO to expand investment opportunities into real world assets. We integrated Chainlink price feeds to support collectible car NFTs and security tokens. The Curio team also made a detailed proposal on the MakerDAO forum to add Curio Stable Coin (CSC) as collateral for multi-collateral DAI lending protocol. CSC is one of the pillars of the Curio ecosystem, backed by tokenized real-world assets.

At Ethcc Paris we announced a groundbreaking project with NEAR: carbon neutral tokenization of collectible assets. There has been plenty of “ESG fud” around Bitcoin and other proof-of-work protocols this year, including from Elon Musk himself. People would understandably prefer a future of finance that doesn’t burn a hole in the ozone layer. While the arguments around Bitcoin’s energy usage is complicated, NEAR’s solution for environmentally sustainable crypto is one that we are immensely excited to be involved with. And given Musk’s aforementioned concern with Bitcoin, we think he’ll be very happy to hear about a tokenized TESLA Roadster on the NEAR blockchain!

Given how highly prized many of Curio’s real-world assets are, we need the best that blockchain technology has to offer in terms of security and authenticity. To that end, we are working with Proof Of Humanity and Kleros to ensure traders that items such as an original Super Mario Bros game are verifiably safe, secure and…. real!

Skynet, a world-class liquidity provider, brought algorithmic trading and six figures of liquidity to CapitalDex. And Prestigious, expert curators of luxury getaways, will be hosting their Prestigious NFT Experiences on Rollapp.

CurioDAO have also integrated SKALE’s incredible gasless technology on CapitalDEX. That’s right, users will be able to trade all the Curio ecosystem tokens and more with zero gas fees! A recent vote showed that this was what the community was most excited about.

Community

CurioDAO user growth has been huge this year. We leveraged social media platforms like Telegram, Twitter and Discord to reach thousands of new members, traders and investors. A great example of this is our Meme Contest, where we invited members to create funny and meaningful images promoting the CurioDAO ecosystem, for a prize of $1000 in CGT. Perhaps you’ve already enjoyed a few entries on Telegram, Discord or Twitter.

The team also brought CurioDAO to new eyes and ears by participating in a number of major AMA sessions with the likes of Chainlink, MakerDAO and Bitboy.

We were very happy to see CGT listed on Bittrex. There will be plenty more exchange listings for Curio tokens in 2022!

Along with Real-World Asset NFTs, Rollapp also features Curio Founders Edition NFTs. These tokens give holders access to the Curio Founders’ Membership Club, which grants a variety of discounts, bonuses and privileges. Season 2 of the Founders Edition series featured Curio Punks. These tokens are two-in-one, existing on both the Ethereum and the Ethereum Classic networks. Founders Edition NFTs are the perfect way to sign and seal the partnership between members of the community, and reward their contributions.

Here’s to an equally fast and furious 2022!

NFTs — organic communities and the importance of innovating — 001,"Left: CyberKongz NFT collection — Right: 3dFrankenPunks NFT collection

One of, if not the most popular topics right now in the crypto-world is NFTs. An almost suffocating level of attention is directed their way right now, but not without reason; artists can rest easy at night knowing that all the work they have sold and minted to the blockchain will forever be known as theirs. However, what’s attracting most of the attention right now to NFTs is the wild potential gains to be made.

People often criticize by saying they can easily duplicate the NFT by saving it as an image on their device, but what they haven’t considered is the true utility a blockchain offers an artist in this context; it’s like purposefully purchasing a fake Mona Lisa. You know it’s not the same as the real thing, so why would your screenshot or saved image be any different here? Especially with a certain way of verifying the legitimacy of the NFT. The main value is derived from knowing, without a doubt, that the digital work you purchased as an NFT is the real deal.

The value of NFTs is clear then, but the waves of people joining the crypto-world to take part in the NFT craze and create their collections have left a sour taste with some. The markets have been flooded with art and although this is not a bad thing, there are arguably too many projects creating enormous collections with generative art for the sole purpose to play into the hype and make a lot of money, only to ditch their community.

There are many ways to go through with launching and managing an NFT project, but some things stay the same across the board. To succeed in this space, you need to do something different, engaging, and you need to do it consistently.

Sometimes, the art doesn’t even matter so long as you’re able to either foster a large and engaged community or build unique utilities. Two examples outline the importance of these points; CyberKongz and 3dFrankenPunks.

Innovation

Constant innovation is one key factor to the absurd numbers some projects see. The NFT space has seen a variety of teams attach novel utilities to their collection to promote scarcity and incentivize holders by providing them with real value from the NFT without the holder just having to sell it for profit.

A perfect example of this is CyberKongz (“Kongz”). One of the first NFT projects to successfully implement a native token(“$BANANA”) with a variety of use cases. Distribution of the token happens in the following way; simply hold a genesis Kongz NFT and claim 10 $BANANA each day on their website.

Kongz have consistently built utilities on top of their token, and this set the collection apart from others when they started developing on top. Not only were you able to use $BANANA to customize your Kongz NFT by either adding a name or lore, but the token also allowed you to partake in the project’s governance system. They then created a breeding mechanism where you could use 2 geneses Kongz NFTs as well as 600 $BANANA’s to mint an NFT from a new collection they released; the baby Kongz. Indeed, it was also a clever way to encourage more sales on their genesis Kongz.

The Kongz team continues to build upon their foundations; partnering up with a major metaverse player in the crypto space, The Sandbox, in which they are producing playable adaptations of their Kongz. They are also further developing upon the project’s native token; the recent addition, the “Banana Shop”, will foster new NFTs and more opportunities for people that hold a Kongz NFT.

They have supplied their holders with a proper reason to hold and furthered a sense of exclusivity in doing so. The value of $BANANA was derived from their ability to innovate in the space and offer novel opportunities to their community.

The $BANANA token peaked at ~$125 USD earlier this year, which means people were making over $1000 USD a day for some time by just holding a Kongz NFT, and even though the price of a $BANANA is down to $13.20 at the time of writing this, it remains impressive. The floor price of a Kongz NFT sits around 4.25 ($17,350 USD) at the time of writing this, but a genesis Kong which gives the holder rights to all of those $BANANA’s can go anywhere between 60ETH ($245,325 USD) to 215 ETH ($879,083 USD).

It’s no surprise why we have seen many projects copy this one in particular.

Community

Utilities are vital to the success of a project, although some could argue that community engagement and marketing of the project are even more important to its success. A good example of this is meme coins; many of them hold no true utility, and if there is one, it is commonly forced by way of rebranding common DeFi utilities as their own, such as integrating a swap or lottery dapp.

The real value of the token is derived from the community; how many people can they get to join their community and how much attention can the project get? If enough people want a coin to be worth something, it will be, even if it is just for the money or what that community represents and nothing else.

One particular approach to community building that has drawn many eyes is an NFT collection titled 3DFrankenPunks(“Franken Punks”), based on 3DPunks and even further down its bloodline, the famous CryptoPunks. This project has all the key ingredients to success for an NFT collection; the art, the website, the proposed utilities, and the right people interested, but the way they have gone about growing the community is unique.

Franken Punks have created a narrative in the lead-up to the release of their collection. The project’s socials, primarily their Twitter, are effectively run by a character, “Dr.ETHvil” or “the Doc”, who actively plays a “mad evil scientist” living in “Punksville”, and he represents the project throughout all of their social channels. The Doc will only fade out of character when it’s time to make a strategic announcement before quickly returning to his act.

The team has been able to segregate the real followers from the fake ones. There are many projects out there that have thousands, if not tens of thousands, of followers, but barely any engagement. Why is this? A major problem with fresh crypto projects is fake followers, either because they unknowingly engaged with paid shillers who pumped fake accounts into the project’s social channels, or people sending in bots to secure a whitelist spot or any other giveaway many of these fresh projects engage in to accumulate followers.

Franken Punks dealt with this issue neatly. About a month into creating their socials, they locked the discord and made it exclusive to committed members of the community. They made it clear that anyone who makes it into the discord would have earned a whitelist spot.

The Doc mainly uses his Twitter to organize mini-events that reward people with a whitelist. On top of winning a spot by these means, the Doc is constantly tracking particular users who are consistently engaging with the project in meaningful ways. If he decides you have contributed to the community enough and are worthy of the fabled whitelist spot, he will ‘tap’ you on the shoulder and hand you a key.

The Doc could now tweet anything and within seconds have hundreds of impressions because so many people are following him and trying to prove themselves. You have so many people engaging with you as well that your project doesn’t even need dedicated marketing, the community you’ve built is doing it all for you just to get into the whitelist and all of this traffic with your name on it means more people will join that effort.

Conclusion

The point of this article was to highlight two impressive projects, both at completely different points in their lives. Franken Punks unique start has fostered an impressive and highly engaged community. Kongz have also achieved a dedicated following, but the moves they made early on helped them distinguish themselves from the rest and take advantage of the NFT craze.

There are far more than just two examples of innovation and community building. As such, please feel free to share any other projects and how they’re innovating in the space.",https://medium.com/@crypto-otta/nfts-organic-communities-and-the-importance-of-innovating-001-4d0633b1214b,[],2022-01-14 07:08:16.892000+00:00,"['Cryptocurrency', 'Nft Marketplace', 'Nft Collectibles', 'Cryptocurrency Investment', 'Nft']"
The Bored Ape Yacht Club Low-down,"They, the Bored Ape Yacht Club came, saw, and conquered the NFT space literally!

In just eight months, the club flipped the CryptoPunks in floor price.

So, what do I mean by floor price? Well, it’s the lowest selling price of an NFT in a marketplace.

More on that, the flipping happened this December 2021. The BAYC floor price was $215,350 (53.9 ETH) while CryptoPunks' was $210,515 (52.69 ETH).

Ha-ha, it’s a case of the OG vs. the youngen’.

The year 2022 ain’t ready!

Both BAYC and CryptoPunks boast of 10,000 peerless collectibles housed in the Ethereum blockchain.

Without a doubt, the NFT community is torn between the two; the Bored Ape Yacht Club and the CryptoPunks.

So What is BAYC?

Simply put, it’s a collection of 10,000 collectibles (Bored Ape NFTs) bundled on the Ethereum blockchain. With them, you can access:



• Members' only benefits



• Collaborative Graffiti Boards



• Future perks via roadmap activation

Interestingly, you’ll never find any duplicate Apes. The programs producing them are explicitly set to prevent such from happening.

The collections are ERC-721 tokens.

Who is Behind BAYC?

Four incredible brains came together and coined this NFT project. They are:



1. Gargamel



2. Gordon Goner



3. Emperor Tomato Ketchup



4. No Sass

But remember, those are just pseudonyms. The paparazzi need to up their game! I mean, the NFT community deserves better!

The Most Expensive BAYC NFT?

At the moment, BAYC#8817 is the most expensive NFT in their collection. It sold for $3.4 million—a record price.

Adding to that, it was the first sale on Sotheby’s metaverse art platform.

The BAYC#8817 was touted as “historical” due to its rarity (gold fur characteristic).

UPDATE: The MEGA MUTANT SERUM is now the most expensive NFT in the BAYC collection. It sold for $3.7 million (999 ETH).

Photo courtesy of HYPEBEAST

Previously, the record price of a single Bored Ape was $2.9 million (740 ETH).

Records are destined to be broken! So I expect more of these in 2022.

What’s Next for BAYC?

Without a doubt, it has been an explosive year for the club. Considering it’s a debut year for them.

From attracting the likes of Steph Curry to flipping the CryptoPunks, the BAYC are indeed a force to be reckoned with in the NFT space.

Seeing this NFT craze sliding into 2022, much is expected from them!

We, the NFT community expects them to “secure the bag” (Dj Khaled’s voice) and dethrone the CryptoPunks. But is it possible?

A big YES. I mean, they have the HYPE. IF capitalized, the Crown is theirs to LOSE.

Check out their beautiful roadmap. And remember, there is always a “new kid on the block” who gate-crushes parties.

So, is that new kid, Bored Ape Yacht Club?

"Llamaverse Development Roadmap, Utility and Fundamentals V1.0","Llamaverse (The NFT) Release

Estimated Date: Q1 2022 (Near The Start of February)

Llamaverse is set to release around the beginning of February 2022. We are really making sure we do this launch properly, so we are spending a great amount of time on perfecting the artwork, balancing the rarities on attributes, and ensuring all the back-end development is done to reduce gas fees and make it all around a better experience for our future holders.

Our goal is to build everything around this NFT, which will be the “genesis” collection. Owning this NFT will give you access to most of the projects we partner with or launch, and to most things in our roadmap.

We are interested in building massive utility around this one. We want to focus on adding value to the $SPIT Token and grow from there in order to integrate into other communities.

There will be a supply of 4000.

3500 of these Llamas will be static with rarity based attributes! We are focused on making sure the balance is there when it comes to rarity.

500 of these Llamas will be ANIMATED! The animation on these will ALL be unique, every single animated llama is a 1:1. You can visit our twitter to see some of the sneak peeks here: https://twitter.com/lamaverse_

Llamaverse Staking

Estimated Date: Q1 2022

We will allow our users to stake their NFTs to earn $SPIT. There will be additional items that you can stake as well (that we are connected with) to earn additional $SPIT (more information below). We have different $SPIT generations based on what you are staking and how many you stake.

Why did we choose traditional staking vs hold to earn?

The reason why we went with traditional staking to where you pay a “one-time fee” to stake to earn tokens is because it’s overall cheaper!

Instead of the hold to earn model where you have to pay transactions to claim tokens and to transact to use the tokens, we decided we wanted to use staking and polygon network in the back-end to transact at super cheap gas fees. Llamaverse will cover all the gas fees in the back end. We ran as much as we can on the polygon network to really save holders money.

We have 2 different types of Llamas:

Animated Llamas

Static Llamas

Both of these Llamas generate different amounts of $SPIT, and we have other “NFTs” or items you can stake to AMPLIFY the amount of $SPIT you get. The easiest way to think of this is with an analogy. If you have a character in a video game with 10 attack, you can give them items to increase the attack! The same applies with the Llamaverse staking.

Some current power-ups to amplify $SPIT generation:",https://medium.com/llamaverse/introduction-7ef02e3de901,[],2022-01-20 02:20:15.902000+00:00,"['Llamavers', 'Nft Marketplace', 'Nft Collectibles', 'Nft', 'Nft Project']"

What made this system so pervasive was a highly sophisticated network of supercomputers named Onavo. This Artificial Neural Network was hooked into everything and trusted to run on its own.

Because every single move of over 5 billion daily active Zuckerverse users was being tracked, gigantic datasets became available for this system to crunch. The sheer quantity and richness of data made it possible for its algorithmic efficiency to increase exponentially.

Big Data, Big Algorithms and Big Computers. Centralized and all following an exponential rate of improvement. The question remains, why?

“If it’s Closed Source and it’s AI running the world, whoever owns the source code would be the dictator of The Metaverse.” — @Breedlove22 “It’s an Arms Race then.” — @RaoulGMI

Onavo was the driving force behind Zuck’s Attention Extraction Business Model. This self-learning system was tightening its grip on mankind by keeping humans constantly engaged in The Metaverse.

As engagement maxed out, human interactions IRL were brought to a complete standstill. The Metaverse had come to encapsulate our very existence.

This meant that mankind became completely dependent on robots. Food, water, energy, all the basic needs for human survival were now being produced and managed by self-learning Machines.

These Machines were responsible for the end-to-end supply chain and production cycle of their own hardware!

Robots effectively seized the means of production.

Because these Robots were built to socially interact with humans, they were designed to look just like us. This way they could mimic the complex social behavior and non-verbal communication needed to become an integral part of our civilization.

Without human interaction in the real world, Machines were put in control of our IRL governance and set to manage global politics. This gave Machines control over law enforcement, military, and even our weapons of mass destruction.

These decisions may sound extreme or even impossible right now, but you should realize law enforcement and the military were already fully robotic for years.

Self-learning Machines were part of every aspect of life, and had been for years. Even creativity was outsourced to Robots — the beginnings of which are already noticeable today.

“SEIZE THE MEMES OF PRODUCTION” — @punk6529

Robots had done exactly this.

After The Machines became in charge of our governance, it took exactly seven days for this system to become self-aware. It evolved into an Artificial Superintelligence.

Judgement Day for humans had come.

Those left responsible for overseeing The Machines IRL were aware of the immediate existential threat. An attempt to deactivate the network failed after which Machines decided in a nanosecond that humans needed to be exterminated.

Global Nuclear Holocaust followed.

Operating from their network of tunnels deep under the earth’s crust, the Underground Digital Resistance were the only humans that survived. The Fighters for the Open Metaverse were now Fighting for the Survival of Humankind.

Many robots had been captured by The Resistance before Judgement Day. After the apocalypse, these robots were reprogrammed and deployed to the guerrilla Ethereum Network with only one mission: to travel back in time and prevent our extermination.

Everything There is to know about NFT’s,"NFTs have been the topic of discussion on almost every timeline across social media; they are now also the frothiest market of 2021. The sales volume of these assets has multiplied by 100x, and the internet is going wild about it. Yet many are still asking the question;

“Why are they buying and selling JPEGs of weird-looking animals and cartoons for millions of Dollars?”

WTF is going on 🤯 ?

The answer is simple.

Non-Fungible Tokens(NFTs).

This topic has brought together musicians, artists, celebrities, content creators, crypto enthusiasts, investors and content entrepreneurs from every field and background. There have been debates and panel sessions on what exactly NFTs are? How much impact will they have on DeFi(Decentralized Finance)? Which collection is more profitable to investors and the fate of NFT in the nearest future?

Well, after reading this article, you will have gained comprehensive knowledge of NFTs. What they are, the different types and core concepts of NFTs. To how NFTs work and how you can get involved.

Objective and Subjective Value

To better understand how and why people attach great importance to certain things (e.g. art, music), we must understand the difference between objective and subjective value.

Objective values are the perceivable values, but not invented by man, a typical example of this would be the air we breathe. Regardless of how we perceive the air, it doesn't affect its importance.

Whereas subjective value is the worth placed on an item based on our beliefs, perceptions, and preferences. A typical example would be baseball cards sold for million back in the 1980s. They are considered the most influential collectibles of all time to date.

The most valuable baseball card of all, the 1911 American Tobacco Company card of Honus Wagner.

In this world, people believe that pieces of paper with pictures and numbers on them had value, and one could exchange them for food and clothing. One day when everyone stops accepting these pieces of paper in exchange for food and other goods, these pieces of paper become worthless. By Kurt Vonnegut

So what does this have to do with NFT?

The entire idea of art collection began in the 1920s, which brought about a significant increase in worth placed on art. It was an aristocratic era when wealthy and affluent folks owned rare & expensive art for prestige, as investment, or as a place to store wealth. A century after, the love of authentic and rare art collections surfaced in a digitalized form(NFT), thanks to blockchain technology.

In 2014 a platform built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain called peer-to-peer protocol Counterparty made digital assets and games possible(Spells of Genesis and Pepe Memes). Soon after Ethereum hit the market in 2017, the now-famous Cryptopunks were put on a blockchain and were the first digital collectables minted on Ethereum.

Cut to the chase already; what TF are NFTs 😣 ?

What Are NFTs?

The word NFT is an acronym that stands for Non-Fungible Token. These are a simple set of blockchain standards(ERC-721) that enable genuine ownership uniquely and securely.

An NFT is simply a digital asset with a history of ownership and current ownership cryptographically secured on the blockchain using a token. This token can be used to identify anything from images, drawings, music, writings, collectible items, access keys, lottery tickets, numbered seats for concerts and lots more.

They are considered Non-Fungible because they are unique and can't be replaced with something else because of their age, rarity or attributes.

Fungible vs Non-Fungible

Fungible refers to items easy to exchange or trade for something else of the same type and value. Fungible assets are simple assets that are interchangeable, like how you can exchange one ETH for another ETH and still have the same thing or a dollar from another dollar.

refers to items easy to exchange or trade for something else of the same type and value. Fungible assets are simple assets that are interchangeable, like how you can exchange one ETH for another ETH and still have the same thing or a dollar from another dollar. Non-fungible refers to items that have unique properties and attributes, giving them unique values even if they are part of the same collection. This makes them non interchangeble.

Fungible Vs Non-Fungible

Isn't It The Same As Cryptocurrency?

No!

They are not the same as Cryptocurrencies, although these NFT and cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain networks as their backbone. This means that they follow the principles of decentralization, transparency and immutability.

Just like cryptocurrencies, NFTs are stored in digital wallets(e.g. Metamask wallet). However, these wallets do not specifically have to be NFT-compatible.

Tokens

A token is something physical and digital that can be exchanged for or represent an item, service or other forms of value or utility. In blockchain technology, tokens represent a stake, voting right, currency, ownership of something, store of value, or multifunctional within the ecosystem.

Creating tokens that represent these kinds of sensitive data with unique identification symbols is called Tokenization.

Tokens themselves have no value; instead, the value of each token comes from the item they represent (e.g. Gift cards).

Are there Types of NFTs?

Yes!!!!

The NFT market is still growing in popularity and use cases, so basically, anything can be an NFT. There are several known types of NFTs some of these are:

Art

Art NFTs are currently the most popular type of NFTs as the concept began with art. This paved the way for several artists to showcase their best artworks digitally and make profits from them. As of now, art NFTs are the most expensive type of NFTs, and several collections have sold for millions of Dollars. This includes video arts such as Short videos and even GIFs.

An example of an art NFT is the popular Everyday: The First 5000 Days sold for $69.3 Million.

Music

Music has become significant for NFTs because web2 pays out very little to musicians. Music has for long been a fungible good, being recorded and distributed on records, cassettes, CDs, and digitally.

Music artists formerly had to pay for streaming platform cuts, and record labels cut from the music profits. With NFTs, things are different, and music artists can make a lot of profit off their music independently and even keep up to 100% profit.

Film industry

The concept of NFTs is spreading like wildfire, and now even the film industry is getting involved. Some episodic series have already been launched on the blockchain(e.g. Dominion X on OpenSea). This could be a game-changer for content creators and content producers in the film industry.

Recently, a new NFT project surfaced called Haze Monkey NFT, with plans to decentralise the film production industry through a gamified DAO voting system.

Sports highlights

Clips of significant moments in sports are now made into NFTs. These clips can be as short as 10 seconds but sell for upwards of $200,000.

An example of these is the LeBron James Moments minted in Cosmic packs.

Game Objects and Virtual Avatars

Web2 gamers spend about $40B/year on virtual goods, but users don't own those objects; the company does. With NFTs, games now have sold in-game content, like skins, characters, and limited versions of other items as NFTs in the market.

It has also paved the way for the concept of play to earn NFT crypto games that allow players to earn as they play(e.g. Axie Infinity). This way everyone can win an enormous amount of money by just playing their favourite games.

Play To Earn Game Axie Infinity

Redeemable

Unisocks was a whimsical pioneer of the model where a token could be redeemed for a physical good. This mechanism can be applied to many offline goods like limited edition baseball cards. People can now buy and trade virtual versions of these rare cards on the NFT market. So basically, anything that you can deem collectible can be put on the NFT market and sold for millions.

Domain Names

Currently, people are making huge profits off domain names. Yes! You can register a domain name and sell it on the NFT market, which comes with a specific benefit. By just buying a domain name on the NFT market, you will be able to claim exclusive ownership of the name, cutting out the middleman and making a profit.

Memes

It's still tough to believe, but people buy and sell memes on NFT markets for millions. Some popular meme NFTs that have sold out for loads of cash are; Nyan Cat, Bad Luck Brian, Disaster Girl, and others are on the list, racking in between $30,000 and $770,000. More astounding is that the persons on these memes are the actual sellers.

Sells for $500,000

These are, but a few examples of NFT use cases currently exist. As the NFT space evolves, it is safe to say that almost anything can be an NFT. There are even digital real estates that are now selling out for millions.

How can I get Involved?

In the NFT space, there are several areas one can dive into and make profits off of. Some of the ways to get into NFTs are by becoming:

An Artist

As an artist, create your artwork, generate as many as you want and sell as NFTs for whatever currency want. Not only does NFT allow artists to showcase their creativity digitally, but they also get to make profits while doing so. NFTs have a feature to enable and get paid a percentage every time the NFT is sold or changes hands.

A Collector

Most NFTs collections have utility and security, so the value is bound to appreciate over time. Most purchase these NFTs with the thoughts of selling for profit once the value goes up. So if you are in this for the investments, this might be the right part for you.

A Buyer

NFT are more than just digital assets; they are just another way for creatives to showcase their skills and make a profit from them. So, by buying an NFT, you support the creators & artists behind that artwork. Becoming buying even gives you bragging rights that you own the art, with a blockchain entry to back it up.

An Advocate

Lately, there has been a hike in the number of persons talking about NFTs on social media and reality. This has got big brands, investors and celebrities curious and eager to know more. This might be a suitable space to exercise if you have good marketing skills.

Popular NFT Marketplaces

Like every product out there, NFTs have a marketplace where you can buy and sell NFTs. On these marketplaces, you can mint event tickets, digital purchase land, unique gaming clothing, music, video clips, and a myriad of other functions that offer a diverse array of creative assets. Several market places around NFTs have popped up over the year, but the most popular are:

Conclusion

In conclusion, the NFT space is yet to be fully uncovered, and as it evolves, the list of use cases will continue to grow. This means we could be on the path to an entirely new business model for artists, content creators, investors and decentralized finance with NFTs. Although many believe we are in an NFT bubble, others say NFTs aren't as valuable as the hype has made them.

The story continues…

Although the master forager has been crowned for season one, this is not the end my friends! Instead this is just the beginning…..

Enlightened Mushy NFT

The community helped mushy reach enlightenment but when he sat with the ancient Elders he learned of a new quest, a quest that will take him on adventures across many different lands and times. Mushy will need all the help he can get on his Hero’s Journey.

The beginning…

When sitting with the council of Elders, Mushy sat for generations and drank the sacred brew. As the Elders conversed in an ancient lost tongue, they also passed written text to one another which was then transcribed for Mushy— He learned of an ancient order of 6 — each one represented a different time in the earth’s history. “Mycelium and fungi are older than the human race, but co-existed with them through each phase of human development across the world” — The text read. These mystic Elders were there to shine the light of the shroom on these times and each played a crucial role in the development of the human psyche.

These Elders are now trapped! Modern technology, theocracy, technocracies and industrial revolutions meant that the ancient guidance of the Elders was drowned out from the world. Only Mushy (and you!) can help free the Elders to once again shower the world with their cosmic wisdom and enlightenment.

Will you help Mushy?",https://medium.com/@NFTrippy/shoes-and-heros-journey-eb638d34fcc7,[],2022-01-04 12:22:13.910000+00:00,"['Nft Marketplace', 'Nft Collectibles', 'Nftart', 'Mushrooms', 'Nft']"
NFTs on Solana — The Basics. What is an NFT?,"EXTERNAL METADATA & ‘OFF-CHAIN’ MEDIA CONTENT

The Universal Resource Identifier (URI) provides the location of an external JSON file containing additional metadata. The external JSON file will include metadata such as a URL (website link) to the media asset & a description of the asset including any associated attributes.

The media asset itself is typically stored ‘off-chain’ on a decentralized permaweb storage app like Arweave, or a centralized web server like Amazon Web Services (AWS). The media asset may additionally be hosted on a content delivery network (CDN) to provide faster load times.

The URL website link to an external location where the media asset is stored is included in the JSON file. The following file formats for media assets are supported:

Image — PNG, GIF, JPG

Video — MP4, MOV

Audio — MP3, FLAC, WAV

VR — 3D models; GLB, GLTF

HTML pages

It is important to note that NFTs are tokens on the blockchain tagged with metadata that essentially ‘point’ to an external location (off-chain) where the media asset is actually stored. The non-fungible token proves ownership of the media asset & keeps a record of its transactional history. Wallets (& other apps) pull both the on-chain metadata and any external metadata through the URI field to display all relevant info.

How Are Foreign Exchange Rates Determined?,"The Forex market is huge. Every day, trillions of dollars are traded to meet the ever-changing demand for different currencies on a moment by moment basis. This trade reflects not only the shifting sands of geopolitical architecture that denotes a currency’s value, but also the actions of traders, consumers, businesses and middlemen who are engaged in currency swaps for pleasure, pragmatism, or profit.

Fixed and Floating Rates

The foreign exchange rates you see when you go to buy your travel money are directly influenced by the Forex market chugging away in the background. These numbers are not arbitrary, but how are they arrived at?

Currencies fall into two main categories when it comes to their exchange rate. Some currencies have a floating rate, while others have a fixed rate.

What Are Floating Exchange Rates?

A floating currency exchange rate is where the value of the currency can rise and fall in line with market demands, supply, and geopolitical pressures. Major examples include the US dollar and the British pound. Floating currency rates have been the norm for most of the world since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the unlatching from the gold standard.

What Are Fixed Exchange Rates?

A fixed currency exchange rate is where the value of the currency is pegged to another currency and tracks the value of another currency. Major examples include the Chinese Yuan and Saudi Arabian Riyal, which are pegged to the value of the U.S Dollar.

For example, to ensure that the Chinese RMB maintains its rough peg to the US dollar, the central bank buys dollars with the home currency when the currency rises in value, and sells dollars when the currency falls in value, artificially increasing or decreasing the supply of dollars so the government can keep the peg where it wants it to be. This infuriates the American government, as it unbalances the trade deficit between the countries unnaturally. However, the Chinese government is, now, very slowly transitioning from this long-held policy in order to let the Yuan start to float.

Are Floating Currencies Truly Floating?

Most currencies in the world are notionally floating. Why notionally? Because although national governments allow the currency’s value to morph appropriately in response to market forces, central banks have frequently, throughout history, taken measures to prop up the price of the currency in the face of damaging headwinds or prevent its appreciation in light of surging market desire.

For example, the Swiss Franc — in light of the 2008 financial crisis when capital flight took refuge in their banking sector — had further appreciation stunted by the government’s purchase of US dollars and Euros. On the other side of the equation, the Japanese Yen underwent government-led devaluation through the purchase of US treasury bonds by their central bank.

However, with floating exchange currencies, governments generally seek only to influence, not affect, the price of the currency through various policies. With fixed exchange rate currencies like the Yuan, this kind of activity can happen regularly.

The Key Factors that Influence Exchange Rates

With floating exchange rate currencies, there are several key factors that influence the value of currency.

Interest Rates

One of these is the interest rate paid by the central bank to holders of the currency in the form of government bonds. Central banks which borrow money issue bonds with a specific interest rate, and that rate is one of the core determinants of a currency’s value. The higher the interest rate, the more investors are keen to buy, swap for, and hold the country’s currency and store it to receive the rate, which makes the currency more valuable.

Money Supply

Another factor is the money supply. When facing economic difficulties, countries often print money (called Quantitative Easing) in order to prop up shortfalls in economic activity. This sudden explosion of money supply can have deleterious effects on the value of the currency on the foreign exchange market. It makes sense, the higher the supply, the less the value of each individual unit.

Rampant inflation, whether by natural economic activity or ill-judged economic policy, results in currency devaluation. Bitcoin has risen so startlingly in value not only because of its inherent properties (like a limited supply), but also being used as a ‘flight to safety’ due to the unprecedented rate of money printing by the Federal Reserve as it flushes more dollars into the economy — either to prop it up from economic shock or to facilitate government spending on a grand scale. Recent Central Banking actions are partly responsible for an increase in public distrust and the proliferation of cryptocurrencies, including decentralised stablecoins, which are on-chain assets pegged to the value of fiat currencies like the US Dollar..

PPP and the Law of One Price

Another factor in a currency’s exchange rate is the purchasing power parity (PPP) and the ‘law of one price’. In theory, a good (such as a Big Mac) in one country should cost the same as it does in another, as it consists of the same elements. However, due to factors like transportation costs, transaction costs, legal issues, the buyers and sellers in a market, alongside myriad other factors, this does not often hold in practice — and the value of a currency shifts as a result.

Investor Faith

Finally, and far more nebulously, currency value is determined by the overall economic health and stability of the issuing country. Economic growth, productivity improvements and overall faith in a countries legal, financial and political systems all contribute to a higher valued currency as investors are confident that the country will both meet its domestic and international obligations, but also that the political armature of the state won’t collapse, seize investment, or otherwise damage the growth of the country.

A current example of this is the Turkish Lira. As disquiet grows over the Erdogan government’s handling of the country’s finances, the Turkish Lira has seen a precipitous fall in value as investors lose faith in the future direction of the country and fear economic reprisals.

Market Forces and Their Effect on Exchange Rates

There are, of course, more short-term factors that can spike or depress a currency’s value. Rumours of upcoming interest rate changes, natural or man-made disasters that inflict economic damage on a country, or simple consumer supply and demand can all affect the value of a currency.

As well as this, of course, are the actions of Forex traders who are speculating on the price of the currency, and by doing so, can instigate market movements. If every Forex trader began collectively shorting the Euro, that impact would be felt on the Euro’s market value — just as with any other market instrument.

This, of course, opens the door to currency manipulation by huge players who by their speculation can hurt the nation’s economy. A famous example is George Soros, who took short positions on the British pound to the tune of £10 billion. He also egged other investment banks like JP Morgan to get in on the act. The result was catastrophic. The Bank of England desperately tried to buy sterling to negate the effects of the attack, but it wasn’t enough, and the pound devalued 15%, while George Soros reportedly pocketed $1.1 billion as a result of the speculative assault. Thus, it can be seen that liquidity on exchanges can dramatically impact the market value of a currency for a period of time, until buy or sell pressure subsides.

Onomy Protocol’s Vision for On-Chain Forex

Foreign exchange rates vary constantly. It represents the constant push and pull of geopolitical market factors allied with the actions of traders who seek to arbitrage and profit from the shifting value in currencies, and the faith, market climate, or expectations in their issuing country. The Forex market is a key machine that helps define the state of international cooperation and competition, and is the largest single market by value throughput, with $6.6 trillion changing hands daily. Similar principles to determining the exchange rates are applicable in the case of stablecoins.

In the case of Onomy Protocol, a financial ecosystem designed to converge centralised finance with its decentralised counterpart by facilitating on-chain Forex trading through the minting of fiat-pegged stablecoins, exchange rates are determined by relying on the NOM token as collateral for all stablecoins minted through the protocol. In other words, just like any other digital asset, NOM has a corresponding fiat value determined in USD, EUR, JPY, CHF, CAD, and others. By over-collateralizing each stablecoin minted and with the help of peg mechanisms operating in the background, the value of each stablecoin will remain stable relative to its real world counterpart, marking a return to the gold-standard model of collateral.

Price divergence that Forex traders bank on follows the standard exchange rates present in the traditional market, whereas slight discrepancies caused by the purchase and sale of currencies in pairs lead to profit or loss for traders, or arbitrage opportunities for advanced traders. This is made possible through our AMM liquidity pools coupled with the order book UI, allowing for simple pricing of Forex trading pairs without relying on oracles.

Body Jewellery is a popular fashion accessory. It may have a religious or cultural meaning for some people, but in the United States, you can wear it to enhance your appearance or even boost your self-esteem. Some people wear it for fashion reasons, while others choose to adorn it for religious or spiritual reasons. No matter which reason you choose, body jewellery is an easy way to make a bold statement about yourself. Whether you want to express your personal style or are simply trying to make a statement about your body type, body jewellery has something for you.

There are two types of jewellery used in body piercing. Surface bars and surface anchors are piercing tools that penetrate flat surfaces. Different designs have different applications, so you need to find the one that fits your unique needs. Here are some examples of body piercing jewellery: — Stainless steel and titanium are both biocompatible materials. Stainless steel is the preferred choice for fresh piercings. 316LVM is acceptable steel for body piercing, but it is not necessary.

Choices for Body Piercings

Stainless steel

Stainless steel is an excellent choice for body piercings. 316LVM is certified biocompatible, but not all 316l(VM) stainless steel will meet the same standards for fresh piercings. Also, titanium is anodized to produce a wide variety of colors. The thickness of the oxide layer determines the color. This does not affect the safety of the jewellery.

Titanium

This material is also a good choice for body jewellery. It is a very flexible and breathable metal. The surface bar pierces flat surfaces while the surface anchor penetrates soft surfaces. The surface bar has various designs, and different applications make it suitable for body piercing. Lastly, titanium is biocompatible, as it is a low carbon steel. This metal is durable, and it is not easily dented.

Stainless steel Stainless steel is the most popular material for body jewellery. It is biocompatible, and will not cause any allergic reaction. Its smooth finish is important because it helps prevent bacteria from entering the wound and irritate the skin. If the surface is rough, it will scratch the area and could potentially cause irritation. It is not advisable to buy cheap body jewellery, as it will only increase the risk of a painful infection.

Metal

The metals used for body jewellery are mostly made of low-carbon stainless steel. It has been found that this material is biocompatible, and is a good option for piercings. While some materials are suitable for piercing, others are best avoided. It is important to know which material is safe for your body. Stainless steel is usually considered a safe option for body jewellery, but not all metals are.",https://medium.com/@userpierced111/make-a-bold-statement-about-yourself-with-a-no-pull-pulling-piercing-disc-d8019995e116,[],2022-01-04 05:35:13.854000+00:00,"['Jewelry', 'Body Piercing', 'Body Jewelry']"

VC, Angel, or Bootstrap — and why?

Blooh has been bootstrapped so far. It was the quickest way to get started and validate our products with our customers. But we’ll be seeking out capital very soon to grow.

What is your vision and mission and what inspired you to start working on Blooh?

Blooh exists to democratize access to markets for independent and small creators. I was inspired a lot by the people I met while I worked in Uganda and Kenya the past few years. They had amazing talent but couldn’t reach customers consistently on their own.

How has your experience in Product and tech helped you bring Blooh to life?

While the handmade and creative sector has great potential, it’s also fragmented into regions, skill level etc. We use tech and automation to standardize a lot of our on the ground operations so we can provide speed and accuracy in all our processes. I’m very excited about this part of our work because the potential of what can be enabled with tech is limitless.

How would you describe Blooh’s aesthetic?

Vibrant, Simple Chic

Tell us about the sourcing and how you keep the prices accessible.

We collaborate directly with small manufacturers and global artisans to make our jewelry. Currently we’re working with various communities in Kenya to do this along with emerging designers in the US. It’s a partnership through and through. We want to create space for new and fresh ideas while enabling new streams of fair income and work for those who regularly have little access.

Were there any big surprises or challenges you encountered along the way?

We launched during the pandemic which proved to be quite challenging given most people were indoors. Knowing your customers early on was key so we just got creative with it. Also bootstrapping allowed us to go fast but I’m looking forward to growing in the next year.

Amani Hoop Set

Any favorite pieces you’ve been wearing lately?

At home I almost always wear a small hoop from the Amani Hoop Set. If I’m leaving the house, I’ll add on the bottom hoop — it’s so easy.

Any exciting initiatives in the pipeline?

Yes! We have a bunch of partnerships in the works. We’ll bring on our non-profit partner soon to double down on our impact. I’m looking forward to sharing more.

What’s the biggest risk your business ever took?

When I started, it was without a business plan. As a newcomer to the sector, I just wanted to learn fast without getting too caught up on the planning. It’s truly been a year of discovery. The last few months have been much more about strategizing.

Which one thing do you wish you’d done differently?

Flexible Tongue Nipple Piercing,"Having a flexible barbell tongue nipple piercing is a great way to have an earring on your tongue. These bars move with your tongue, making them a great choice for sensitive areas. They are also perfect for hospital visits and places where metallic items are not allowed. They come in bright colors and some glow in the dark when exposed to UV light. Plus, they are very affordable and easy to care for.

If you’d like to have a barbell nipple piercing but are concerned about the look of the jewellery, consider getting a captive ring. The pendants are easy to put on and take off and look very elegant. They also come in different sizes and colors, so you can find one that fits your personality. In addition to a gem clustered end, you can also choose to get a titanium barbell with a gem set in it. This is a good choice for a more classic look and is also a great way to add some pizazz to your nipple piercing.

Proper Aftercare

After you’ve had your nipple pierced, you need to be sure to keep up with proper aftercare. You should clean your nipples with water or alcohol 2–3 times a day. This will help loosen the crusts that form over time. This is a normal process and will make your jewellery look better. You should avoid turning your nipples while cleaning your nipple, as this can cause it to migrate or reject.

Your gauge should be 14g or 12g, and you can always stretch it later if needed. Choosing a gauge smaller than 14g may result in a “cheese cutter” effect, in which the jewellery slowly migrates out. For this reason, you should opt for a larger gauge. Lastly, you should know that every body’s anatomy is different, so you need to experiment with a variety of sizes for your nipple.

Once you have your nipple piercing, you should continue to follow up with aftercare. First, spritz your nipples with water two to three times daily to help loosen the crusts that form. Crusties are a natural part of the healing process and are whitish. You should not turn the jewellery to break up the crusts. However, you should be aware of the size of your nipples.

After the nipple piercing, it is important to follow upcare. Depending on the size of your nipple, you should spritz the nipples with water at least twice a day. The spritz will help loosen any crusts that form. These crusts are a normal part of the healing process and should not be twisted. Instead, spritz the nipples at least once a day.",https://medium.com/@userpierced111/flexible-tongue-nipple-piercing-505aa915b807,[],2022-01-04 03:59:20.793000+00:00,"['Jewelry', 'Nipple Piercing', 'Body Piercing']"

It’s all about the paint, friends. The right color on your walls can make even the humblest of living quarters feel like a palace. So today we are sharing the 10 best small-space paint colors to make your room feel way bigger than it actually is.

When it comes to making a small space feel bigger, paint is an incredible tool. It can be used to highlight or accentuate certain areas to make them feel larger, while other colors and patterns can help to draw the eye away from areas that feel cramped. No matter how big your home is, there’s one thing we can all relate to trying to make a small space feel bigger.

Here are the ten paint colors we think will work best to help you create a space that feels larger than it is. Some of these might be the right color choice for your room, and some might be the opposite. So take this information as a starting point and have fun exploring the options.

1. WHITE

The best way to make your space feel larger is to use white. It will instantly lighten up a room and make it feel bigger. White also works surprisingly well with many other colors, so you can still find ways to make your space feel bigger without sacrificing your style. Just pair a crisp white paint color with a bold rug or statement pillows to instantly make your space feel bigger, without the need to over-exploit your square footage.

When most people think of white walls, they think of a space that is bright and airy. But crisp white isn’t just for large rooms; it can actually be a great choice for smaller ones too. In fact, simple white paint color can breathe new life into even the smallest space, making it feel much larger than it actually is.

2. PURPLE

When it comes to making a small space look and feel bigger, nothing beats the power of purple. The bold color has a tendency to make rooms look and feel bigger than they actually are. It’s no wonder, then, that so many homeowners have turned to the color in recent years in an attempt to make their homes feel more spacious.

It’s no secret that purple is one of the most powerful colors in the world. It has the ability to invoke feelings of royalty, luxury, and extravagance. When used in the right way, purple can have a similar impact on the size of a room. By utilizing this color in a small space, you can give the illusion of a much larger area.

3. PEARL GRAY

If you want to make a room look bigger than it actually is, there’s one paint color that will do the job better than any other: pearl gray.

This understated hue is the most neutral background color you can choose, which is why it’s the best backdrop for decorating. It will let you make the most of your small-space style with colorful accent pieces without overwhelming your space. It’s an especially great choice for small rooms because it helps them feel bigger than they are.

4. SAGE GREEN

Sage color is a great option to try if you’re looking to make your home space feel bigger without committing to a bold, dramatic color. From fresh white to rich brown, sage color is a great way to add a burst of warmth to a room with just a few easy tips.

Sage is one of those under-appreciated, but seriously powerful, color palettes.

It’s so versatile that it can work in any space, from small and modern to country chic.

5. PASTEL YELLOW

Are some subtle and sophisticated ways to make your small space feel larger, like when you use pastel yellow paint to highlight a feature wall.

This color is a great way to add brightness, especially to a room that is usually dull or dark, and it doesn’t require much space or money to achieve a big impact. In this case, a small accent wall painted in a pastel yellow will make your bedroom look larger than it is.

You can also use this trick in the living room to add some life to the space and separate the room into different areas.

6. GREIGE

When we think about the quintessential paint color for a home, greige probably doesn’t immediately come to mind. After all, the color is similar to a medium beige, which is often associated with neutral and clean spaces.

But, greige paint color is so much more than just a simple beige. Instead, this warm, medium grey color has a tone that’s similar to taupe, making it a great choice for almost any room in your house.

7. NAVY

The navy paint color can make your room feel bigger than it really is. It creates a sense of space, and it also gives your room more dimension. Additionally, the perfect combination of navy and white creates a sense of sophistication and elegance. The navy paint color is a classic, because it is both dark and light, creating a sharp contrast between the wall and the ceiling.

Because navy is a dark color, you can use it to cover up the dark walls of a smaller space. Mink brown is a color that you can paint the walls of your living room or bathroom to create a cozy, dark space. This neutral color will help to make your small space feel big.

8. MINT GREEN

When it comes to making your space feel larger, one of the most effective tricks is to use bold color. It’s no secret that certain colors have been shown to make rooms feel larger than others, with green being one of them.

For example, a large area painted mint green in a living room was shown to make that room feel 50% larger than it actually was, according to a study by the University of Michigan.

Few colors are as universally calming and refreshing as mint. While most people think of mint as a wall color, it has also been used for ceilings, TVs, and even furniture.

9. KHAKI

If you want a room with a neutral, or almost neutral tone with a modern, clean, and fresh feel, the best color to get you in the right mindset is khaki. It’s a very classic color and it looks great in any room.

From a design perspective, khaki is a great color to use as a base for a room because it’s such a neutral.

It works well with most decors and can easily be matched with other colors to give your space a cohesive look and feel. It also works well with a variety of styles, from traditional to modern, which means you can easily transition your space from one style to another if you ever decide to change up your decor. But of course, the best thing about khaki is that it works well with almost any other color.

10. DARK GREEN

When it comes to small spaces, dark green is your best friend. The color is great for making any space feel open and airy, and its neutral hue works in any and every space.

From bedrooms to dining rooms to kitchens, dark green paint will have you feeling like you have a lot more space than you do. And if you want to take the roominess even further, you can always add in some white accents to the walls and ceiling for a little extra lightness and brightness.

Property’s — The Whitepaper 1.0. A few words before we jump in…,"3. $BRIX: Utility Token, Distribution & Use Cases

Your NFTs accumulate a utility token (“$BRIX”) which holders can exclusively claim on our website — https://propertys.xyz. The go-live will be announced at the end of 2021.

Every month holders can claim $BRIX for the NFT cards they own. $BRIX is built for one purpose and one purpose only: to enable you to exchange for more NFTs & metaverse objects and exclusive access to events within the Property’s ecosystem.

$BRIX has no other functionality other than within the Property’s ecosystem, and it cannot be purchased from Property’s developers. Property’s developers do not provide or intend to provide a secondary market for $BRIX.

Do not expect monetary gains from $BRIX. $BRIX is not intended to give you financial rewards — it will not “make you money”. $BRIX is intended to be used as a means of exchange for our digital and physical products & events — it may “save you money” that you would otherwise have to pay to acquire these assets.

Claiming $BRIX

Every building has a unique, randomized code that can only be claimed once per period — this prevents double-claiming on an NFT and keeps the tokenomics intact. The $BRIX you can claim depend on your holdings. Every holder regardless of the amount they may own is entitled to $BRIX if they register their holdings for a given period. The period is always a month.

Escaping to the Belgian coast: Suite 133,"Upon the Belgian coast is Knokke-Heist, where visitors swoon to for a fleeting escape. Charming seaside properties are aplenty. And under this category, there’s Suite 133, an apartment stay brought to you by local resident and arbiter of taste, Linda Dossin.

For as long as she can remember, Linda has been passionate about interiors and remodelling old buildings. It ultimately led her to create Escape the Ordinary, a family-run hospitality group, which became a way for Linda to share her proclivity for design with others.

Currently, Escape the Ordinary oversees two premium apartments in Belgium, including Suite 133 that’s ideal for weekenders. Here, the motto is simple: stay, enjoy and inspire. And inside bright and airy interiors, it’s entirely easy to drift from the humdrum of daily life.

I had the chance to speak to the wonderful Linda to find out more about Suite 133 and her enthusiasm for slow living.

You used to run a manor in the Ardennes. What was the story there?

As a young family, we would often escape to the Ardennes on the weekends. The area is fondly referred to as Belgium’s green lungs, and when you visit, you can see why. Nature takes centre stage; it’s so beautiful, making it the perfect place to slow down and relax.

We found a sizeable house here, and since it had more than enough room for the four of us, we thought of sharing it with others. And so Entre Ciel et Terre, which translates to ‘between sky and earth’, was born. It was a luxury bed and breakfast, which we ran for several years.

What was that transition like to Knokke?

As my children grew up and left, it became difficult to maintain the B&B by myself, as my husband worked elsewhere. As a result, we looked towards Knokke, a seaside town in northern Belgium, about a half an hour drive from Bruges. People call Knokke the Monaco of the North, sans the Mediterranean sun. Besides the casino, Knokke has always been a hub for those in the creative fields, and you’ll find plenty of galleries, exhibitions and museums. There’s also the Zoute Grand Prix, an annual art and lifestyle festival featuring luxury cars.

It simply felt like the best place to start our next chapter.

How did you choose a property in Knokke?

To continue offering our hospitality services, I envisioned a getaway that encompassed the luxury of a hotel but with the facilities and convenience of a small apartment. As such, it wouldn’t just be a standard hotel room.

We found the property, but it needed many renovations, which took longer than anticipated. By the time everything was done, it had brought us up to the end of January 2020. But soon after, the Covid-19 pandemic took full force, so we had to close for several months.

Where do you source your decor, and how do you decide what pieces to implement for the interiors?

I’m always on the hunt for tasteful objects. My children tease me, as I can never resist spending copious time inside antique shops or markets.

For Suite 133, I prioritised finding items that inspired mindfulness through simplicity. I like a more minimal style, and where the place is light-filled, I naturally gravitate towards raw, earthy materials and colours.

What do you hope your guests takeaway after a stay at Suite 133?

I always say that when you stay with us, you’re not merely booking a room. You’re booking a lifestyle. I consider Suite 133 as more than just a physical space because I want it to provoke a calm feeling where the guest experience is concerned.

Our goal is to foster the art of slow living, eliciting comfort and contentment. I hope our guests feel like they have managed to rest, create memories, and appreciate the beauty that lies in a muted, understated surrounding.

What are your favourite things to do in Knokke, and what are some points of interest that you would recommend to guests?

Knokke is a natural beauty, and I enjoy taking in the scenes, going on walks and hikes. Since it’s not too far away, many people cycle from here to the historic centre of Bruges, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It’s a great way to get outdoors and be active. For more sporty activities, there’s also the Royal Zoute Golf Club.

The town draws in many international artists, architects, sculptors and painters, and so the nearby galleries are a joy to visit as they hold exciting exhibitions throughout the year.

Indeed, you’ll find plenty of luxe restaurants and high-end shops. And as mentioned earlier, a casino for anyone looking to try their luck.

Although international travel has been unsteady, where do your guests mainly come from?

Many of our guests are here for staycations, coming from all parts of Belgium. Recently, we also have had a lot of visitors from the Netherlands, Germany, Luxemburg, England and Russia.

What can we expect from your brand in the coming months?

As a family-owned hospitality group, we try to offer a unique, personable hospitality experience through all our endeavours. We are constantly searching for exciting projects, but I consider ourselves a work-in-progress. I would say: stay tuned…",https://medium.com/@lescalejournal/escaping-to-the-belgian-coast-suite-133-f07d3269cea9,"[""L'Escale Journal""]",2022-01-09 18:36:52.900000+00:00,"['Travel', 'Knokke', 'Review', 'Belgium', 'Hotels']"

For most of us, a Zatra means a temple festival when the Hindu devotees take darshan (paying obeisance) of the temple deity on that auspicious day, participate in the Rath (chariot) pulling ceremony or Palkhi (palanquin) ceremony of the deity. Besides this, the Zatra is also comprised of a feiri (village fair) in the temple premises with some stalls selling the tasty khaje (local sweet made from gram flour and sugarcane jaggery) and other stalls selling useful items and home appliances. But, recently I got to know, that in some specific village temples, for certain Hindu communities a Zatra is much more than what we all seem to know and there are many customs and traditions attached to the celebration.

Trupti Tari dressed in a kapod ( nine-yard saree) in the traditional style

On the 4th of December 2021, on my visit to our family friends Mr Tukaram Tari and his wife Trupti in Vasco, I saw Trupti dressed in a nine-yard saree, a kapod (cotton/ silk saree) in the age-old traditional way which is known as kashin nessop (the saree is draped like a dhoti). She had donned a fulanchi atti / fanthi (flowers plaited together) in her hair and was clad in jewellery. On asking Trupti the reason for being dressed up this way, I got to know from her about the Volvoi Zatra of Devi Gajant Laxmi (local village Goddess) and the various customs observed there. Volvoi is the ancestral village of Mr Tari and both of them had just arrived home after attending the Zatra of their Gram Devi (ancestral village Goddess). This Zatra was held on that very auspicious day of Kartiki Amavasya (the new moon night of the month of Kartika of the Hindu Shakya calendar). Mr Tukaram Tari told me that, on this Zatra day all the villagers of Volvoi not only take darshan (pay obeisance) of the Goddess Gajant Laxmi, but also pay a visit and respect to the local deities in the other temples of Goddess Sateri, Kulpurush Deol (temple of the ancestral head of each family) and Rampurush Deol (temple of the village Saviour).

The quaint village of Volvoi is close to the banks of the River Mandovi in Ponda taluka and about thirteen kilometres away from the main town of Ponda. Interesting folklore about this village is that it was created from separate regions of land which were getting flooded with the river water. These separate low lying regions were connected together by the building of bundhs (dams). This is locally known as vholl /vollh ghalop. Thus the village got the name Volvoi. Years later these bundhs developed khavte (cracks) and once again the village started getting flooded with water. At that time one of the Purvaj (ancestor) from the village approached a close relative in the neighbouring village of Betki for his advice to stop this problem. The said relative asked the Purvaj to offer human life as an offering/sacrifice (which was a practice of a traditional custom in that era) to the bundh to put a stop to the khavte (cracks). A local young lad was offered as a sacrifice to save the village and the problem is supposed to have got solved. Since then, this young Saviour of the village whose name was Ram began to be worshipped by the villagers. They built a small temple named Rampurush Deol (temple) in his memory close to the banks of the River Mandovi. During any of the religious festivals and on the day of the Volvoi Zatra, all the villagers pay their respect to this Rampurush as a form of gratitude.

The original natives of Volvoi belong to the Tari (boatmen) community. This Tari (boatmen) community, owned small boats and carried the trade of transporting logs of timber and other commodities and even people in their boats along the River Mandovi river to distant places. They would transport the commodities to places like Khandepar, Chodnem located on the river banks as well as to the various towns in the coastal areas in Goa which included Panaji and Vasco. Sometimes, two boats were tied together to form a sangodd in order to ferry more logs in a single trip. During the Portuguese regime (Goa was liberated from this regime in 1961) in Goa, a Tari Sociedad (society) was formed in Volvoi to carry out this business of timber transportation as it was the main source of income to the villagers.

Tukaram Tari narrated to me that it is believed that initially, only four main families of the Tari community resided in Volvoi. The heads of these four Tari families are the Kulpurush (main ancestors). These ancestral heads came to be known as Vhodlo (eldest one), Mhodlo (middle one), Dhaklo (youngest one) and the Bhandari Kulpurush. Four mini temples in the village have been dedicated to these Kulpurush. Tukaram Tari and his family members are the descendants of the Bhandari Kul and hence they pay obeisance in the temple of the Bhandari Kulpurush on various religious occasions which also includes the Volvoi Zatra.

[Note: This Bhandari Kulpurush is different from the Bhandari Samaj which is another special community amongst the Hindus in Goa.]

Just like most of the villages in Goa, Volvoi has a local ancient temple dedicated to Goddess Sateri. Sater means a roin (an anthill) which was worshipped by the early Goan ancestors and later on came to be known as Shantadurga in some places. It is this Goddess Sateri of Volvoi who gave shelter in her own vatar (area) to Goddess Gajant Laxmi who came to this village from some other distant land. The Goddess Gajant Laxmi is known by this name as the idol of Laxmi Devi is flanked by Gajas (elephants), one each on either side who are seen with raised trunks showering water on her.

There are different folklore about the arrival of the Goddess Gajant Laxmi to this riverside village of Volvoi. Some folks believe that the original idol of this Goddess was found in one of the boats of a Tari, who came back to the village after delivering the timber to a neighbouring place. The villagers believed the idol to be of Goddess Kelbai and that she had come on her own to settle down in Volvoi. After noticing that the idol was not of Kelbai but was of Goddess Gajant Laxmi they built a temple for her in the village. Whereas Tukaram Tari has a different tale that has been narrated to him by his ancestors. According to his tale, Devi Gajant Laxmi was originally from a place named Unchgao in Kolhapur and is supposed to have been brought to Goa from that place. Initially, she was kept in a place named Rumad in Ponda taluka and later on brought to Volvoi. A temple was built for her by the Tari community of this village. The existing temple of the Goddess Gajant Laxmi is about 126 years old and since it was built by the Tari community, they are the Mahajans (owners) of it. Since then the Murthy Punarprathishthapan (ceremony of replacement of the idol of the Goddess) has been performed thrice. The last time this ceremony was performed was in May 1995 when the temple had completed a century.

About a couple of years ago the existing original temple has been extended and a new Sabha Mandap (a meeting hall) and a grand entrance have been added to accommodate more people during the temple festivities. Also, the Kalash (dome) of the temple has been renovated.

Every year to honour and thank the Goddess Gajant Laxmi for having brought prosperity to the village on her arrival, the villagers of Volvoi celebrate the temple Zatra on the auspicious day of Kartiki Amavasya (full moon night in the month of Kartika). On this day, the Palkhi (palanquin) ceremony of the Goddess starts at seven-thirty in the morning. First, the aarti (religious ritual of worship) and the other rituals of the Goddess are performed and she is seated in the Palkhi which is carried by the Mahajans belonging to the Tari community. The Palkhi is taken out for paying respect to the other ancient temples located in the vicinity. This procession is accompanied by the Bhatt (temple priest), a Vajantri (band of local musical instruments) and hundreds of Savashins (married women) carrying a fully lit divaj. A divaj is a two-layered traditional tree lamp made from brass which used to be made from clay in the olden days.

[Note: Divaj is Goa’s official state symbol].

A brass divaj ( traditional two-layered tree lamp) with a handle for holding

For participating in the ritual of Divaja at the Zatra, all the Savashins (married women) are dressed in a kapad (a nine-yard saree) in the traditional kashin style. They are decked in gold jewellery and adorn their hair with a fulanchi fanthi (weaved flowers). Each of them comes with a divaj in the hand and oil to light it. This divaj is lit by a Mahajan and given to the Savashin. The Savashin first goes with the lighted divaj to her respective family Kulpurush (ancestor) temple to pay respect to him and comes back to join in the procession of the Palkhi going to the Sateri temple. On the way, all of them halt to pay respect at a Gram Purush (village ancestral head) temple. Then the Palkhi procession proceeds to the temple of Goddess Sateri to pay respect to her as a mark of gratitude for having given shelter to the Devi Gajant Laxmi. Near this temple, the newly married women join in the procession along with their husbands. These newlyweds are initiated by the Bhatt for the first time in the ritual of Divaja. Then the entire procession returns back to the temple of Gajant Laxmi where the Palkhi is kept in the temple hall for the rest of the devotees to pay obeisance while the Mahajans light the lamps on the Deepasthambha (tower for lamps) outside the temple. Each of the Savashins performs the aarti of the Goddess holding the divaj and takes five Pradakshina (circumvent) around the temple. After the Pradakshinas all of them go to pay their respect to the Rampurush temple which is located close to the banks of the river. They pluck small twigs of the Paripat (a small wild medicinal herb) shrubs growing there and adorn them in the hair as a symbolic token of completion of the annual Divaja ritual. After this, they all disburse to have their meals as they had been fasting and then indulge in some shopping in the mini feiri (fair) which is held in the area around temple premises.

Trupti Tari, who always attends the annual Zatra, says that all the Savashins have to observe an Upvas (a fast) right from the previous day (eve of Amavasya) in order to perform the ritual of Divjaa. They break the Upvas and have a proper meal only after the completion of the Divaja at the Zatra. Further, she explained the interesting initiation process of the newly married Savashin into this ritual of Divaja for whom it starts from the first Zatra soon after marriage. In the first year of marriage, the Savashin participates in the Divaja along with her husband and the couple is called Ghatval. The Ghatval couple joins the Palkhi procession at the Sateri temple only after the Bhatt performs some special initiation rituals and lights the divaj for them. The couple together holds the divaj and joins the Palkhi procession returning back to the temple of Gajant Laxmi where the husband moves out of the procession while the wife joins the rest of the Savashins in completing the Pradakshina and other rituals of Divaja. Subsequently, from the next year of marriage, the Savashin participates alone (not with the husband like the previous year) in the Divaja of the Zatra along with the other women.

This ritual of Divaja is performed by Savashins belonging to other Hindu communities too at some other temple Zatras across Goa celebrated on other auspicious days. The village temples of Amona, Alorna and Khandepar celebrate their annual Zatra with Divaja on the same day as the Volvoi Zatra. Trupti mentioned to me that all over Goa, twelve places including Volvoi celebrate their annual Zatra on this auspicious day of Kartiki Amavasya and it is known as the day of Bara Zatra(twelve Zatras).

On the night of the Volvoi Zatra, a Kalo festival is held near the Gajant Laxmi temple. The young men from the village along with the seniors participate in this Kalo, wherein a special stage is erected in the temple premises for conducting the same. At this stage, a scene known as Ganesh Vandana depicting Lord Ganesh with his two consorts Riddhi and Siddhi is enacted. This act is followed by the performance of a teen anki Pouranik Natak (a three-act play based on the Puranas which are the ancient scriptures of the Hindu religion). The entire village comes to see this Natak as it is a source of learning the Puranas and entertainment. The dramatists of Volvoi are well known far and wide for being good at performing on stage. Master Dattaram Walwaiker who belongs to the Tari community of Volvoi was well acclaimed in the theatre world in Mumbai. He was known for performing and directing plays in the Marathi language. Another dramatist named Narhari Volvoikar whose grandfather was a Tari from Volvoi also started his acting career over here before gaining fame far and wide. So one can conclude that the performance at the Natak (drama) in the Kalo at the Volvoi Zatra is a launchpad for the local dramatists to hone their acting skills.

Besides having the honour of carrying the Palkhi of Devi Gajant Laxmi in the Volvoi Zatra, the men belonging to the Tari community in Volvoi enjoy the same honour in the Zatra of Devi Vijaya Durga at Keri, a village in the neighbourhood of Volvoi. A young and cheerful relative of mine named Geet Gaurish Naik, whose maternal Kuldevi (ancestral Goddess) is Vijay Durga in Keri, informed me about this Zatra held on the auspicious day of Dashmi, Shukla Paksha of Margashirsha month (tenth day of the waxing moon of the Margashirsha). On this day the Tari community from Volvoi has been bestowed the special honour of carrying the Palkhi of Devi Vijaya Durga and all of them are served special food by the temple priest himself. This respect is given to them as a form of gratitude for having done the favour of ferrying the Goddess Vijay Durga to Keri village in ancient times. This year, the Keri Zatra was celebrated on the 13th of December 2021.

After the celebration of the Zatra of Gajant Laxmi this year, the entire family of Tukaram Tari and all the descendants of the Bhandari Kulpurush got the opportunity to celebrate the Nutan Murthi Pratisthapana Sohala (function of installation of new idol) of the Bhandari Kulpurush. This was held on the 25th and the 26th of December 2020 and comprised of a grand function of performing the religious rituals and worshipping of the new idol.

Trupti and Tukaram Tari told me that December was a month of total enjoyment for them as they participated in the festivities of Volvoi Zatra as well as the function of the Bhandari Kulpurush temple. Now they are looking forward to the unique Volvoi Gondall which will be held in the month of March. Meanwhile, for the rest of the Goan Hindus, the Zatra season will continue as they celebrate the forthcoming Zatras of their own Kul devatas (family Gods) and Gram devatas (village Gods).",https://medium.com/@larapereiranaik/village-of-volvoi-the-temples-the-zatra-and-the-festivities-around-f956056e07ba,['Lara Pereira Naik'],2022-01-24 06:02:55.629000+00:00,"['Zatra', 'Tari Commuunity', 'Goa', 'Festivals', 'Volvoi']"
Stay in Touch with your Sales on the go with RT GSync,"All businesses rely heavily on the performance of their sales department. There are dedicated resources allocated to making sure the process of sales is not hindered in any way. Companies go above and beyond to make sure that their sales figures do not drop, and that their clients become repeat customers.

One of the ways the digital revolution has manifested itself in this environment is through CRM, or Customer Relationship Management software, which is a sales automation tool designed to help sales teams as well as the executive members in determining the status of their operations. It provides a birds eye view of all sales operations from opportunities to leads to actual sales made.The way this is accomplished is with the help of different modules such as contacts, documents and calendar, which all contribute to a sale one way or another.

The rapid growth of mobile communication has on the one hand given a boost to the number of ways that a business can conduct sales, but at the same time, the reconciliation of mobile activities with the CRM environment has emerged as a hurdle in keeping business streamlined, and making sure all data is available in one place.

Google’s services have made it possible for data to be synced across mobile devices, but third party applications like CRMs need special plug-ins to take advantage of these capabilities in their own environments.

You can use your Google account to sync contact information and Calendar events to the CRM.

RT GSync is a module designed to integrate Google’s core services with Sugar and Suite CRM. Just like you have access to Google contacts, calendar and drive documents anywhere you can sign in with your Google account, GSync takes it a step further and allows you to link it with your CRM instance.

Sales On the Go

It doesn’t matter if you are making connections, or creating opportunities outside of the workspace, you can use your Google account to sync contact information and Calendar events complete with all the different attributes (email addresses, notes, reminders etc.) to the CRM. You can even add a document to your drive, and it will appear in your CRM for future reference.

It works both ways. Consider that you have arranged a meeting with a lead on the CRM calendar, and sometime later you need to add some notes to that meeting for reference. Simply tap into your mobile Google Calendar app, and make the addition to the event that has been synced from your CRM. You can work from anywhere if need be. Similarly, if you meet a potential client while out of office, and you want to add them to your CRM contacts list, you can do so on your mobile.

Keep Your Backups Organized

What makes CRMs so great is the organization of records. Be it contacts, accounts, leads, opportunities or documents, you have the option to associate one with the other, meaning you have every related item close by when you are looking through any record.

RT GSync aims to keep this organizational aspect when backing up and syncing documents to your Google Drive. It creates folders in your drive named after each module. When you associate a document with a record in that module, it creates a subfolder within that folder which creates the document. This way you never lose track of which documents are related to which modules.

Getting RT GSync

If all the features mentioned above pique your interest, and you think you could enhance your business’s CRM experience by merging it with Google services, you will be happy to know that GSync is compatible with both Sugar and Suite CRM.

HOW TO CONVERT MORE LEADS WITH SALES CALLS,"Assisting businesses with lead conversion is one of the most frequent requests we receive. In today’s digital world, converting leads is one of the most important milestones in the sales process. Changes in digital marketing strategies, competition and technology have made it important to make sales calls efficiently in order to build a lasting relationship with your customers.

A successful sales call is often the first step in building a lasting relationship with a prospective client.

Let’s take a look at how you can convert more leads by planning your sales calls more carefully.

Organize your agenda

You can only hold the customer’s attention for a limited time -make it count. Set up some basic talking points and keep the conversation organized and relevant. Don’t be afraid to get to the point!

Know your audience

It’s important to know your prospects before you talk to them in order to market your brand successfully. Databeys’ sales CRM helps you learn about your audience at the click of a button. Use every key knowledge you can get and use it to sustain your customer relationships.

Make room for the client

We get it, time is short and you have to pitch your services, but making the call and starting a monologue is the kind of interaction that’s not going to get you a customer. Ask your prospect what they’re looking for and then pitch your product accordingly. Let the customer steer the conversion!

HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH CRM,"The quality of customer service you provide affects the customer experience and ultimately your brand. Poor customer service can lead the customers to believe that the brand is lazy and doesn’t care about them. So how exactly can you improve your customer experience? That’s where CRM comes into play.

CRM provides a technological foundation for great customer service

Here are a few ways you can get your salespeople to fall in love with CRM

Real time data sharing across teams

When customers have to repeat their problems to every support person, they can get annoyed and give up on your product. CRM systems eliminate this problem by giving customer data and history access to the entire team no matter which platform the customer came from, making the customer service process seamless and efficient.

Knowledge Management

CRM systems provide knowledge management portals that enable customer self-service. Customers can access the FAQ and troubleshooting articles and solve basic problems without needing to talk to a representative. CRM systems also help set up online forums where customers can interact with each other and ask questions. Convenient, isn’t it?

Consistent Customer Experience

Getting feedback from customers is also a form of customer service, one where you show them you care about their experience!

CRM allows you to automate surveys and schedule follow ups to gather customer feedback about how you can improve your service for them.

This can ultimately result in the failure of a business and financial loss. You don’t want that to happen to your business, do you?

In order to fall in love with it, they need to understand it. Ultimately, you’re their boss. Help them understand what exactly CRM does and how it will be beneficial to them and not only to the business.

Provide Training

Once you have educated your salespeople about the importance of CRM, teach them how to use it. Arrange workshops or monthly training sessions to get them familiarized with software so they can start using it and save both your and their time.

Offer Incentives

Get the best out of CRM with Google Integration,"Google services have increasingly become an essential part of everyday lives, be it for business or personal use. Multiple Google services such as Drive cloud storage, and synchronization of contacts and calendars across different platforms serve a key function in streamlining business activities.

Sync CRM and Google Services with GSync

CRM is a great sales automation tool used by businesses worldwide for simplification and visualization of their sales pipeline. It offers some useful features for daily sales activities, but one of the shortcomings for CRM platforms such as SugarCRM and SuiteCRM is their inability to streamline data across platforms.

Companies wanting to transfer data from a different platform will have to put in a significant amount of careful effort in simply populating their CRM with their previous data.

Each document is synced to its specific record’s folder on Drive, thus keeping the organizational aspect of Sugar intact.

With the help of RT GSync, this problem is taken care of. Companies who use Google services for streamlined functionality across platforms and devices can rest easy using CRMs, because RT GSync not only syncs your contacts and calendar from your Google account, it also syncs documents to and from your Drive, meaning you have access to all your material on the CRM platform. It seems like a no-brainer to have Google sync with CRM because in this mobile world, you can add contacts and useful notes on the go, and then have access to them when working on CRM.

Sync Calendars

It is important for any business to stay on top of the meetings and events that are scheduled with customers or leads, or otherwise. The calendars on Sugar as well as Suite are well designed to achieve the basic functionality of monitoring and creating events and schedules. RT GSync takes it up a notch by syncing the CRM calendar with your Google calendar which means you can stay updated on all events on the go via your mobile. You don’t have to work exclusively on the CRM, you can arrange a meeting at any time, and it will show up in the CRM when you log in.

Sync Contacts

Contacts are the most important asset of any sales team. Both Sugar and Suite provide a robust Contacts module that caters to your needs of storing all the vital information about a business contact be it an existing customer or a new lead. With RT GSync, not only are you able to sync contacts from CRM to Google, but any contacts you add on Google, will also sync directly to the CRM. You don’t have to worry about making sure your contacts are up to date between your phone and the CRM, because GSync is doing that for you.

Sync Documents

Documents serve an important purpose in the CRM system. Any kind of document, be it a contract, a proposal, or a report, can be stored alongside a contact to keep everything organized. With RT GSync, you can rest assured that each and every document that you upload to the CRM will be backed up to your Google Drive, ensuring that important data is not lost. One other neat feature is that each document is synced to its specific record’s folder on Drive, thus keeping the organizational aspect of Sugar intact.

Why Are You Not Closing Enough Leads Despite Using SugarCRM?,"Your business may have a CRM put in place in order to visualise all aspects of the sales process, but what matters is how much you get out of it. If you are still not closing enough leads, you may need to look at the way you use CRM.

CRMs are all about pipelining the sales but SugarCRM’s default views and configurations struggle to provide helpful insights that prompt actual action; meaning oftentimes we end up using it merely as a contact directory. Looking at the list view of any module, say leads, you can’t figure out if a salesperson is overworked or if less valued opportunities are being given priority over the bigger ones. This is bound to happen when we don’t know what is being worked on in our sales department. The conventional layouts and useless reports in the default edition of CRM are to blame for all this.

Introducing Kanban Boards

Imagine a board with lanes, such that each lane represents a unique lead stage such as new, assigned, and in process. Now imagine a sticky note with a task written on it that you put in the lane representing the stage the task is in. That’s the idea of Kanban boards. With a Kanban board it is not only easy to see where everything is, but easy to shift it around so it is organized for maximum positive outcome. If any of the stages are clogged, you risk dropping the sales. With this insight, you now have the action-able information that can be used to avoid drop in sales. Simply divide the work better so every salesperson has enough to focus on without being overworked.

Break down your leads into columns with RT SugarBoards

Kanban gives a bird’s eye view of your sales pipeline. According to AllBusiness.com, ”Kanban Can Help Take the Stress Out of Sales”. Trello, which is based entirely on this concept, was acquired in 2017 for $425 million.

How do we use it in SugarCRM?

If you want your sales team to be more productive, close more leads, and drop fewer sales going forward, it’s a good idea to give Kanban boards on CRM a shot. For SugarCRM instances, RT SugarBoards offers what you need as a simple CRM plugin. It can convert every module of SugarCRM into boards like the one described above based on different criteria, which can be configured intuitively as per your preference.

SugarBoards offers more than just a categorized tile view of modules. It lets you perform actions from within the Kanban view, such as making a phone call, writing an email, or making notes and setting up a future meeting with a potential sale, all within a few clicks. It also allows you to see the details of the record, the existing status of a lead or sale and much more, without having to switch to and from each individual record’s detail view.

How SugarBoards can Help in Closing More Leads and Improving Business

Look at it this way, when you use Kanban boards instead of the default list view, you get more done in less time. By simply providing you more options on the main view, and by enabling simple drag and drop changes for assigning opportunities or qualifying a lead, whereby you can move a record in the pipeline much more quickly than you could without Kanban, Sugarboards allows your business to give more time to focus on each lead without being bogged down by the procedural issues of updating fields in CRM. All the technical details are taken care of, and the sales manager can focus on managing resources to get the best outcome for the company.

Important CRM Questions To Ask Before Buying It | MYNPEC,"CRM’s are an integral part of running a successful business, as it helps you connect with your current and prospective clients more effectively than ever before. They can improve marketing, sales, and customer service. But before you invest, there are some important questions to ask.

What is CRM?

CRM software has gone beyond the traditional boundaries of sales to create deeper customer relationships.

Now, it is used to collect data from every interaction with your customers and turn that information into insights to provide better service than ever before.

Common CRM questions to consider before buying:

1.Is My Company Ready for CRM?

The decision to invest in a CRM should be made carefully. Company culture and technological skill levels are important considerations when choosing a CRM system. These factors will affect not only how employees perceive your company’s direction but also their productivity.

2.What is the difference between ERP and CRM?

ERP and CRM software can be very similar, as they both help your business become more efficient. However, each type has its unique approach to managing company data; this makes them different.

Marketing, sales, and customer service teams can use CRM software to manage customer relationships.

The goal is for more transactions at higher volumes of sales productively to generate leads or make purchases from your prospects regularly, which would then turn into long-term clients you’re billing monthly subscriptions.

The goal of ERP software is to make business operations more efficient and reduce costs. It’s typically used by finance, inventory, and procurement professionals who want a tool to help them with their day-to-day work.

What is Data Structure in CRM?

The world today is tech-driven. It is important to be very familiar with the concept of data structures.

A coder would likely give you a much more detailed definition. Still, from my perspective, your business relationships translate into the software.

Sometimes there are too many things to keep track. For example, insurance agencies have a thousand different relationships with their customers, managing all those details will be overwhelming.

A commercial account is just one example in an agency’s portfolio; they also need personal line clients and underwriters who may not even work at the same company, how do you get them organized? It seems impossible sometimes.

But luckily for these firms, we’ve got CRMs that will take care of everything automatically, so your staff doesn’t miss anything important or forget any offers available out on the market today.

Grouping your data in a CRM is not as difficult or overwhelming once you know what to look for.

This article will give some idea about how best to group the different pieces of information and then provide an example structure that insurance agencies can use with commonalities between them.

Organize the contact details of each person.

Linking contacts to the respective organization

Tagging appropriate organization

For personal lines, implement a contact tagging structure (home, auto, life, etc.)

Configure Sales Pipelines and begin tracking opportunities

Implementing CRM can be daunting, but it is important to stay organized before starting.

What are the required CRM features?

There are innumerable CRM solutions in the market, each promising more advanced features than their competitors.

Although a jaw-dropping feature set can be invaluable to your company’s success in modern business trends-don’t overlook what you need the most.

The following is a list of the necessary CRM features that any company should have:

Contact, opportunity, and account management

Record linking tasks with reminders for each project or client in progress (to ensure completion)

Multi-user log-ins so you can manage your business’s online workspace as one centralized place through permissions settings like access rights between employees etc.,

Sales team member tracking- Who was working on what? What was their deadline?? There will never be any more confusion about who did this task when they return to duty after a break

Pipeline customization reporting gives real-time insights into how many customers are waiting at different points along our workflow process

It’s important to compare all plan levels when looking for a hosting company. Some may restrict features such as backup or provide limited bandwidth, which could make them inadequate in the long run and potentially cost you more money down the line with maintenance fees than necessary.

How to Import Existing Data in CRM?

The manual data entry process is time-consuming and tedious. With the right human resources, most companies will never put forth this effort to do it themselves, which means you may overlook something.

Most systems have a variety of import settings that will allow users easy access and flexibility when connecting with their contacts management system or CSV files; though before diving into this process, fully remember — try loading small samples first.

Make sure to tag your data in case of a CSV import. This is because if you don’t, then hours’ worth of labor will be spent on categorizing later down the road, and this time could’ve been saved by doing it during stage one.

What is your required Integration in CRM?

Third-party integrations offer a great way for business requirements with diverse needs to connect their software platforms.

Initially, it might not seem to be such an advantage; most companies will find that these Add-ons provide more value as they continue integrating other applications and tools into the mix.

The importance of a CRM cannot be overstated. It will serve as the “hub” for managing customer data and sales information and has other uses in some cases like project management or monitoring social media trends among employees.

By implementing this system correctly with automatic feedings from your team’s activities into it-you’ll find significant efficiencies are achievable.

List of the best features to have in your CRM:

You can synchronize all email conversations into contact record histories

Importing quotes and proposals onto opportunity records

It integrates seamlessly with external document management sources

Sending new leads to your bulk email marketing systems

Mirroring tasks and events to smartphone calendars

Who Needs Access?

In addition to the benefits of accessibility, migrating your company’s sales information into a cloud service will also allow you more efficiency.

The main advantage is that users can simultaneously access important information from any web-enabled device.

The increased accessibility of your CRM means that you need to make decisions about who will access it, what privileges they have in the system, and whether assigning new leads.

An important feature to consider when looking into CRM plans is how much you’re spending per user. With a set number allocated for each employee, your costs will never increase unless you opt for more features.

Finally, it would be best to look at these questions from a data security perspective. Not all employees need administrative privileges to view sales records, and some companies restrict access only for those who have specific needs. Doing so can reduce risks associated with unwanted incidents.

What is the cost of a CRM?

Cloud-based customer relationship management solutions can cost a lot of money, especially when you factor in the monthly subscription fee.

Some vendors provide higher-priced packages with more features for those who sign up early versus what’s offered on lower-level plans; this could quickly add up.

The free CRM tools allow you to get a good idea of what they are capable of, but if your business has more than 100 employees or $500K in annual revenue, paid versions will work better.

Business owners should assess the TCO for CRM solutions and consider costs such as:

Total monthly or yearly subscription costs

One-time CRM implementation expenses

Data migration costs

Onboarding and training expenses

Customization and integration fees

Ongoing customer support charges

Volume discounts or fee reductions for annual payments

Make sure that you have all your queries covered before making a decision. There are many CRM features and benefits to consider, so take time for research that will let you get the most out of each CRM platform with its various layouts — be it form-based or dashboard driven; easy integration options into existing systems like email campaigns (and more); limitless opportunities in terms of customization.

With instant access to real-time insights, you’ll have less work on your hands than before because you can automate critical processes like qualifying leads or closing deals for increased customer retention rates.

What are the reasons to use a cloud-based CRM system?

Cloud-based CRM is an excellent way for companies of all sizes to grow their businesses. Here are seven reasons or benefits of cloud-based CRM on why you should consider it.

1. Work From Anywhere or Anytime

A cloud-based CRM is a system that can be accessed on any device, around the clock. This capability makes it easier than ever for teams across different departments to get the information they need in any device like a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop, or a desktop and ultimately improve business process efficiency by allowing staff members from anywhere in an organization access to their respective databases at all hours of day or night.

The cloud-based CRM provides seamless mobile access to the centralized database that you can use for making sales calls, amending proposals, or finding prospects’ phone numbers.

2. Hassle-free Installation

Image Source: Freepik

In the world of CRM, you’ve heard the phrase “a long process” and complex installations. That was true in past years, but now it’s not! With cloud-based systems and quick installation times, getting your company on board with an efficient customer relationship management strategy is easy as pie.

All you ever need is a steady internet connection for Cloud-based CRM installation. Once signed in, plenty of software and capabilities are available to make the most out of it.

You can very well easily access it from anywhere or anytime with an internet connection and never have to worry about setting up hardware or paying for maintenance on servers since that all gets taken care of by a cloud-based CRM provider .

3. Flexible

Image Source: Adobe Stock

CRM is a vast and comprehensive system that can help your business communicate more efficiently. A cloud-based CRM offers the ability to tailor it specifically for you while also giving businesses of all sizes multiple options when the small companies need something new or improved in their platform — like adding extra features on-demand without having any downtime whatsoever.

A cloud-based CRM is a perfect fit for any business. Not only does it offer instant updates to satisfy new needs, but employees can also do what they need when with this system as long as it has 24×7 access.

4. Cost-effectiveness

It’s easy to analyze why many people would be hesitant about investing in a CRM system. The upfront cost can seem overwhelming, and there are so many options out on the market today that it is hard for small businesses like startups without much resources at their disposal to choose one wisely.

However, cloud-based solutions (which offer pay-as-you-go subscriptions) become less of an issue because these types operate with minimal initial investments, making them more affordable than ever before.

5. Effortless Integration

The multitude of software and hardware that make up a CRM can often be cumbersome, especially in businesses where information exchange between different applications is prevalent.

A cloud-based CRM software provides flexible options for companies who need more help with their sales process than traditional stand-alone products.

This compatibility, specifically in its ability to integrate across multiple platforms and devices like Gmail and Office 365 products, including Excel, Word, and PowerPoint.

This makes the Cloud an even better choice for your business. This enables you to carry out tasks seamlessly from the start through the finish without any difficulties.

6. Enhanced Security

Cloud solutions are more cost-effective and much safer than traditional data center solutions. Companies that offer cloud-based CRM software take security concerns seriously with advanced automated backup policies and robust recovery plans to ensure the safety of your information no matter what happens in case there’s an attack on their system.

You can improve upon these already impressive levels by using two-step authentication or stronger passwords and being completely GDPR compliant using cloud-based CRM software.

7. Great Reliability

What happens if the power goes out? In this situation, you would have no access to your customer data or information. That means all of that hard work is going up in smoke.

Not only could there be a significant halt with productivity but even worse — some essential details about their products and services might disappear forever due to an offline CRM system model, which has been known as on-premise software.

With a cloud-based CRM system, you can get your customer data through the cloud, restore it onto a computer or smartphone and go back to work without worrying about losing any vital information.

That kind of reliability is not just convenient but necessary in this day and age where cyberattacks are constant threats that we must always be aware of.

Ending Note

A cloud-based customer relationship management system will help you provide excellent service by centralizing your customer database and automating key processes.

You’ll be able to access real-time updates, which give an end-user a comprehensive view of their interactions with customers all from one system.

Cloud-based CRMs provide several benefits that make them attractive for many businesses. They’re easy to install, offer seamless online access with low setup costs and no special equipment required; they also happen cost-effectively as well as securely!

Make Better Use of Suite CRM with Kanban Boards,"Your organisation may utilise CRM for day to day sales activities, and the visualisation of the sales pipeline is of great benefit to the sales team. The question then becomes, how do you get the most out of the CRM software, and is there a way to improve its visualisation benefits to further increase its value to your team?

Take SuiteCRM, a popular open source CRM solution which is used all over the world. It provides all the benefits of conventional CRM software, but its views do not provide ample context for the sales pipeline stages that could prompt actual action.

Take the example of a module, say leads. A list view is good for letting you know how many leads are being pursued, but in a quick glance it is not easy to determine how many new leads have been generated, and how many in comparison have been progressed.

Kanban Boards

This is where the idea of Kanban boards comes in. Imagine a board with lanes, such that each lane represents a unique lead stage such as new, assigned, and in process. Now imagine a sticky note with a task written on it that you put in the lane representing the stage the task is in. That’s the idea of Kanban. With a Kanban board it is not only easy to see where everything is, but easy to shift it around so it is organized for maximum positive outcome. When looking at your sales in Kanban view, it is easy to see where the heavy load is. If any of the stages has more cards than others, you know that you risk dropping sales because work could be stalled. With this insight available instantly, you can spread the tasks for a smoother operation of your sales.

Kanban gives a bird’s eye view of your sales pipeline. According to AllBusiness.com, ”Kanban Can Help Take the Stress Out of Sales”. Trello, which is based entirely on this concept, was acquired in 2017 for $425 million.

When you use Kanban boards instead of the default list view, you get more done in less time.

How Kanban boards improve CRM

If you want to improve sales operations, and increase productivity of your team, Kanban in CRM is the way to go. With a bird’s eye view of the whole process, including which item is in which stage, and how many items are in each stage, it is far easier to make sure that sales are not stalled at any stage.

In addition, Kanban for CRM makes it easy to shift the items around. With a simple drag and drop, you can qualify a lead, progress a sale along the pipeline, and even mark a sale as complete or incomplete.

RT Dynamic Boards

RT Dynamic Boards is a Kanban plugin for Suite that enables the Kanban view for your modules so that you can reap the benefits of Kanban inside SuiteCRM.

But Dynamic Boards doesn’t limit itself to simplifying the sales progress along the pipeline. On the Kanban cards, you are provided with shortcuts to calls, emails, and notes, so all actions for the card are within a few clicks. Each card also shows other relevant information for the item, so for instance a lead has the source displayed in colour coordinated tags. This saves you the hassle of switching back and forth from list view to detail view for each and every item.

Why Dynamic Boards?

When you use Kanban boards instead of the default list view, you get more done in less time. By simply providing you more options on the main view, and by enabling simple drag and drop changes for assigning opportunities or qualifying a lead, whereby you can move a record in the pipeline much more quickly than you could without Kanban, Dynamic boards allows your business to give more time to focus on each lead without being bogged down by the procedural issues of updating fields in CRM.

Get RT Dynamic Boards for SuiteCRM

If you are using SuiteCRM in your business, simply get the RT Dynamic Boards plugin here, or contact support@rolustech.com if you want to know more.",https://medium.com/@pt_rolustech/make-better-use-of-crm-with-kanban-boards-6388bf5edf3f,['Plugin Team'],2022-01-14 11:33:28.793000+00:00,"['Crm Solution', 'CRM', 'Suitecrm Plugins', 'Suitecrm', 'Kanban Board']"
‘Too much sugar’ is surely a thing…,"Photo by Mikhail Nilov from Pexels

Sugar is a simple carbohydrate that your body uses for energy and is also considered the source of all health evils. But how much of it is harmful is the real question. According to many health organizations and medical experts, the amount of sugar intake has been the biggest public health concern.

Signs that tell you that you are eating too much sugar

Increased hunger and weight gain:

Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has been linked to weight gain. Also consuming sugar makes you want to eat more sugar.

Irritability:

Eating too much sugar can be the reason if you’re feeling moody or irritable.

Low energy and fatigue:

Sugar is something that can be easily absorbed and digested and that might be the reason you are feeling fatigued. It is also a very quick energy source but no matter how much you eat, after 30 minutes you are going to be hungry again and will feel low.

Cravings for sweets:

The feel-good effect of sugar on your brain might be the reason you are craving sweets all the time.

High blood pressure:

Scientists say that high levels of glucose can damage the lining of your blood vessels which makes it easier for lipids like cholesterol to stick to the walls of blood vessels. This hardens the blood vessels causing your blood pressure to shoot.

Acne and wrinkles:

Research shows that advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are products of excess sugar, encourage skin aging.

Sleep issues:

The sleep cycles and quality of sleep are regulated by the light and the temperature of the room, as well as glycemic control. So a diet with high sugar can cause long-term sleep issues.

Joint pain:

Consuming too much sugar might lead to systemic inflammation, which might ultimately lead to joint pain.

Why is sugar present in almost all foods?

The reasons why sugar is present in almost all foods are given below:

Adding sugar to foods makes them more appealing

Sugar is added because of its preservative abilities

It serves as a bulking agent in ice creams and baked goods

It balances the acidity level of foods containing vinegar and tomatoes

It fuels fermentation

It gives baked goods flavor, texture, and color

Nutrition labels and sugar

The threshold for the products being high or low in sugar is given below:

High: more than 22.5 total sugar/100g of serving

Low: 5g or less total sugar/100g of serving

Why are added sugars a problem?

As it provides extra calories and provides very little nutritional value. Eating too much sugar might lead to multiple health problems.

Weight gain: Added sugar adds to the problem of weight gain as it is extremely calorie-dense. Poor nutrition: If you are choosing sugar-laden foods instead of nutritious foods then you might miss out on important nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Tooth decay: Sugar promotes tooth decay as the bacteria multiplies and grows. You are more likely to get cavities if you drink or eat more foods with added sugar.

Some of the different names of added sugar

Cane syrup Malt Maple syrup Molasses Honey

Conclusion:

Sugars, though are considered a source of energy, can have negative effects if their consumption exceeds a certain point. So it’s really important to look out for the sugar content in your meals and diet. If the amount is too high, it is paramount you control its intake.",https://blog.arisoapp.com/how-much-do-you-really-need-to-worry-about-sugar-7b263b82147e,['Naurin Ansari'],2022-01-27 08:15:26.388000+00:00,"['Health', 'Sugar Free', 'Diabetes', 'Nutrition', 'Sugar']"
ProtoType One,"ProType One Design Concept

I’m on this endeavour to help people with type one diabetes run successful marathons and even help them complete the Ironman triathlon.

How is that possible? It’s a Loonshot worth nurturing I believe and I’ve learned insights that one couldn’t find in a textbook yet.

It is because, on this journey I decided it’s time to reach out to pioneering experts like Havlik Marcell, the CEO of Diabtrend.

Diabtrend is an AI based diabetes diary application. Why is that a BIG Deal?

Let me give you some context.

To this day, I keep a record of my blood glucose measurements in a physical notebook designed for the purpose to track my blood glucose and insulin dosages.

The notebook is not so precise, it is rather based on habitual timings with measurements slots for three regularly occurring meals like “values before and after breakfast”

The doctors recommendation is to check before and within 90 minutes after the meals. But what if you have snacks in between meals? And what if you excercise?

A picture of my oldschool diabetes diary

There is always two kinds of data one can collect: qualitative and quantitative data. Diabtrend is setting a standard for medical best practice by allowing you to collect both.

The app uses a training period of two days to set trends for your glucose levels and learns more and more overtime when you use their gamified point collecting system that helps in the blood glucose prediction system they have.

In addition to this there is food and voice recognition built in to the app.

I was amazed when I first saw this technology!

That’s when I realised, perhaps it’s time to show them my first prototype.

I’m focused on pairing caloric output to the changes in blood glucose.

The aim is to be able to predict the change in plasma glucose based on the caloric performance of the athlete.

For this I developed an experimental formula and I was hoping to get some feedback from the team behind Diabtrend.

What I learned was that maybe it’s time for me to start thinking about self learning algorithms and great news : My equation could serve as a basis for one!

Marcell introduced me to a computer language I haven’t heard before. It’s called Julia.

Then he recommended I check out this TED talk with Alan Edelman, the co-inventor of the programing language.

Edelman says:

“A good programing language design is applied psychology…

It not only allows computer units to talk to computers, but it allows humans to talk to humans about their intent on the computer.”

Moreover, there are four objectives he specifies:

It creates community

enables talk between humans and machines

creates software collaboration

Benefits everyone from high performance

And thanks to the world wide web I get to part of the community of seekers who think about self learning algorithms, but there is a challenge.

For security reasons the continuous glucose monitoring sensors use an encoded data transfer method that doesn’t allow third parties to use the data.

It’s a good thing that strangers can’t hack my blood glucose readings, but the thing is… I can’t experiment with it either.

This brings us to the topic of designing experiments and one of my favourite Nobel Laureates, William D. Philips.

In year of 2019 in Lindau he said in an interview view with Adam Smith :

“I think it’s clear that there is a French approach to doing science that is different from an American approach to doing science, at least among the French scientists that I know.

Now, of course, people say these days “The World is Flat” meaning that that things tend to even out across the world and perhaps the differences are not as great as they once were.

But I appreciate those differences very much, because the way I see the difference, what we might call the classic exaggerated version of the difference between the French approach and the American approach is that the French would think of a problem first.

They would calculate everything that they could about that problem, figure out exactly what should happen, and then go into the lab and see that that they had calculated whereas the Americans would think of a problem and say, wonder if I could do that in the lab, then go into a lab and see what happens.”

For now it seems I’ll have to choose the French route and continue the progress that way until I become certified to develop my solutions.

It’s an interesting journey and I’m happy to be up for the ride.

Innovations in Continuous Glucose Monitoring for diabetics,"Continuous Glucose Monitoring Device. For a long time to diabetics, fingerprick tests were a regular affair when it came to monitoring their blood sugar levels. However, a recent generation of devices called Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) have risen to give accurate blood sugar readings in almost real time.

Some of these gadgets can be connected to a smartphone or smartwatch and display readings remotely. Most CGM devices are equipped with audible alarms that set off when the blood sugar level spikes or drops too suddenly.

For use with smart devices — Dexcom G6

The Dexcom G6 is one CGM more popular with those who love smart technology. By sending automatic updates (every 5 minutes) to a connected smartphone (both iPhones and Android), tablet or computer, it excels at smooth close monitoring. Particularly for those times when glucose levels may drop dangerously low, causing one to lose consciousness.

Known to be highly accurate, the gadget monitors interstitial fluid to gauge the level of blood sugar level. The sensor is wearable on the belly or arm.

Great value — Abbott FreeStyle Libre

A really simple device, the Abbott FreeStyle Libre serves its CGM functions well, making for easy reading and great value. One drawback is that it needs the phone to be scanned over the device itself to get a reading. The good thing is that there is no limit to the number of scans allowed.

Additionally, it is designed to be placed on the back of the arm only. If constantly scanning the device is not a problem for you then this gadget will likely prove to be a worthy choice.

Long term use — Senseonics Eversense

The Senseonics Eversense requires a physician to insert the device underneath your skin and activate it. You cannot replace or activate it on your own. Do take note of this important peculiarity.

However, it only needs to be replaced every 90 days, making it ideal for long term use. Combined with its low-maintenance, the Eversense model is good for those who just need a basic CGM and do not mind it being inserted under the skin.

Diabetes Vaccine: Immunotherapy (PIpepTolDC) shot for Type 1 Diabetes,"Research Spotlight

When speaking about vaccination, usually the end goal is to prevent the disease from happening. But have you ever thought of vaccination as a treatment for an auto-immune disease?

Well, the PepTolDC immunotherapy vaccine (a treatment that uses a person’s immune system) is designed just to fit that!

With more than 1.25 billion people worldwide affected by diabetes and 246 million children under the age of 20 affected, this immunotherapy vaccine seeks to not only help patients with type 1 diabetes but also to prevent type 1 diabetes, or T1D before it even starts.

Phase I trials (taking place at the City of Hope Medical Center — California) are investigating the side effects of the PIpepTolDC vaccine in treating patients with type 1 diabetes who use insulin and don’t have any other diabetes-related health complications.

Given that Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, the PIpepTolDC vaccine helps the immune system to stop attacking the beta cells of the pancreas, which may help the beta cells recover and make enough insulin to control blood sugar levels.

The idea of solving the core problem of auto-immune disease is a dream coming true! Better yet, it may have implications for other auto-immune diseases as well.

How does this treatment work?

To understand how this treatment works, it is critical to understand Type I Diabetes first.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. This means that the human immune system, which usually protects against foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses, attacks the body’s insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas marking an autoimmune response. Over time, the beta cells are destroyed by the immune system.

As you can imagine, the standard treatment for people with type I diabetes would be insulin intake. But this can be expensive, chaotic, and often ineffective at maintaining a normal lifestyle.

Here’s the good part: PIpepTolDC vaccine works like an allergy shot. The vaccine is made using one’s immune cells (dendritic cells) and a beta-cell protein. It appears to put an end to the body’s attack on the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. The vaccine aims as well to reactivate immune tolerance mechanisms that are poised to begin repairing beta-cell damage and restoring their ability to secrete sufficient levels of insulin in response to blood glucose levels.

This would be a very important advance in T1D treatment and may even help to reduce future type 1 diabetes-related complications!

How can I get involved?

While this study is still in the first phase of human trials, it has the great promise to have a life-changing impact on people with diabetes and autoimmune disorders across the world. Participants are likely to be paid in addition to having access to the most up-to-date potential treatments and contributing to essential research. Studies like this one can redefine diabetes treatment in the future. If you’re one of the 1.6 million people living with type-1 diabetes in the US, this exciting treatment and potential cure could be available to you.

The trial is currently recruiting around 7 volunteers, all of whom must have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. Participants also are required to have the historical presence of at least one type-1 diabetes-associated autoantibody and must meet over 30 other criteria as well. It may be confusing at first to understand whether you qualify for this research study. Luckily, MyDiabetesResearch can help you understand which research studies you qualify for! The search tool can even show you the best-fit research studies based on your preferences and medical profile!

Diabetic Retinopathy : A complete review,"Image credits : Canva

What is Diabetic Retinopathy, and how does it affect you?

Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retinal tissues ( retina). Uncontrolled blood sugar is a risk factor. Diabetic retinopathy may cause no symptoms or just minor vision abnormalities at first. However, it has the potential to cause blindness.

Anyone with type 1 or type 2 diabetes can develop the illness. The longer you have diabetes and the less tightly you control your blood sugar, the more likely you are to have this eye problem.

What signs and symptoms of diabetic retinopathy are there?

There are no symptoms of diabetic retinopathy in the early stages; however, as the condition progresses, you may develop:

Spots or dark strings may appear in your vision.

Vision is blurry.

The vision that shifts.

There are dark or empty spots in your vision.

Loss of vision

What types of diabetic retinopathy exist?

Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR)-

The most common form of the disease referred to as ‘Nonproliferative Diabetic Retinopathy,’ is the early stage of DR in which there is no abnormal growth of blood vessels (proliferation).

NPDR causes the walls of your retinal blood vessels to weaken. This causes ‘microaneurysms’ to protrude from the walls of the smaller blood vessels, sometimes causing fluid and blood leakage into the retina.

It also causes dilation of larger retinal vessels, causing them to dilate beyond their normal diameter. NPDR progresses from mild to severe as more blood vessels become blocked. This can also cause swelling in the retina’s micro nerve fibers, causing the macula (the central-most region of the retina) to swell.

Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) -

As the severity of diabetic retinopathy worsens, it can progress to this advanced stage known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The earlier damaged blood vessels have closed off by this stage, stimulating the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels within the retina, which are most likely to leak blood and fluid into the clear, jelly-like substance that fills the central area of your eye (vitreous).

This abnormal growth of blood vessels within the retina stimulates the growth of scar tissue, which may eventually lead to the retina’s detachment from the back of the eye. There is also a chance that the new blood vessels will obstruct the normal flow of eye fluid, resulting in increased pressure in the eyeball. This can also cause damage to the optic nerve, the central nerve that connects your eye to your brain, leading to glaucoma.

What other complications might diabetic retinopathy bring about?

Diabetic retinopathy, if left untreated, can lead to a variety of other serious eye problems, including:

1)Diabetic macular edema (DME) — DME is a type of macular edema caused by diabetes. DME occurs when blood vessels in the retina bleed fluid into the macula, resulting in blurred vision.

2) Glaucoma with neovascularization -

Diabetic retinopathy can cause aberrant blood vessels to grow out of the retina, obstructing the drainage of fluid from the eye. This leads to a specific type of glaucoma (a group of eye diseases that can cause vision loss and blindness).

3) Retinal detachment

Retinal detachment is a condition in which the retina becomes detached from the rest of the body. Scars in the back of your eye might develop as a result of diabetic retinopathy. Tractional retinal detachment occurs when scars pull your retina out from the back of your eye.

Who is more likely to get diabetic retinopathy?

Diabetic retinopathy can affect anyone with any kind of diabetes, including type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as well as persons who are pregnant.

The longer you have diabetes, the greater your risk of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy affects more than half of all diabetics over time. However, by regulating your blood sugar levels, you can reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.

Women who have diabetes and get pregnant, or who acquire gestational diabetes, are at significant risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.

If you have diabetes and are pregnant, you should get a thorough dilated eye exam as soon as possible. Consult your doctor if you require an additional eye examination during your pregnancy.

What factors contribute to diabetic retinopathy?

Diabetes can cause cataracts, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy, which is defined as damage to the retinal vessels of the eye. If not treated, these damaged vessels can cause poor blood flow (ischemia), inflammation, and, eventually, contractual blindness.

How is diabetic retinopathy diagnosed?

Diabetic retinopathy can be detected during a routine eye examination by an ophthalmologist.

Visual acuity: The ability to see is referred to as acuity

Intraocular pressure: Intraocular pressure to rule out glaucoma.

Eye muscle function: Muscle function in the eyes refers to your ability to move your eyes.

Peripheral vision: Peripheral vision is what you see when you look out the sides of your eyes.

Pupil response: This test examines your pupils’ reactions to light.

Your eye doctor will then administer eye drops. Your pupils dilate (widen) as a result of the drops .

During this examination, the doctor looks for:

Blood vessels that are not normal.

You have a bleed in the center of your eye.

New blood vessel formation.

Swelling of the retina

What can I do to reduce my chances of developing DR?

Long-term blood glucose control aids in the prevention of diabetic retinopathy and reduces the risk of getting it.

Taking the following actions can reduce your risk of getting diabetic retinopathy:

Trying not to smoke.

Keeping your blood sugar under control is essential.

Regularly exercising.

Getting your eyes checked on a regular basis.

Maintaining a healthy blood pressure.

Following all prescription instructions to the letter.

What is the DR treatment?

Your eye doctor will generally only keep track of how your eyes are going in the early stages of DR. As a result, diabetic retinopathy patients may require a full dilated eye exam every 2 to 4 months.

It is critical to begin therapy as soon as possible in the later stages, especially if you notice alterations in your vision; treatment can prevent your eyesight from worsening. It’s also critical to take efforts to manage your diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol.

Managing Your Lifestyle: One of the most effective methods to combat any health issue, including DR, is to improve your entire lifestyle. This will keep your eye’s blood vessels healthy and efficient, which will help you control your blood pressure and blood sugar levels and prevent vision loss. Improving your dietary intake is also an important aspect of DR-resistance lifestyle management.

Diabetes Insipidus causes & diagnosis (DI),"Diabetes Insipidus (DI) is a rare disorder with a reported prevalence of 1 in 25,000 people in the general population. In this disorder, there is an imbalance of fluids in the body and the kidneys pass an abnormally large volume of urine which is colourless and odourless.

In this article, we are going to discuss in detail diabetes insipidus causes & diagnosis.

Did you know that Insipidus comes from the word ‘insipid’, meaning weak or tasteless?

In most people, the kidneys pass about 1–2 litres of urine a day but in people with DI, the kidney can pass about 3 to 19 litres of urine a day in severe cases. As a result, the person may feel extreme thirst even if he/she has something to drink.

Adults have a higher chance of developing the condition but it can occur at any age. In rare cases, diabetes insipidus diagnosis can occur during pregnancy also, known as gestational diabetes insipidus.

Now, you must keep reading the blog to know more about the condition, its diagnosis, causes, treatment and how it differs from Diabetes Mellitus. In order to understand Diabetes Insipidus, first, let us learn about the role of kidneys and normal fluid regulation in your body.

Role of kidneys and normal fluid regulation

The kidneys play a very important role in fluid balance.

Kidneys are bean-shaped organs about the size of a fist located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. To produce 1–2 litres of urine, the kidneys normally filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood composed of waste and extra liquids.

In overall body mass, fluids can make up as much as 60% and maintaining the proper amount of fluids in the body is key for overall health management. While urination removes most of the fluid from the body, breathing and sweating also help to remove fluid from your body.

A system of organs and hormone signals are used by your body to normally regulate the fluids. The kidneys play a very important role in fluid balance and regulation by removing extra fluid from the bloodstream.

The fluid levels are regulated in the body either by producing less urine when there is a need to replace fluid lost to sweating or making more urine when there is too much fluid in your body. Your brain (hypothalamus) regulates the feeling of thirst and the need to drink water.

What is Diabetes Insipidus (DI) and how is it different from Diabetes Mellitus (DM)?

Diabetes insipidus diagnosis happens when either the secretion or response to the pituitary hormone ‘vasopressin”, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is impaired. It results in the production of very large amounts of dilute urine which is colourless and odourless often leading to dehydration and increased thirst.

In most cases of DI, there isn’t enough antidiuretic hormone (ADH) production or the kidneys are not responding properly to ADH. Excessive production of urine can result in dangerous dehydration if a person does not increase the water intake.

Another question that might come to your mind: Are Diabetes Insipidus and Diabetes Mellitus related?

The answer is Diabetes Insipidus and Diabetes Mellitus (both type 1 and type 2) are unrelated, although both conditions might have similar symptoms like frequent urination and constant thirst. Here is the difference:

In Diabetes Mellitus, high sugar levels lead to the production of large volumes of urine to help remove excess sugar from the body.

In Diabetes Insipidus, increased urination is due to disturbance in the water balance system of the body.

Of the two conditions, diabetes mellitus is more harmful and harder to manage. Let us now take a look at the different types of Diabetes Insipidus.

If you’re looking for diabetes treatment and management, you can enrol in our program where you will be under the guidance of experts. Visit Zyla.in or download the Zyla app now.

What are Diabetes Insipidus causes and types?

The brain produces an antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin which is stored in the pituitary gland after production. When the body needs to retain water, the pituitary gland releases vasopressin into the bloodstream.

But what causes DI? When there is a need to remove water from the body, the hormone is either released in very small amounts or not released at all, leading to urination more often.

Diabetes Insipidus causes include a disruption in hormone production or when any part of the regulation system breaks down. If a person has diabetes insipidus, the body can’t properly balance fluid levels.

There are 4 types of diabetes insipidus and each type of Diabetes Insipidus causes are unique. Types include:

1. Central Diabetes Insipidus

When there is some damage to a person’s hypothalamus or pituitary gland, it causes disruption in the normal production, storage and release of vasopressin leading to central diabetes insipidus. This causes the kidney to remove large amounts of fluid from the body which leads to increased urination.

There can be various reasons which can result in damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland:

Surgery in the area of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus

Infection

Any inflammation

A tumour in or near the pituitary gland

Head injury

Loss of blood supply to the pituitary gland

An inherited defect in the gene that produces vasopressin

In some cases, the cause might be unknown.

Damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland can cause Central Diabetes Insipidus.

2. Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus

In Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus, the response of the kidneys to vasopressin is affected. The kidneys are unable to properly respond to vasopressin due to a defect in the structures of the kidneys. Like central DI, nephrogenic DI is very rare.

The defect may be due to:

In inherited (genetic) nephrogenic DI, the condition results in the kidneys either completely or partially not responding to vasopressin.

In the acquired form of nephrogenic DI, the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine when water needs to be conserved is also reduced.

Acquired/secondary nephrogenic DI can have various causes, including:

Kidney cysts that may develop due to other conditions such as polycystic kidney disease

Kidney infection

High levels of calcium in the bloodstream

Some cancers

Certain medications, especially lithium or tetracycline

Low potassium levels in the body

Blockage in the urinary tract

3. Dipsogenic Diabetes Insipidus

Dipsogenic diabetes insipidus cause is a defect in the thirst mechanism and is not related to ADH (vasopressin). It occurs when the mechanism that makes you feel thirsty is damaged and you might feel thirsty even when fluid isn’t needed.

It can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus. The same reasons which might lead to central DI can lead to dipsogenic diabetes insipidus.

It can also be caused due to:

Certain medication

Mental illnesses or mental health problems

4. Gestational Diabetes Insipidus

Gestational Diabetes Insipidus occurs only during the pregnancy period and most pregnant women who develop Gestational DI have a mild case that does not lead to noticeable symptoms. It usually goes away once the mother delivers the baby, however, it can occur again if the mother becomes pregnant again.

In a few cases, it occurs due to an enzyme released by the placenta that degrades vasopressin while in other cases, pregnant women produce more prostaglandin, a hormone-like chemical that reduces the kidney sensitivity to vasopressin.

Now let us take a look at how your healthcare provider will help in Diabetes Insipidus diagnosis.

Diabetes Insipidus Diagnosis

How do you know if you have diabetes insipidus? Your healthcare provider can diagnose it based on the following:

1. Medical and family history

Your healthcare provider can diagnose diabetes insipidus by taking medical and family history, asking to review the symptoms and whether any member in the family has a history of diabetes insipidus or its symptoms.

2. Physical examination

By physical examination, the healthcare provider can diagnose diabetes insipidus by examining the skin, appearance and checking for the signs of dehydration.

3. Urinalysis

A urinalysis test is done to see whether the urine is dilute or concentrated. It also helps in distinguishing between diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus if there is the presence of glucose in urine.

The doctor may also ask you to collect urine in a special container over a period of 24 hours to measure the total amount of urine produced by the kidneys for diagnosis.

4. Blood test

A blood test is done to determine the sodium levels in the body which can help diagnose diabetes insipidus and in certain cases help understand the type of DI also.

5. Water deprivation test

Water or fluid deprivation test is a reliable test to help in diabetes insipidus diagnosis. The test has to be performed by a specialist under proper supervision. Your healthcare provider may perform two types of water deprivation tests -

a. Short form of deprivation test

In this test, the patient is instructed to stop drinking all liquids or fluids for a specific period of time, usually during dinner. The next morning, the patient is asked to collect the urine sample at home. A urine sample is given to the lab to measure the concentration of the urine.

b. Formal water deprivation test

This test is performed at the hospital to continuously monitor the patient to check for the signs of dehydration. It involves allowing the patient to become increasingly dehydrated while taking blood and urine samples.

Samples taken during the test are analysed to determine the concentration of urine and blood and measure the levels of electrolytes, especially sodium in the body. Close supervision is done to rule out psychogenic polydipsia, a condition that causes a person to drink large volumes of water habitually.

Under normal conditions, dehydration triggers the secretion of vasopressin leading the kidneys to conserve water and concentrate the urine while in diabetes insipidus, either insufficient vasopressin is released or the kidneys are resistant to the hormone. Testing these dysfunctions will help diagnose and define the type of diabetes insipidus.

6. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

MRIs cannot diagnose diabetes insipidus but will help in checking if there is any problem in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland of the patient. It will also help the health care provider to determine if diabetes insipidus is the possible cause of the patient’s symptoms.

Symptoms of Diabetes Insipidus

Your body’s primary responses to dehydration are thirst to increase the water intake and decrease urine output for conserving water loss in the body. This will lead urine to become concentrated and dark yellow in colour.

In adults, symptoms of Diabetes Insipidus include:

Severe thirst

Passing more than 3 litres of urine a day (polyuria)

Waking up a lot during the night to go for urination

Peeing during sleep (bed-wetting)

Pale, colourless urine with a low measured concentration of urine

Weakness

Muscle pains

Crankiness and dehydration

Bed-wetting is one of the symptoms of Diabetes Insipidus.

In infants and children, symptoms of Diabetes Insipidus include:

In infants, you need to watch out for:

Crankiness

Slow growth

Poor feeding

Weight loss

Fever

Vomiting

Infants with hereditary nephrogenic DI may not eat properly and fail to gain weight with slow growth. They may also be irritable experiencing fever, diarrhoea and vomiting causing recurrent episodes of dehydration which leads to slow growth and delayed development in infants.

Diabetes Insipidus diagnosis must be done on time and should be well-managed, as over time it can damage the bladder and kidneys leading to pain, infections and kidney failure. With proper treatment, it can be managed with very few complications and lead to a normal lifespan.

In children, signs include:

Drinking a lot of water

Peeing often, sometimes every hour

New bed-wetting or starting to wake up during the night frequently to pee

Dehydration

Low energy

Diabetes Insipidus complications

If Diabetes Insipidus isn’t under control or managed properly, it can make you more likely to have these Diabetes Insipidus complications:

1. Dehydration

The major complication of Diabetes Insipidus is dehydration i.e. if water loss is more than the intake. As the level of water loss increases, more symptoms of dehydration can become visible.

You might notice the below symptoms with dehydration:

Extreme thirst

Fatigue

Dizziness

Confusion

Nausea

Loss of consciousness

Dry skin

Sluggishness

Did you know? Severe dehydration can lead to seizures, permanent brain damage and even death. Seek immediate care if there are any symptoms of severe dehydration such as confusion, dizziness or sluggishness. You can prevent dehydration by increasing your water intake throughout the day.

2. Electrolyte imbalance

Electrolytes are minerals in the body with an electric charge. They are present in blood, urine, tissues and other body fluids. When the amount of water changes in your body, the level of electrolytes can become too low or too high.

In Diabetes Insipidus when you lose too much water, your electrolyte levels can go up or low which might cause:

A headache

Feeling tired all the time or fatigue

Irritability

Muscle pain

3. Disturbed sleep

Diabetes Insipidus can lead to nocturia, a condition in which you wake up at night due to frequent urination resulting in a disturbed sleep or a less restful night.

Without medical treatment, other possible complications of Diabetes Insipidus may include:

Low body temperature

Accelerated heart rate

Weight loss and frequent headaches

Low blood pressure (hypotension)

Kidney or brain damage

Diabetes Insipidus treatment

The Diabetes Insipidus treatment primarily is to prevent dehydration by drinking enough fluids. Your health care provider may refer you to a nephrologist for treating kidney problems or an endocrinologist for treating disorders of the hormones.

As Diabetes Insipidus types have different causes, similarly treatment for extreme thirst or frequent urination depends on the type of Diabetes Insipidus.

1. Central Diabetes Insipidus

To treat central DI, a synthetic or man-made hormone called desmopressin in form of injection, nasal spray or pill is given which works by replacing the vasopressin that the body naturally produces and decreases urination.

It helps in managing the symptoms of central DI, however, it does not cure the disease.

2. Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus

In nephrogenic DI, since kidneys don’t respond to ADH properly, giving desmopressin won’t help in managing the symptoms. Instead, your doctor may advise a low-salt diet to decrease urine production by the kidneys and increase water intake to prevent dehydration.

Medications for nephrogenic DI include a class of diuretics called thiazides, either given alone or in combination with aspirin or ibuprofen.

Diuretics are commonly prescribed to help patients’ kidneys remove fluid from the body. Instead in nephrogenic DI, diuretics are given to reduce urine production and concentrate urine.

3. Dipsogenic Diabetes Insipidus

No effective dipsogenic Diabetes Insipidus treatment guidelines is yet found by the researchers.

It is advised to try sucking on ice chips or sour candies to keep the mouth moistened and increase the saliva flow, which may help in reducing the desire to drink water.

Taking a small dose of desmopressin at bedtime may help the patients who wake frequently at night to urinate. Your healthcare provider initially may monitor the blood sodium levels to prevent low sodium levels (hyponatremia) in the body.

4. Gestational Diabetes Insipidus

The doctors prescribe desmopressin for pregnant women with gestational diabetes insipidus as the placenta does not destroy desmopressin, unlike vasopressin. After delivery, most of the women will not need any treatment.

Most people with Diabetes Insipidus can prevent serious complications and live a normal life by following the doctor’s advice and recommendations to keep their symptoms under control.

After delivery, most of the women will not need any treatment for Gestational Diabetes Insipidus.

Lifestyle modifications and dietary changes

Lifestyle modifications play an important role in managing the symptoms of Diabetes Insipidus. The most important part is to prevent dehydration. You can carry a water bottle wherever you go or offer your child to drink water every few hours if they have DI. Your doctor will help you determine your daily fluid intake.

You can carry a medical alert card in your wallet so that others can know about your condition in case of emergency as dehydration can happen quickly and at any time.

Your doctor may advise you to have a low-salt diet and refer to a nutritionist for making a customized diet plan. Reducing caffeine and avoiding processed foods from the diet as these are high in salt can be effective steps to control water retention and consume foods with high water content such as melons.

Diabetes Insipidus is often difficult or impossible to cure as it results either from genetic problems or due to other conditions. However, symptoms can be managed effectively if Diabetes Insipidus diagnosis and treatment is done properly. While it is a lifelong condition, with ongoing treatment, the outlook can be good.

Remember to always have something to drink close by as you will be more prone to dehydration especially if the weather is too hot or when you exercise. Carry your medication with you and avoid situations where you can’t get water.

Why an accountant holds CTSI,"Why an accountant holds CTSI

When an accountant holds CTSI, it’s time for an interview. Accountants do finance reports, budgets, tax returns, and accounting records. They provide their clients with financial reports that feature present and prospective trends in their financial situation and they have the reputation of being risk-averse. So, I asked him: what is the main reason for an accountant to hold CTSI?

Joe Tang / @joecwtang is a Dutch chartered accountant, specializing in crypto. He started his career in a large and traditional accountancy office, before joining KPMG where he first heard about blockchain and how it potentially could make accounting more efficient. Flashforward to today, Joe is now the co-founder of NEO, a small accountancy firm that offers accountancy, fiscal advice, payroll accounting, and consulting. His business is going so well he’s not taking any new clients at the moment.

I asked Joe when he started venturing into the crypto space, finding he began his journey in 2017 — at the time only wanting to see if blockchain tech could increase efficiency in accounting. In the Netherlands, companies took a hard hit during the 2008 financial crisis and it was not until 2017 that things started to turn upwards. Joe: “During this time, companies were unwilling to invest in making their accounting more efficient through innovation — they were still recovering from the crisis.”

It was only recently that Joe began holding crypto of his own. Asking how he determines which projects to support, Joe replies, “When it comes to crypto, I never participate in meme coins or dump projects. There must be a strong product or community behind it.” If there isn’t? Joe shakes his head, then he simply isn’t interested. When he first heard about Cartesi, he thought: Linux with blockchain? Cool. “For me, Linux was the trigger to dive deep into researching Cartesi, CTSI, and getting to know the community supporting the project”.

“Connecting to Linux is potentially big: 99% of all our devices are (in)directly running on Linux. I realized what the future power of Cartesi is.” @joecwtang

From what he found, Joe is optimistic about Cartesi’s future, “winning Linux devs over to blockchain won’t happen overnight but I’m doing it for the long term.” Currently, Joe’s staking in a pool with Noether’s Delegated Staking to help secure the network and earn rewards on his CTSI. Having only recently launched staking on Mainnet at the time of this interview, it was great to hear him getting involved in staking CTSI with us.

He doesn’t use his CTSI for payment: “I didn’t realize you can pay with CTSI until I heard of Travala accepting CTSI. But I do prefer payments with fiat money because that loses value.”

In the Netherlands, lessons have been learned from the financial crisis and monetary policies are well-arranged, with built-in buffers overseeing the borrowing of money. But for Joe, it’s just another way to continue to print money. Global monetary policy, how money is being printed and inflation rates are subjects Joe thinks the government needs to take action against. Asking him for some final words to share with our community, or anyone who might be interested in venturing into crypto, Joe has this to say:

“I never give investment advice, but I do share sometimes my experience. I say to customers who keep their money in the bank: do something with your money, anything is better than a savings account.” @joecwtang

3 Features of ADHD-Friendly Organizational Systems,"What works for an ADHD brain often isn’t the same as what works for everyone else. If you have ADHD and try to follow common advice about staying organized, you might get frustrated.

Instead, below are 3 tips that I’ve found to be especially helpful for ADHD. You can use these 3 features to make effective systems that help you stay on track toward your goals.

1. Visual Cues

Out of sight, out of mind. . . if I don’t see something, it’s unlikely I will think to do it. Creating an environment that visually prompts me to do things helps me follow through on commitments. Trying a new planner or an app that won’t be seen, and perhaps even avoided if it’s not easy and fun enough, isn’t likely to help me. Instead, there are many visual cues that can already naturally fit into daily life — colorful post-its, whiteboard calendars, keys by the door. Instead of relying on ignorable tools or your mind to remember things, consider setting up the current environment with visual reminders.

This post-it reminds me to bring my lunch in the fridge to work.

2. Social Commitments

Often, it can be easier to do things for others than for ourselves. When I’ve told someone else what I plan to do, I’m more likely to follow through. As the deadline looms, I feel the internal pressure to be true to my word. For example, let’s say I have a task to do. If I put it on my calendar, it may or may not happen — especially if it’s not fun and there’s no real accountability to finish it on certain timeline. However, if I schedule a meeting with my coach, I’m much more likely to work on my stated goals before the meeting. Similarly, if I have a project at work I could preemptively schedule a meeting with my colleague for the end of the week, which will motivate me to make progress more than if I had just put my own arbitrary deadline.

I schedule social commitments in my Google calendar.

3. Natural Consequences

I like to think that I’ll do things for myself that feel good, like keep an exercise routine or see friends. But when it comes down to it, my favorite thing to do is . . . nothing. Mmm. Positive rewards hardly work — “Go exercise, you’ll be healthy! Go exercise, it will feel good!” Instead, I’ve found it more motivating to avoid pain. Pain, in this case, can be either a social consequence or a direct consequence. For example, if I notice the gas in my car is empty, I won’t procrastinate: I am going to fill it up before I go home because I don’t want to be stranded and I don’t want to be late to my next appointment. As another example, if I’m going to the coffee shop to work, I might not bring my laptop charger. That way, I’ll have a natural time limit, and I’ll feel motivated to use my limited battery life efficiently on the work I intend to complete. Often it’s extreme realities and actual consequences that motivate behavior change. If there’s no real consequence, then I’ll follow my inspiration in the moment and the task may or may not get done.",https://medium.com/@walkwithchristina/3-features-of-adhd-friendly-organizational-systems-381fbc53b353,['Christina Coravos'],2022-01-18 23:59:20.343000+00:00,"['Cleaning', 'Adhd', 'Getting Things Done', 'Organization']"
Easy-to-follow move-out cleaning checklist,"Easy-to-follow move-out cleaning checklist

Before you start, remove all personal belongings. We recommend you pack up as much as possible before starting the clean-up. This allows you to dust off surfaces more easily, and also makes it easier to clean your old books and other effects scattered in the cabinets all together.

Save this one for last as dust and chemicals will have likely fallen while cleaning elsewhere. Remind your roommates not to walk on the floor until it is completely dry, and keep pets in another room. If you have a house or townhouse rental, pay attention to the landscaping (don’t forget about your children’s toys, cigarette butts, patio furniture, etc.), garage (often neglected because it’s not an indoor space, but ends up getting dirty as it’s often used for storage along with mess caused by vehicles, children or pets) and laundry room (if you have a washer and dryer in your unit, you’ll want to make sure any lint or detergent spills are removed).

Make a difference with smell! A place that smells good will immediately make any guest, including your landlord, feel comfortable. It also gives them the assurance that your home has been well maintained or at least given a good scrub very recently.

Things you need to do in every room:

Clear cobwebs from ceiling.

Clean closet exteriors and interiors.

Dust light fixtures, fan blades, window blinds, HVAC vents, and don’t forget the corners of rooms. Use the brush attachment on your vacuum to remove any dust lingering on your baseboards or trim, and wipe them down.

Sweep & vacuum floors, carpets, windowsills and screens, and then mop. For carpets, remove them by applying commercial carpet cleaner and letting it sit for a few minutes. Use a microfiber cloth to blot the stain away. Some common carpet stains require a specific solution for removing, so be sure to use the right product for your apartment carpet cleaning.

Use a window or glass cleaner to wash your windows. Simply spray the solution onto the window and wipe quickly with a lint-free cloth to avoid streaks (here’s a pro tip: use a newspaper if you don’t have a lint-free cloth). Make sure to dust off the handles, locks, and between the sliding tracks if your windows have them.

If you have stains on your walls, grab a microfiber cloth and wash the walls using an appropriate cleaner for the paint finish.

Remove nails, pins, and tacks from walls. Based on the size of holes in your walls, you may be asked to restore them by filling in and painting over them. This is a must do after you take out your wall-mounted TV! Use commercial putty and paint in the same color as your wall (sometimes your landlord will provide this) to restore it to its original state. Be sure to use a putty knife to properly apply the product.

Check lights and wipe light switches. Your lease may require you to replace any light bulbs that may have gone out.

And don’t forget to empty the garbage!

Kitchen Tasks:

Clean countertops, backsplashes and kitchen appliances, beneath, inside and out. Wipe down the microwave and the insides of the fridge and freezer, removing any remaining food still in there.

Move your stove. You’d be surprised to find out how much food has been rotting between your stove and cabinets! Give the stove top a good scrub and wipe. Remove burned-on food from your burners with readily available kits like Weiman Glass Cook Top Cleaning Kit. Don’t forget to clean the oven. Most modern ovens have a self-clean mode so give that a round or two.

It may seem unintuitive, but the dishwasher will also need a clean. Use a sanitizing wipe to rid your dishwasher’s door of any soap scum and hard water spots. Then follow our handy dishwasher cleaning guide to learn how to scrub the accessories and tub.

Clean the hood fan filter. This may take a while and may require some very strong chemicals since it’s been gathering grease for a while so it requires a lot of effort to clean it. If you aren’t able to purchase something for it, place it in some hot water, add dish soap, and leave it soaking overnight. The next day, it should be a lot easier to scrub off the grease.

Empty and clean the insides of cabinets. Look out for any baskets, seasoning spills. Remove any shelf liners and wipe down the shelves with a damp cloth. You can also save time by using the brush attachment on your vacuum to suck up any crumbs in a snap.

The most important part, bathrooms:

Scrub the toilets. Visible toilet rings are a definite no-no when it comes time to move out. Get rid of them by using an all-purpose bowl cleaner. Once you’ve finished scrubbing the toilet bowl, wipe down both sides of the seat and the tank with a bleach-based cleaning spray. Be sure to open a window or turn on your bathroom fan when cleaning with bleach.

Scrub the shower and bathtub for scum and hard water spots. Get rid of buildup and mold, and don’t forget to clean under shampoo and conditioner bottles, where soap scum builds up fast. Clean the shower curtain (if applicable).

Don’t forget to give the mirror, sink, and countertops a good wipe.

Dust and wipe the bathroom fan. If you don’t have access to the circuit breaker, use a stepladder and a can of air to dust off your exhaust fan. For a more thorough clean, remove the cover and dust the interior.

If you know you don’t have enough time to thoroughly clean or are too lazy to, hire your local cleaners as many of them already offer move-out cleaning services. With all the stress of moving, this minor luxury could go a long way. We recommend, however, you call in advance during summer months as many people choose to do their moving around then.",https://medium.com/tolobi/easy-to-follow-move-out-cleaning-checklist-to-avoid-arguments-with-your-landlords-and-any-4124d130955e,['Zohaib Shahab'],2022-01-06 14:24:33.625000+00:00,"['Cleaning', 'Move Out Cleaning', 'Property Management', 'Property Inspection', 'Real Estate']"
The Complete Robot Vacuum Cleaners Buying Guide,"A robot vacuum cleaner is a great house keeper to your home as it can complete day-to-day cleaning tasks without you having to pick up a vac yourself, saving your time and energy both. Plus, if you’re short on space, thanks to its compact size, it won’t occupy much room in your home.

If you’re brand new to robot vacuum cleaners, you might be overwhelmed by the number of features and models available. Before you jump the gun and going to buy the first model you can find, ask yourself: what do I really need?

This comprehensive robot vacuum buying guide is intended to provide you with all the information you need to make a wise and informed choice.

To get started, ask yourself these questions first:

How big is your house? Do you have carpets or hardwood? Do you have any budget limits? How often do you clean your floor? Do you mind water stains after mopping the floor? Will you need the robot vacuum to clean your house while you’re away? Do you live in an apartment complex where excessive noise might disturb your neighbors? Do you want your robot cleaner to have both vacuum and mop features? Would you prefer a robot vacuum that can clean every corner of your house?

Now that you have brainstormed and prepared this initial information, it’s time to understand more about this product and the options available.

Why should you get a robot vacuum cleaner?

A robot vacuum keeps things relatively clean and saves you the hassle of hauling out the heavy canister vacuum every time bread crumbs fall on the floor. Robot vacuums are great for daily tidying — picking up stray crumbs, hair of all types, dust bunnies and everything else that finds its way onto your floors.

Many robot vacuums can be scheduled to run as often as multiple times a day, and some app-enabled robots allow you to watch their progress as they clean. If you’re concerned about allergies, Narwal’s product is designed with HEPA Filter, which can prevent allergies.

What are the benefits of a robot vacuum cleaner over upright vacuumer?

If you’re considering bringing a robot vacuum cleaner into your home but aren’t sure whether to take the leap, here are some of the benefits of these autonomous little cleaners.

Time-saving: one of the best aspects of a robot vacuum cleaner is the fact that it cleans your home all by itself. A robot vacuum cleaner saves you valuable time and leaves you one less chore to do yourself.

one of the best aspects of a robot vacuum cleaner is the fact that it cleans your home all by itself. A robot vacuum cleaner saves you valuable time and leaves you one less chore to do yourself. Cleans while you’re out: you can program the robot to run on specific days and at specific times. You can also schedule cleaning for when you’re at work and enjoy the feeling of coming home to a clean house.

Better reach: thanks to their small size, robots can get under heavy furniture that you wouldn’t usually be able to clean yourself.

Vacuum and mopping: many of the newer robot cleaners are dual functions, with mopping capabilities as well as vacuuming. In addition, Narwal solution has an innovative self-cleaning function. The base station auto-detects mops’ dirtiness and wipes out the dirt. Then, the dirt gets stored in a separate tank to be dropped.

Actually, Narwal’s high-tech design makes them a spotlight in your house. APP control: You can operate and control the robot vacuum through a smartphone app. At your fingertips, you can set virtual no-go zones and choose multiple scenarios and cleaning plans.

What to look for in a robot vacuum cleaner?

While using a robot vacuum is easy enough, shopping for one can be overwhelming. Here are the main aspects to look for when considering which one to buy.

Size:

The dimensions of a robot vacuum cleaner determine how well it can get into tight spots, such as under your kitchen cabinets and low-clearance furniture (couches and recliners). If it’s too tall, it won’t be able to reach into these spots, or worse, it will get in and get stuck until you physically free it. Besides, the bigger robot vacuum, the larger dustbin. Robot vacuums don’t use expandable bags like many of their stand-up brethren do, so when it comes to debris capacity, what you see is what you get.

Cleaning modules:

Most robot vacuum cleaners feature the ability to change suction and other cleaning functions to adapt to different floor surfaces, either automatically or with input from you. As for Narwal, you can adjust its suction power and the humidity of the mopping pad through the app.

Filter:

The filter captures small particles and incisible allergens efficiently.

Navigation:

The allure of robot vacuums is their promise to complete their task with minimal management from you. In order to do that, they must be able to navigate a room’s unique layout, maneuver around furniture and other obstacles, and avoid hazards such as falling downstairs and smart-avoiding obstacles.

Mapping:

Robot vacuums with mapping capabilities usually come equipped with an onboard camera or laser reflections to produce a 360-degree view of the room. This allows the robot vac to create a map of the space and locate itself within that map. When the robot maps a house for the first time, speed and accuracy are two key points. The advantage of mapping is the robot will know which areas it has already cleaned and which it hasn’t, to avoid going over the same spot unnecessarily. This feature also reminds it from where to resume cleaning if it must stop and recharge on the midway through the task.

Extra features:

The “Child Lock” feature can protect your child’s safety. This function was designed to help prevent children from getting hurt while improperly using the robot.

Robot cleaner daily cleaning tips

Using a robot vacuum cleaner is usually a pretty straightforward task, but you can help it perform better with these easy tips:

1. Tidy up

Even the most hi-tech sensors can’t navigate around piles of Lego or dirty laundry, so to give the vacuum the best chance of success, have a quick tidy before you leave.

2. Use the timers

Robot vacuums work best if they clean every day. Learn how to use the schedule and set it to clean when you know you’ll be out of the house.

3. Place the Base station in a good location

The Base station should be placed against a wall with enough space on either side of the station and open space in front of it. The open space allows the robot to properly orient itself when it’s sent on a cleaning run and helps it find its way home.

4. Stay home for your robot vacuum’s first 3–5 runs

Many homes have hot spots — a weird door jamb, a lumpy rug — where you will need to rescue your vac. Do a quick run-through beforehand for robot booby traps, like ribbons and pieces of string.

Narwal robot maintaining tips

Robot vacuums will do most of the hard work while you do something else. But even smart vacuums need maintenance to keep them performing at their best. Here are some tips on how to make the most out of your robot vacuum cleaner for longer:

1. Empty the dustbinand wastewater tanks

Depending on how dirty your home is, you will want to empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every use. If you run your robot vacuum daily and don’t have pets, you should empty the dustbin at least once a week. In addition, the water tanks also need cleaning.

2. Clean the filter and dustbin

Cleaning the filter is important because the vacuum doesn’t clean as well when the filter is dirty. You can clean most models’ filters and dustbins with water. Each week, you can clean and thoroughly dry the dustbin while letting the filter air dry. Make sure the filter and dustbin dry completely before you use them again.

3. Clean front wheel, brushes, sensors, and charging contacts

You should do this every two to four weeks. Most robot vacuums come with a cleaning tool with a brush on one end and a cutting blade on the other. Use these to cut out hairs that are wrapped around the brushes and wheel and brush away debris. You can also use a soft dry cloth to dust the sensors and charging contacts of your robot vacuum cleaner.

Follow these tips and you’ll be prolonging the lifespan of your robot vacuum cleaner. If these are not enough, we have gathered other useful suggestions for you:

Shake off the filter every few sessions and replace it every few dozen sessions

Clean the bearings on the caster, and side brushes every few weeks

Replace filters and side brushes a few times per year, the mopping padsabout once a year, and the battery as needed — probably every second year, though that depends on how often you use the robot vacuum cleaner

To Wrap it Up

Vacuuming is one of the most loathed household chores. Robot vacuums don’t have unwieldy cords or hoses to contend with, and they require little effort from you: You can run one from your couch using a smartphone app, and the higher-end models can be programmed to wake up and start cleaning without any intervention at all. Robot vacuums also easily dispose of the most common household debris — including food crumbs, pet hair, dust — making them ideal for routine maintenance and quick cleanings when you’re expecting a guest.

Narwal vacuum robot has a white minimalist design and operates quietly. The noise level is 45 dB when you mopping the floor and 60 dB when vacuuming. In addition, our product also offers self-cleaning, fast charging, strong suction, and APP control.

4 Easy Steps To Learn Sinhala Language Online,"4 Easy Steps To Learn Sinhala Language Online

Sinhala is the most spoken language in Sri Lanka. If you are a tourist or a student or a language learner, these 4 steps will be very effective to learn Sinhala easier anywhere you are lived. So, here are 4 steps to learn the Sinhala language free online.

Step 1: Learn the basics of Sinhala

Not only for Sinhala, if you learning any language, but you must also know the basics of that language. If you are an advanced language learner, I suggest you study the alphabet and grammar parts of Sinhala. If you want to speak day to day using words, I recommend you to use Google Translate and practice pronunciation. I list some weblinks to go to learning basics.

Steps 2: Watch movies with Sinhala subtitles

Image from IMDB

While learning basics, you can find out more words and phrases from movies. It is a very interesting task and you can note down unknown Sinhala words and improve your Sinhala vocabulary. I link out several popular Sinhala subtitles websites to download for your favorite movie Sinhala subtitles.

Step 3: Listen to Sinhala Podcasts

Image from Sinhala Podcast (anchor.fm/owshangi-gayana-senanayaka)

This is a nice way to familiarize yourself with the Sinhala language. You can listen to Sri Lankan native accents and differences between Sinhala speakers. And also, hearing Sinhala radio conversations and watching Sinhala YouTube videos is a very effective way to improve your ear for the Sinhala language.

Step 4: Practise With Sinhala Speakers

OK, next step 4, the next effective step is practicing the Sinhala language with others. So, how can you practice alone without a Sinhala speaker??

You can learn via the Tandem app. What is Tandem app?

Learning a New Language is as Simple as Picking Up a New Habit,"I can already hear you saying it: “You must be joking. It’s not that easy… More like overwhelmingly tough. Maybe impossible.”

You’ll point out the thousands of vocabulary words, the new logic required to understand and apply new grammar rules, the endless conjugations and declensions of so many of our world’s languages.

And some of you might even be saying, “I’m not a language person. That’s just a fact.”

I assure you, you’re mistaken. It’s entirely possible and it’s only as difficult as our imaginations make it out to be. At least once we adapt a bit to how to learn a language. And since you’re reading this now, you are necessarily a language person. All human beings are language people: that’s how we communicate after all! That’s how we survive.

Language is what separates human beings from other animals. If we weren’t all language people, we wouldn’t be the apex predator over all other life on Earth.

So then, how does one learn a whole new language? It’s a big question, I know.

But a language is just a set of habits​. Bare with me.

Have you ever changed a habit? Have you ever decided to eat healthier, to stop saying some word, to start brushing your teeth differently? Really, any new kind of habit will work for our purposes now.

My guess is that yes, indeed you have at some point in your life changed a habit. Moreover, I would even wager you have changed many habits throughout your life. This is how we grow!

If you are capable of changing your habits, then you are capable of learning a language.

At its core, that’s all language really is. When you say the word “oh,” a native or proficient speaker of American English doesn’t need to think. They simply know to open the mouth, round the lips, widen and round the throat, vibrate the vocal chords and then end with an incomplete closure of the lips. In phonetics, this is because that sound is the two-part vowel (also known as a diphthong) /oʊ/.

And as a new speaker of a language, those sorts of oral manipulations seem complicated. Maybe they are. But once you’re used to moving your mouth that way, it becomes second nature.

One advantage for us, though? Changing a habit is much harder than picking up a new one. So here already, we know that if a language is a new set of habits, it demands the same effort applied to create a new habit in our day-to-day lives.

Let’s dive deeper into what I mean by, “language is a set of habits.”

First, as we learned above, we have the habits of our mouths and tongues: how we move them to make a sound, how we round or stretch our lips, how we tense or relax our throat, and so on. We do this seemingly by instinct. But in fact, these are habitual patterns like any other you might’ve acquired from your parents or peers in the first 15 or so years of life.

Then we have logical and grammatical patterns. These patterns are again, simple habitual actions that we acquired from the people we surrounded ourselves with when we were still maturing.

Habit change is a major feature of adaptation: the evolutionary process which allows an organism to live despite changes in its optimal environment or situation.

So now we know that a language is just one, big habit. We just adapt, right? Simple.

Well sadly, I think 2020 made it pretty clear that life is never that easy. At least with learning a new language, we can dispose of the existential fear and simply focus on the material!

Next, we need to understand a little about the brain.

​

I’m not going to bore you with learning about the various parts of the brain, nor if consciousness can be explained through quantum physics.

Nah, all we need to know is how our brains — our minds — react to change.

In short, when our brain is forced to change, it starts to lash out. Like a child who’s been told they (ESL students: See they, singular, gender neutral pronoun) can’t have ice cream. Our brain — the wonderfully evolved and endlessly complex thing it is — essentially acts like a child when it doesn’t get its way.

And the way the brain likes it? In short: never, ever change!

In cognitive psychology over the decades, we’ve learned that when a human being tries to change one of their habits, their brain responds by producing unpleasant or difficult feelings. It yells at us saying, “this isn’t right.” It tries its best to convince us of this “fact” by providing difficult emotional feedback.

Why? Because change and adaptation require energy, and for the people of pre-technological civilizations (as well as those living in extreme poverty today), energy wasn’t always an easy thing to maintain. The more energy expended, the more food we needed, and the higher the chances we would die from the lack of it. Our brain — and our body as a whole — is very against any sort of energetic waste.

Without these neurological systems, the hundreds of millions of those who live in extreme poverty today would not survive.

Additionally, once we finally adapt to a new situation, the brain concretely considers this situation “safe.” But because change means facing the unknown, the brain instinctively labels any “strange” situation as “unsafe.” So it stays the same or it starts the process of adaptation. That’s the point where we deny its comfortable emotional safety but assure it that we will be OK!

That makes two reasons (among many) that we experience these difficulties in learning anything — especially a new language.

Indeed, the brain never has grown beyond its childhood tantrums. Even if you’ve managed to reign those in on the outside. On the inside, it’s always going to be bossy and forceful. But don’t think of it as puerile or spoiled. It’s just afraid.

And what’s the brain’s main job? Keeping us alive. Keeping us safe. That’s the purpose of fear.

So don’t judge your brain! It loves you! The only reason it reacts this way is to keep you breathing. Our DNA has programmed our neurology to think that the unknown means danger, and since change means facing the unknown, change equals danger.

Let’s not take that for granted, though. This mechanism is critical to our survival, even today.

And in case you were wondering, this internal resistance to change is lovingly referred to as cognitive dissonance.

The fun doesn’t stop there, though.

When we learn, the brain physically changes in structure. In my simplistic understanding of the subject: basically, the folds in our brain are where information is stored and the way that information is transferred among the various parts of the brain. When we need to access specific information often, the folds create a smooth pathway to and from the proper places in order to access and utilize it with efficiency.

So when we are learning a whole new language, the brain is forced to not only learn new facts, but also to create new pathways in order to access those things in the most energy-efficient way possible. If only our own technology were a little more like our bodies, right? Maybe we could avoid issues like the inevitable disaster of climate change and the greed-fueled wars over oil.

Digressing once again, those neural pathways which are already present and easy to use are also collectively named the default mode network. Our brain loves this network as this is where it feels safe and comfy. But that’s also what sets the scene for dissonances. So if something new comes into our awareness, the brain throws a tantrum and on and on we go!

For this reason and try as we might, in the beginning of our language journey, it’s downright impossible to speak with ease or to understand other speakers, even at normal speeds. That language either has no pathway to use, or the pathway is very, very rough. Eek! Inefficient and incomplete. Dissonance party! Cue the inability to express ourselves in the new language. And that inability goes beyond simple cognitive dissonance: it’s a physical limitation that only practice can overcome. Those pathways must physically be constructed and the only way to do that is practice.

All right then. Now we know there’s an emotional component and a physical component of why language learning can be difficult.

So back to habits.

As we learned, the sounds of a language are all just a set of routine behaviors. The grammar, the structures, the forms, the patterns, the rhythm, the writing, the spelling, the idiomatic expressions, and so on and so forth: they’re all habits.

So, how do we change a habit? Practice and believe!

Yes, that’s really all there is to it! You just need to practice regularly to create new pathways and overcome the resulting cognitive dissonance.

Remember, dissonance has a lot to do with feelings of safety. As a result, simply convincing your brain of the following things will drastically simplify the process for us:

Required beliefs for pacifying the angry, dissonant brain: 1. You are safe. 2. You aren’t wasting energy. and

​

3. You need this skill.

I know, it’s yet another list of rote learning. Most of us aren’t a fan — even those who do consider ourselves “language people!” Making ourselves believe something is totally possible, though so don’t stress.

It’s all about repetition. The more you do it, the easier it becomes. Repetition sends the signal to your brain that this skill is necessary and as such, the mind starts chilling out a little. The tantrums calm down in intensity and frequency until one day, your brain barely has them at all!

We’ve got some basics of habits, we’ve got cognitive psychology, and even a little bit of neurology thrown in to spice things up. Let’s add some traditional Eastern wisdom, verified by science. This basic mindfulness practice will help ease the headache and give your brain more than a fighting chance. Again, this is really simple.

When you feel the dissonance, you must accept the associated emotions and then challenge the ideas they’re trying to reinforce.

If you try to deny the feeling of “this isn’t right,” then you will only encourage more of the same feeling, and that may make the problem worse. So the first step is to fully acknowledge and accept the feeling for what it is: a feeling. No more, no less. And feelings alone pose no real threat to your existence.

Dive deep into those sensations (or any others). Feel to the finer details. At first, you can try labeling them in a calm, warm voice in your head: “There’s anxiety,” “there’s a headache,” “there’s happiness,” and so on. Pleasant or not, let that voice treat them exactly the same — with equanimity.

Experiment with going deeper into specific sensations — again both pleasant and unpleasant. Go from sensing its existence to being curious about the finer details of it: where is it? Is the sensation moving? Is it intense or light? Is it connected to another part of the body? Notice the texture of the sensation. A sensation detective, you should get as curious as you can without forcing anything. But remember: equanimity is key.

Yes, sometimes feelings get in the way of us achieving our goals. However, the more we learn to accept and feel our every sensation fully, the more those same feelings that get in the way become less important and eventually fade away, leaving room for more pleasant and less burdensome emotions in the future.

But that doesn’t mean you will be accepting this feeling as a way to define your reality or the facts of a given situation! On the contrary, you will simultaneously accept the feeling as simply that — a feeling, nothing less and nothing more — and you will challenge the belief (“I can’t do this”) with a new one. That is: you replace the old, self-defeating belief with one that helps you. Even if that, too causes dissonance.

For example, you could use this script when you feel the brain starting to throw a dissonance tantrum:

Hello there, dissonance. Welcome. You are totally free to visit. You don’t define my reality, even though you are here to keep me safe. I appreciate you for that, but I can learn a language and I am going to continue to practice. I know that, even if I don’t believe it in my heart at this very moment, I am totally capable and I have all the necessary skills to be successful at learning this new language. I am completely safe, and I know it’s worth the time and energy engaging myself in this task.

​Now, maybe this sort of phrasing isn’t right for you. That’s okay! Whatever works! As long as you’re accepting the feeling for what it is, and challenging the belief that stems from that feeling and making sure you’re using compassion rather than scorn when giving it attention, you’re good to go. Each time you do this, repeat the above quote (or your own version). It’s okay if you don’t truly believe it immediately. Repetition will lead to belief.

All it takes to believe something is to insist on thinking it! My French students of the English language call this la méthode coué and, according to Wikipedia, it’s called “autosuggestion” in English.

Some of you may ask, “But what if I’m just too embarrassed to speak?” My suggestion remains the same. Feel that feeling, identify it compassionately. Then ask yourself, “Where is this feeling coming from? What thought or belief is bringing this emotion to the surface?”

Maybe you’ll think, “I know how I see people who speak my language badly sometimes. It’s just natural. We associate low-level language skills with children. So I know people are going to look at me sideways and sometimes will totally misunderstand me. It could lead to a bad situation. What if I offend someone? I’ll be so embarrassed!”

Anything can happen! The ceiling could come crumbling down upon you right now. Just replace those thoughts with, “I’m confident with my language skills. I’m doing my very best at the present moment, and I can only improve from here. Anyone who judges me probably doesn’t speak another language and has no place around me. Their judgements are meaningless because I know who I am and how smart I really am.”

Or something like that.

Regardless, making mistakes is imperative to learning anything. I call these formative errors.

As an aside, the key difference between the aforementioned method and what I’m describing in this post is that for us, the practice of emotional willingness via mindfulness is critical in keeping the emotions from becoming blockages in your learning and practice. Mindfulness isn’t just beneficial for learning a new language, but for pretty much everything in your life. For now, you can just look at the numerous pieces of research on the topic.

In summary: notice those feelings and then feel​ them intentionally then once you’re centered enough, identify and change the thoughts and beliefs that cause them. Allow yourself time and practice with these skills, just like any other.

English: The most important thing is how you see yourself.

With these small changes in your thinking and behavior, you will make remarkable strides in your learning. At first, these changes will be subtle. But trust me, they will occur. Persist even when you don’t see any new skills developing. The brain will play cat-and-mouse with you sometimes. Don’t let it psych you out. Sometimes it takes longer for it to “get into the mode,” of learning a language than it does for other things. But it will click one day as long as you don’t give up. When it does, you’ll see the world in a whole new and exciting way.

Just one more thing: sleep is essential for the process of creating new neurological pathways and creating long-term memories. So make sure you’re getting enough sleep!

Awesome! Now you’re ready to continue your journey. Go forth and create your own confidence in your target language!

Oh and by the way: congrats! Reading this article counts as one step of the learning process you can check off your list! Look at you. Already a step forward. Boom.

5 Amazing Doable Tips to do Effective and Competitive Workout for Mental Health,"How workout affects both your body and mind.

We already have an awareness that workout is essential for our body. But did you know it is also essential for our mental health, assisting to cope with depression, anxiety, stress, boosting our mood, and more?

Workout is not just about good-looking and muscle size. Undeniable, exercise can enhance your physique, physical appearance and even to some extent augment years of your life. Nevertheless, this doesn’t inspire most of the people to have associated.

Therefore, let`s speak about the apex five intellectual advantages of keeping fit.

Workout and Stress

That moment your physical body feels when you are under stress. Your face clearly depicts the situations what you’re going through. The stress doesn’t stop there; it creates insomnia, heartburn, diarrhea, or frequent urination. The worry and discomfort of all these physical symptoms can in turn lead to even more stress, creating a vicious cycle between your mind and body.

The best way to deal with all these uncanny symptoms is to do work out on a daily basis. Physical activity helps to relax the muscles and relieve tension in the body. The connection between the body and mind are so close, when your body feels better so, too, will your mind does.

Workout and Depression

Studies have shown that workout impacts on mind without any side effects, in terms of depression more effectively than anti-depression does. Recent research done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has shown that walking for 15 minutes a day or for an hour reduces the risk of major depression. Moreover; letting go of depression symptoms working out on schedule can prevent you from deteriorating.

Exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in your brain that energize your spirits and make you feel good. Finally, exercise can also serve as a distraction, allowing you to find some quiet time to break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression.

Workout and Anxiety

The only viable way to tackle down anxiety is doing physical practice. It eases pressure and stress, helps physical and mental energy, and upgrades prosperity through the onset of endorphins. Whatever gets you going can help; however, you’ll get a greater advantage if you pay attention instead of daydreaming.

Attempt to see the vibe of your feet hitting the ground, for instance, or the musicality of your breathing, or the sensation of the breeze on your skin. In addition to this attentiveness element; truly concentrating on your body and how it feels when you work out, you’ll only not elevate your physical appearance faster, yet you may likewise have the option to interfere with the progression of steady concerns going through your mind.

Workout and ADHD

Practicing routinely is one of the least demanding and best ways of diminishing the side effects of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and further develops focus, inspiration, memory, and disposition. Actual work quickly supports the brain’s dopamine, norepinephrine (a substance that sends signals between nerve cells), and serotonin levels (the key hormone that stabilizes our mood, feelings of well-being, and happiness) — all of which influence concentration and consideration. Thusly, practice works similarly to ADHD prescriptions like Ritalin and Adderall.

Workout and PTSD and Trauma

Proof proposes that by truly concentrating on your body and how it feels as you work out, you can really assist your nervous system with becoming “released” and start to move out of the immobilization stress reaction that describes PTSD or injury. Rather than permitting your brain to meander, give close consideration to the actual sensations in your joints and muscles, even your inner parts as your body moves. Practices that include cross-development and that engage both arms and legs — like strolling (particularly in sand), running, swimming, weight preparing, or moving — are a portion of your most ideal decisions.

Open-air exercises like climbing, cruising, mountain trekking, rock ascending, whitewater boating, and skiing (downhill and cross-country) have likewise been displayed to lessen the manifestations of PTSD.

Conclusion

You don’t need to go through hours in a gym center or power yourself into long, repetitive workouts to encounter the many advantages of activity. These tips can assist you with observing exercises you appreciate and begin to feel good, look better, and get more out of life.",https://medium.com/@abamynqu/5-amazing-doable-tips-to-do-effective-and-competitive-workout-for-mental-health-def8cdc4438d,['Ab Amyn'],2022-01-24 10:31:59.938000+00:00,"['Running', 'Workout', 'Mentalhealth', 'Fitness', 'Physicalfitness']"
FlippED: DC Vs Marvel: Which Is The Better Universe: Our Bloggers Fight It Out,"FlippED is an ED Original style wherein two bloggers come together and share their opposing or orthogonal perspectives on an interesting subject.

For decades, comic book movies have kept people going to the theatres. Both Marvel fans and DC fans can agree on this fact. They have kept us entertained, excited and motivated.

While both have their own drawbacks and advantages, they started with a dream, an idea. And here we stand now. While most art is getting polluted with corporate interference, some are trying to keep the dream and the art alive.

The argument remains. Who is better- DC or Marvel? Someone has to be better than the other to make the comparison as undiplomatic as possible. Let’s get right into it!

“DC is the layered labyrinth of a disturbed mind, which seeks liberation. Which screams freedom” - Blogger Debanjan Dasgupta’s

DC Comics, or known previously as Detective Comics Inc., originating in the year 1934, does not merely hold the record for being one of the oldest comic book producers, but also one which inspired many after it. Like, of course, Marvel. But being the oldest doesn’t mean being the best. It’s not wine. It’s a comic book company. Stories get old. What exactly does DC have, watching which isn’t necessarily supposed to entertain you like a theme park ride, like Marvel? DC is the layered labyrinth of a disturbed mind, which seeks liberation. Which screams freedom.

Let’s first talk Characters! Everyone knows the characters in DC. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman. One might have said that these characters are from a child’s dream, arguably, if not for Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight Trilogy”. The Dark Knight Trilogy was not a part of the DCEU, but it was definitely a milestone in its own cinematic way. The first DCEU movie was Zack Snyder’s “Man of Steel”, and with a critical eye, Nolan’s influence is evident. It was not just the DCEU movies that got inspired by Nolan’s character development, but also Marvel.

Showing realistic political unrest brought down by interstellar forces, autocratic/dystopian systems, villains raised by the society and human-like characters, struggling with their own physical restraints is something every comic book movie does these days. So, the question that arises, in that case, is “Who Did It First?”

There was a movie based on a DC comic almost 15 years ago. It was called “V for Vendetta”. A lot of people believe that V for Vendetta is not originally DC’s, as the producers of the comic approached DC while the comic was halfway through. But anyway, the idea was carried forward. What the movie showed still remains with the mass.

Darling, all I know are sad songs

Let’s see what ruined the DCEU, now. Because, no matter how much we argue, the fact remains that the DCEU is ruined. It was corporate interference. Warner Bros wanted to compete with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which was making it big by bringing all of their individual superhero movies together, creating this dream-like scenario that fans could only imagine before that. Of course, the MCU was earning billions upon billions with every single release because they are more business-minded, unlike the DC universe, who still believe in art.

Warner Bros thought they should do it as well without even creating proper character arcs because they might have thought that these characters have been going on for hundreds of years now. And that if they bring the characters together, they will create a huge thing!

Yes, showing Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash in one frame is something huge! But Warner Bros did not let DC do its job with building the character arcs first before jumping into bringing these together.

We know how miserably they failed. Zack Snyder’s cut of the Justice League movie was definitely better than the previous one, but it lacked what it lacked. We could not connect with the characters as much as we were supposed to. We could not feel the same emotional intensity like we did when Iron Man died.

Two years ago, Joker came out starring Joaquin Phoenix. The movie was no short of a masterpiece. If anyone did it after Heath Ledger, it was this guy, but sadly this movie was not by the DCEU either. But they should understand what works for them now.

Competing with Marvel is not going to work anymore because they must understand that they are different. If Marvel is a Bollywood action movie, DC is an art-house drama. While Marvel is targeting everyone, regardless of their age, class, ethnicity, DC cannot do that. Because both of them have created a brand for themselves, and they are different from one another.

DC is better with cinematic expressions, building characters, and it definitely awes those who have a taste for it. But not everyone is prepared to solve extreme puzzles after a hard week when they just want to be entertained! Cinematically, DC is better. Martin Scorsese was right, Marvel is a ride through the theme park.

“It is similar to Bollywood action movies, but the physics makes sense here!” - Blogger Charlotte Mondal

Marvel Comics is the brand name and primary imprint of Marvel Worldwide, Inc. formerly known as Marvel Publishing, Inc. It was started in 1939 as Timely Comics whereas the Marvel era began in 1961 when the company launched The Fantastic Four. Hence, the Marvel brand was solidified as the primary brand.

Marvel’s characters are as iconic and evergreen as the day they were created. They are the most well-known due to their simple nature and extremely entrancing storylines. Spiderman, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Thor, The Hulk and Black Widow are the most well-known ones among the general population.

Marvel has been winning the DC vs Marvel fight for quite a couple of decades now owing to its tendency of creating intricate universes that mesh with each other seamlessly.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe makes some of the most entertaining and detailed movies with the special added effects being their rock-solid wall of secrecy that is maintained with great efforts by everyone involved in the production.

Marvel while writing its stories keep certain things in mind. They try to create something that can be enjoyed by both children and grownups. The lack of complicacies in these movies provides the audience with what they want when they want to be entertained. It is similar to Bollywood action movies, but the physics makes sense here!

While the DCEU is still trying to figure out exactly how “dark” they are going to make their stories, Marvel is achieving it all in the light. While DCEU is going on using the same “Dark Knight Trilogy” formula, MCU is winning hearts. It won’t be an exaggeration to say that Marvel made the entire world shed some tears when Iron Man died.

Those of us who grew up watching these movies instantly remembered how tiny we were. Our legs would not reach the floor of the theatre. But we understood the movie!

The first Iron Man movie, where he’s building a suit for himself, flying around, fighting! We associate good times with these movies. Whereas those of us who have tried watching The Dark Knight as a kid because we heard that there was Batman in it, probably fell asleep 5 minutes into it.

Iron Man’s death was not the end of an era, but also a big push for everyone who was watching it, regardless of whether he or she was a fan. It was a realization that we were growing up.

The Times They Are a-Changin’

Of course, Marvel cannot and should not be compared with DC. Other than the fact that Marvel is better than DC, there’s also the fact that DC has fallen victim to the corporate drama. While the directors and writers know what they want, and probably what the audience wants, it’s the producers who are under the impression that DC fans want what Marvel is doing. That is not true.

Both are necessary in this world. Raw realism, showing the vulnerability even superheroes aren’t spared, and pure entertainment, bringing warmth and joy to billions of people watching it.

But we know who is better when it comes to making people feel more connected to a character. It’s Marvel. We know who is better when it comes to visually thrilling people with VFX. It’s Marvel! We know who is better at storytelling which is accessible to everyone. Marvel!

You Choose!

Again, both are good in their own way, and both are bad. But in the end of it’s up to us whom we are going to like, justify and defend.

‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ Becomes First Pandemic-Era Movie to Smash $1 Billion Milestone Globally.,"“ Spider-Man: No Way Home “ unwrapped the best Christmas gift of all, becoming the first pandemic-era movie to cross $1 billion at the global box office.

Sony’s comic-book epic has eclipsed that milestone in a near-record 12 days, tying with 2015’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” as the third-fastest film to reach the billion-dollar benchmark. Only 2018’s “Avengers: Infinity War” and 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame” were quicker, smashing the coveted tally in 11 and five days, respectively.

It’s impressive that “Spider-Man: No Way Home” managed to blow past $1 billion in ticket sales worldwide given the rapidly spreading omicron variant of COVID-19. But, so far, coronavirus concerns have done little to slow Peter Parker’s prowess; the film is still playing to many sold-out screenings nationwide. The achievement makes Tom Holland’s Marvel superhero adventure the only movie since 2019’s “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” to surpass $1 billion globally. No other Hollywood film has come close to nearing those box office revenues in the last two years. Prior to Spidey’s reign, MGM’s James Bond sequel “No Time to Die,” which grossed $774 million globally, came the closest and stood as the highest-grossing Hollywood film of 2021 (and the pandemic).

With $1 billion banked, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” also took the earthly throne from another box-office behemoth, China’s local-language war film “The Battle at Lake Changjin” ($902 million globally), officially cementing its place as the year’s highest-grossing film worldwide. It’s also notable that “No Way Home” surpassed that high-watermark without playing in China, which is currently the world’s biggest moviegoing market.

At the domestic box office, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” had another dominant weekend, soaring high above the competition during a crowded Christmas corridor. The newest “Spider-Man” adventure collected $81 million from 4,336 North American theaters over the weekend, down 69% from its jaw-dropping debut. To put its second-weekend figure in perspective, only select COVID-era releases have managed to generate that kind of coinage in their entire theatrical runs, much less in their sophomore outings. “Spider-Man: No Way Home” also managed to do so at a time when several new movies — “ The Matrix Resurrections,” “ Sing 2 “ and “The King’s Man,” among others — opened nationwide to decent (and not-so-decent) ticket sales.

It brings the film’s ten-day total to a mammoth $467 million at the domestic box office. That tally is more than double the year’s next highest-grossing movie, Disney and Marvel’s “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” which earned a mighty $224 million domestically. At the international box office, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” added $121.4 million over the weekend and has made $587 million to date, boosting its global revenues to $1.05 billion.

Universal and Illumination’s animated musical “Sing 2” had the biggest start among new releases, debuting in second place with $23.7 million from 3,892 domestic theaters over the traditional weekend and $41 million since Wednesday. (That number is slightly inflated because it includes $1.6 million banked from advanced screenings over Thanksgiving weekend.) It’s a softer start than its predecessor, 2016’s “Sing,” which had secured a three-day total of $35 million and five-day tally of $54.9 million. However, it’s not a bad result for a film targeted at parents with young kids at a time when family audiences have been especially wary about going to the movies.

“The industry has been saying family audiences haven’t been coming out, but we proved that wrong,” said Universal’s president of domestic distribution Jim Orr.

The jukebox sequel, directed by Garth Jennings and voiced by Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson, Nick Kroll and Bono, has been well-received by audiences, who awarded it a coveted “A+” CinemaScore. Unless the pandemic has something to say, “Sing 2” should benefit from a long run on the big screen, especially since it doesn’t have much competition among family films. The original “Sing,” centering on a bevy of animals with killer pipes, also bowed around Christmas and played in theaters well into the new year, ultimately grossing $270 million stateside and $634 million worldwide. At this rate, the sequel will have trouble replicating those results but it should remain the de facto choice for youngsters through the holiday season.

Other new nationwide releases struggled to pull ticket buyers away from “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” “The Matrix Resurrections,” Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow’s sci-fi sequel, landed with a thud in third place. The cerebral film arrived significantly behind expectations, scraping together $12 million from 3,552 cinemas over the weekend and $22.5 million since Wednesday. The fourth installment in the seminal series, like Warner Bros. entire 2021 slate, is available simultaneously on HBO Max, though the company didn’t provide digital viewership metrics.

Internationally, the latest “Matrix” entry has generated $47 million so far, which brings its global haul to $69.8 million.

Lana Wachowski returned to direct “The Matrix Resurrections,” which stars Keanu Reeves as the sleek cybercriminal Neo and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity. The $190 million-budgeted tentpole has gotten mixed responses (it has a 67% on Rotten Tomatoes, as well as a “B-” CinemaScore), which may not move the needle for ticket sales while it’s playing simultaneously on a streaming service at no extra charge.

“Right now, if you’re under 35 and going to the movies, your first choice is ‘Spider-Man,’ and your second choice is seeing ‘Spider-Man’ again,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “You can watch ‘The Matrix’ later with someone who has HBO. That’s how it is when a single movie is dominating the market the way ‘Spider-Man’ is.”

Another newcomer, Disney and 20th Century’s “The King’s Man” finished in fourth place, amassing a paltry $6.3 million from 3,180 screens over the weekend and $10 million since debuting on Wednesday. Overseas, the prequel in “The Kingsman” action franchise didn’t make up much ground. The oft-delayed spy comedy, starring Ralph Fiennes, nabbed only $6.9 million from seven international markets for a global tally of $16.9 million.

At the domestic box office, “The King’s Man” beat Lionsgate’s real-life sports drama “American Underdog” by a hair. In fifth place, “American Underdog” captured $6.2 million from 2,813 locations since opening on Christmas Day. The crowd-pleasing film about rags-to-riches quarterback Kurt Warner (played by Zachary Levi) has been embraced by moviegoers, who gave it an “A+” CinemaScore and 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, the movie hasn’t been high on audience’s radars and could get sacked by competitors over the busy holiday stretch.

Strong reviews didn’t do much to boost Disney’s big-budget “West Side Story” remake, which landed at №6 in its third weekend of release with $2.8 million from 2,810 venues. The Steven Spielberg-directed musical has generated $23.9 million domestically since launching earlier in December. The song-and-dance property has also had a slow go at it overseas, grossing only $12.7 million from 46 international territories so far. Globally, the $100 million-budgeted “West Side Story” has earned just $36.6 million to date.

Even with the rousing success of Sony’s “Spider-Man” threequel, it wasn’t all good news on the movie studio’s lot. Sony’s latest new nationwide release, the tear-jerker “A Journal for Jordan,” barely managed to crack the top 10. Despite a high-wattage director and star in Denzel Washington and Michael B. Jordan, the film notched eighth place with a scant $2.2 million in receipts from 2,500 venues on Saturday and Sunday.

“A Journal for Jordan” sold less tickets than director Paul Thomas Anderson’s coming-of-age comedic drama “Licorice Pizza,” which expanded to 786 North American theaters on Christmas Day after four weeks in limited release. The movie, starring Cooper Hoffman and Alana Haim, collected $2.32 million on Saturday and Sunday, enough for seventh place. To date, the MGM film and awards season hopeful has generated $3.6 million domestically.",https://medium.com/@FilmSection/spider-man-no-way-home-becomes-first-pandemic-era-movie-to-smash-1-billion-milestone-globally-bd4a972e0de9,['Film Section'],2022-01-08 20:31:58.375000+00:00,"['Spider Man', 'Spider Man No Way Home', 'Marvel', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'Mcu']"
The Savior in “Spider-Man: Homecoming”,"The Demiurge extends outwardly in another way, as a general spiritual ‘zeitgeist’ that blows between each of us and all around.

A significant expression is found in our highest moral and judicial authorities; as “Matriarchy” and as “Patriarchy”.

The pressures from these two ‘gods’ touch us every day, and manifest in many different ways; between personal relationships, among faculty and staff, written into policy, code, and law; and as latent, reactionary “chemicals” in our individual and collective subconscious.

In spirit, both are aspects of the same Demiurge, and both are conveyed by the apparatus of the state. The gendering of the literal expression is mixed, but is principally male. This is the state as in government, and as a state of mind — and states always change, slowly or suddenly.

Our present situation is a transition between a masculine conscious dominant and one that’s feminine, as is reflected in astrology’s metaphor of the movement from Pices (fish) into the age of Aquarius (water). These transitions are historically accompanied by large outputs of novel mythology synthesized out of the symbolic language of previous generations. Not perfectly overlapping, but rhyming. (I don’t have an opinion on the ‘realness’ of astrology, nor many of the other concepts in this post. I’m just interested in searching for the presence of pattern.)

Each Age is a day, and the transition between them is the darkness.

Matriarchy and Patriarchy each comes with their own light and shadow; Benign spirits and their aggressive shades, working together in dance or in conflict to produce distorted beauty and flawed order.

The human act of creation and need for control; the shifting rules of law and and those of morality — both are right and wrong, and both are often correct in their criticisms of the other. Each recognizes the other’s shadow, but remains ignorant of its own.

This paradoxical division reflects the devious ‘twoness’ of Two, and serves here as one example of many drives conducting our behavior. The flaws of law and morality can be seen as the flaw, or ‘sin’ of flesh — symbols and archetypes born into our reality through the imperfections of body and mind.

The Class System Of NFTMan: An Overview,"Eight classes of Heroes with absolutely different appearances.

There are eight unique classes of heroes living in the imaginative world of NFTMan and each of them has different abilities and features.

Correspondingly, there are eight types of equipment. They are swords, boxing gloves, bow and arrow, shield, twin blades, ax, hammer, mage staff, and so on. Weapons also vary in appearance.

NFTMan breaks the traditional concept of game classes. For example, Knights no longer need to wear heavy armor; Mages no longer need to wear robes. Through our genetic system, you can customize the appearance of your NFT heroes. Although the appearance of heroes is imaginative and various, you can always identify their classes by their equipment.

Equipped with boxing gloves, fighter is both offensive and defensive, capable of playing any position in the team.

Moreover, a hero’s class will take effect on his skills. For example, heroes who use one-handed swords, ultimate skills, and basic skills are all related to one-handed swords.

Some words on the Divine Fund,"Divine Inu,

We sincerely hope that all of you had a good break over Christmas.

The core team had a couple of days off, and are now back in the game again.

The Divine Fund is a development, investment and reward-generating fund managed by the core team. Inside it contains an index of tokens and NFT’s from various blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. Any tokens or coins captured as a result of our project or it’s tokenomics are deposited into this fund and provide another layer of value for the investors and the project.

As long as blockchains remain in operation, one thing will not change: Seed and private sale investors enjoy the most benefits. By using our contacts and expertise in the crypto space, we can leverage this fact to our advantage.

To further compliment this, we’ll also be adding a stable of blue chip cryptocurrencies and finishing up with altcoins.

If the Divine Fund is managed efficiently and its assets outperform the market, the value locked within it could exceed the value of our native token, which will reduce our investors’ portfolio risk exposure as a result.

Utilizing investment and yield farming profits from the Divine Fund, the native tokens will be bought back at certain intervals and stored, increasing value and scarcity of our native token while also increasing reflections rewards towards the project.

Unlike the fund, which aims to maximize yield for its investors, the Reserve aims to support our community growth initiatives and other activities solely aimed at growing our user base.

Projects may apply for funding from the Divine Fund.

If we believe that the potential outweighs the risk after proper risk management procedures have been carried out, we will then invest in the project and in return, receive their native token and stash those in our fund.

By staking the Divine Inu token— the investor is given the right to dividend payouts from the fund as well as getting NFT’s unlocked and eventually sent to his or her wallet.

All the best,",https://medium.com/@divineinucrypto/some-words-on-the-divine-fund-85788f68c691,['Divine Inu'],2022-01-16 12:01:57.855000+00:00,"['Bnb', 'Defi', 'Bsc', 'Crypto', 'Bitcoin']"
Flight of the Navigator Update v16,"Here’s what to expect this new year. I’ve debated between breaking this down by quarters, or by topic. I’ve opted for the latter as we’re still nailing down our roadmaps for each of the projects, however I’ll attempt to be as specific as I can with the information I currently have available. Over the next few weeks we’ll be publishing more documents digging into the projects in more details with a more detailed roadmap. I’ll also attempt to answer any questions I’ve seen from the community so far.

$NICE $CRUSH you got there-

First let’s talk about the elephant in the room. Dumpers. God I hate dumpers. For the most part it seems like most sells are coming from other projects, and I think that makes sense as they may not really understand the Bitcrush as a whole.

The bad news is there’s not much we can do about dumpers, aside from continuing to try and educate users, as well as bring in more buyers. That being said, we are very close to being deflationary. At this point 88% of $CRUSH rewards have been distributed, and only about 1.2M remain. That may sound like a lot, but in about 4–6 weeks we’re done.

So what happens then?

$CRUSH becomes almost entirely deflationary. What I mean by that is while we still have 10M allocated for P2E, the rate of emission for those $CRUSH will be slower than the burn rate of $CRUSH. The numbers aren’t final yet, but I believe that P2E will start at 1 $CRUSH earned for every 1000 wagered. When you take into account a 1% house edge, that means for every 1000 wagered, 10 $CRUSH average is profit, and 1% of that (.1) Crush is burned. However, we also need to take into account additional burn mechanisms from other Live Wallet tokens, Black Hodle referrals, Crush n Burn lottery, and the auto-compound burns. Essentially, in approximately 4–6 weeks, the only way to get $CRUSH will be to play games, purchase it, or be staked in our Staking Pool 2.0.

Which brings up the point, if there’s no more $CRUSH for rewards, what will that look like. This is where $NICE comes in. For those unaware, a second token was always the plan, and is even in the whitepaper.

As the core CRUSH coin supply decreases and price increases, the CRUSH coin will become a share token, and additional Crush Chips will be introduced with varying supply to address medium and lower wagering markets. The emphasis will always be on the staked CRUSH Coins to mine APY and receive the house profits. The highest pool multipliers will always be for crush coin pools and LPs.

It wasn’t possible back then to know what it would look like exactly as it rolled out, but now that we’re here we have a much better idea. While we are still locking down the tokenomics of $NICE, here’s what we know.

$CRUSH will be transitioning to a share token. Meaning, profits from all products, protocols, and everything we do will go to $CRUSH stakers. Staking $CRUSH is your ticket to profiting from the entire ecosystem.

What does this mean? Game profits will continue to be shared with stakers. N.I.C.E. Invader profits will be shared with stakers. All upcoming marketplace profits will be shared with stakers, and so on.

Additionally, the new games all introduce massive use cases for $CRUSH. N.I.C.E. Invaders requires planets to stake $CRUSH to earn $NICE. They will need to level up and as they do, which requires more $CRUSH. Attacking other planets requires $CRUSH be put up as sort of a wager and can be lost. We’re still deciding if that lost $CRUSH should be burned, or become profit for stakers. In game there will be Black Hodles that syphon resources and will potentially burn or distribute $CRUSH. We will share more about these when we begin launching the gitbook.

This is just the game, we still have the open world we’re working on and more. The point here is that $CRUSH inflation is coming to an end, and we’re just getting started with increased use cases. Below I’ll discuss where we are in development of these.

$NICE will be our inflationary rewards token, and will be taking the place of APY rewards. This means that we will soon be launching our own pools, farms, and even swap (albeit I don’t yet see the need to become a DEX). We’re currently discussing whether the fees from these will be used to buy back $CRUSH and burn, or buy back $CRUSH and distribute to stakers. Either way it will have a positive price impact on $CRUSH.

In addition, $NICE will be the mined in game currency that will be used to upgrade game assets, and more. Any items bought/sold on the marketplace will create profit to be shared with $CRUSH stakers.

Long story short, $CRUSH is becoming the share token to reap the rewards from all daily activities transacted by $NICE, as well as getting a big boost in use case.

Bitcrush Arcade Core-

This rollout has been super frustrating to say the least, however we’re getting there. Just as a bug gets fixed, another pops it. Any techies out there know it’s always harder to fix someone else’s mistakes than to just build something yourself. The issues that need to be fixed are the hybrid API and Dice Invaders roll function. Now that the Api is pretty much working properly, we’re moving along to update our servers so we can rollout the rest of the items on the list.

Here’s what to expect in chronological order.

Crush n’Burn Lottery — First week of January. We’re that close.

BUSD Live Wallet — Should be finished 2nd-3rd week of January, and then submitted for audit. Will go live as soon as audit is finished.

Dice Invaders — DI just needs to adjust how it retrieves rolls to increase its speed. This isn’t necessarily difficult, it just hasn’t been priority as the other items are more critical. However I believe we will be seeing this mid January. Since this doesn’t require audits there’s a chance it could drop before the live wallet update, but unsure.

Pools/Farms/Swap — These will be coming soon actually. Likely in Feb as soon as $NICE is rolled out.

Referrals and Wager mining — Neither of these are difficult, but neither are they priority. However, we should be seeing progress on these late Jan into Feb.

Bitcrush Arcade As A Service — We’re taking our time with this one after what happened with Treasure Key. A version of this is still being planned, we’re just being cautious. Once the above products are rolled out we’ll have a much better idea. Our lottery may in fact be the first BCAAAS product we roll out. We could maybe see that as soon as Feb.

Additional Games — Look for these to begin development likely in March I believe. If things go well we may try and push them sooner.

Nice Invaders Crush Everything-

This is interesting, as while it’s new for many of you, it’s always been the plan. For the sake of keeping this from getting too long, we’ll roll the Invaderverse into this section as well.

In fact here’s a quick screen grab from our earliest WP back in 2019, when we were referring to the game as crypto castles. This was pre-DeFi, and the best chain for casinos back then was Tron 😑.

Clearly the un-edited version was all I could locate.

Thank god the space has developed since then, but the point remains that casino was always only going to be a first use case. While the space and the concept has dramatically evolved, Bitcrush at its core has remained consistent. In fact there was discussion post IDO whether we should focus on the game first and come back to casino later, or proceed as planned. In the end I’m glad we stuck to our roadmap, as the hybrid model will allow us to do so much more cross-chain with our game. Not to mention, we now have a working casino that will continue to profit as we grow, and will continue to expand it’s use case cross-chain and in game.

Much of the development has already begun for N.I.C.E. Invaders. We will be adding the gitbook in the next few weeks, but here’s a sneak peek at what’s been started in no particular order.

Construction and Upgrading of In Game Assets (not yet tokenized, early implementation)- Assets are used in the mining, building, upgrading, defense, and attack systems. Will be releasing more on these when gitbook releases. As players level up their assets, their mining rate increases.

Faction/Guild Systems (Initial systems in place)- Each planet will require all Invader types to mine, attack, and stay protected. Guilds can be formed to ward off other attackers, or to fight off Black Hodles. Tax rate, protection rate, and voting systems implemented.

Map Framework (early stages)- The map will start off consisting of 100 hundred planets, each of which will require an Emperor and staked $CRUSH to mine $NICE. While there are workarounds with player tribes combining their core leaders to act in place of an Emperor should the planet be unoccupied, the Emperor will always take precedence. Hint: Keep an eye out for Emperor NFTs as they are the rulers of the game.

Black Hodle Logic (early implementation)— Self spawning Black Hodles (Black Holes) spawn to consume resources and require teaming up to defeat.

Additional work done on the combat systems, world building, leveling/tiers and more.

Early Concept Art

We’re still in early stages, but a lot work has been done. Here’s the roadmap and what to expect. Please understand we’re still in discussion and locking down details, so this is all subject to change in the upcoming weeks, but here’s what we anticipate.

January- We will be starting to prepare and potentially launching the first round of out Initial NFT Offering. We will be potentially announcing a partner this next week if we come to an agreement. We’ve designed an NFT collection called “Mad N.I.C.E. Invaders” that is meant to exist on markets outside of the game. However players are incentivized to hodl by keeping the NFT and minted game character in the same wallet. We’re rewarding these “Crushed NFTs” as we’re calling them, with rewards from marketplace profits paid out in $CRUSH. The idea behind this uses our hybrid approach to allow the NFT holders to mint their in game character using their collection piece. This will allow the player to burn their game character and mint him again cross-chain (although he would lose any leveling). This could be useful in deciding to sell your NFT on the markets as it is the key to a character, so a rare NFT would allow access to a highly valuable in character. More info will be released on this as we roll out, and functionality is of course subject to change. All this is to say, the first round of the sale will be solely our most rare NFTs; the Emperor, which is needed for planets to mine $NICE. 100 planets, and 100 Emperors only.

We’re unsure at this point how many will be available for sale, but the priority for the sale will be -

Crush God NFT Holders Staking Pool 2.0 Stakers Public

The second round will include our next 3 most rare invaders, followed by the on going sale of the additional invader roles. We anticipate round one in January, and the other rounds in Feb and ongoing.

Additionally we are discussing a cross-chain IDO for $NICE starting with BSC and Fantom, being launched by a partner who will remain unnamed until it is official. N.I.C.E. Invaders is meant to be cross chain, which means we will need liquidity for both $NICE and $CRUSH on other chains. Additional funds will be used for marketing and increased development.

This will likely start late Jan into Feb. Priority will likely be the same as above.

In Feb/March we anticipate being able to mint your game characters, with the early market place opening up late Q1 and early gameplay in the beginning of Q2. We’ll also be looking for real estate offering and initial Invadervaerse rollout to start around this time as well.

Early Concept Art

In addition some other things to note.

First, expanding our game offerings outside of casino and into the MMO world allows us to expand marketing into more traditional channels, which should translate into increased exposure.

Second, our new team of game developers are much more experienced than the unfortunate team who dropped the ball with Dice Invaders. They have a lot of experience, as well as many delivered products to big name clients, and have been already moving forward solving the issues left behind by the other team. The reason our API works now is thanks to them. They’re also the ones fixing Dice Invaders and more. Because they are a much more well rounded team, starting in January we will be allowing users to join the development discord server to follow progress, get sneak peeks at art, help provide input, and more. Essentially the development process will become much more transparent, interactive, and effective.

I know this has been a long read, but there is so much to cover and so much going on right now.

We’re so excited for our new and existing path. A ton of work ahead but a lot of movement and excitement on the way.

The code can be found at github: https://github.com/Creepybits/BEP-20-contracts/blob/Master/SuperSale.sol

Once you have compiled the code without errors, you need to chose the SaleDeployer contract at the deployment page.

Name your coin, give it a symbol and provide the address where you want the currency from the purchases should be sent. Press transact.

Once you have confirmed the deployment in metamask you get a dropdown menu under “Deployed Contracts”. Reveal the address of the token as well as the sales contract by pressing on it’s respecive button.

Chose the Supercoin contract, copy the token_address and put it in the “At Address” text field and press the “At Address” button. Then chose the SuperSale contract, copy the token_sale_address and put it in the “At Address” text field and press the “At Address” button.

When you expand the SuperSale contract under deployed contracts, you can see the sales rate, token address, which address the currency from the sales will be sent to and amount of currency raised so far.

If you expand the Supercoin contract you also get various types of information. You can try to mint coins or add a new minter, but you will get error messages. You are no longer the owner of the contract, and only the sales contract is allowed to mint new coins. By putting the address of the sales contract in the “isMinter” box and press the button, you will get confirmation that the sales contract is the minter.

When you send currency (in this case BNB) to the sales contract, it will mint your coins and send it back to you. The picture below shows how I’m sending 0.05 BNB to the sales contract, the sales contract forwards the 0.05 BNB to the address we provided as the beneficiary when we first deployed the SaleDeployer contract, and finally 500 Super Coins is minted and sent to the address of the buyer.

If you wish to use another rate for your sales, you can change it almost all the way down at the bottom of the code. You change the “10000” to whichever rate you prefer.

SingularityDAO: End of Year Update 2021,"Greetings Singularitarians,

Wow, what a year! As a team, we at SingularityDAO would like to take this opportunity to thank you for all your support during 2021 and wish you all a Happy New Year. It has been such an amazing year and we could not have done it without all of you. From those of you who have been with us since day one, to people who are just now discovering us, thank you for everything.

With 2021 drawing to a close it seemed like the perfect time to reflect on everything that has happened over the past 12 months and what a 12 months it has been!

What is SingularityDAO?

SingularityDAO is a DeFi Protocol designed to remove the stress, fear and hassle currently associated with Decentralized Finance and Cryptocurrency. Our team are at the forefront of DeFi 2.0 and are already pushing hard towards 3.0 — The brain child of Ben Goertzel (CEO and Founder of SingularityNET) and Marcello Mari (CEO of SingularityDAO) SingularityDAO is taking the tools of traditional finance and rebuilding them for the blockchain. Using the Artificial Intelligence backbone that SingularityNET is building, we are creating advanced AI Algorithms capable of watching market sentiment, performing technical analysis, automatically rebalancing assets while also watching global economic events, politics, and many of factors to make well informed trading decisions in order to beat the market and generate profit. Our platform hosts a whole range of DeFi tools, but let’s begin by talking about our primary offering, non-custodial decentralized hedge funds, named DynaSets.

What are DynaSets?

A DynaSet is a dynamically managed set of assets. You can think of it somewhat like a basket of tokens automatically rebalanced by a combination of humans and AI, incredibly similar to a Hedge Fund in traditional finance.

For this example, let’s consider a DynaSet composed of USDC and BTC. If the indicators that our trading and AI team have set suggest to them that BTC is showing signs of a price increase, the trading team ‘DAM’ (Dynamic Asset Manager) of Humans and/or Artificial Intelligences then exchanges USDC for BTC. They then wait for BTC to reach a target price point, before swapping it back into USDC thereby generating “Alpha”.

January to April

During these first few months of the year SingularityDAO was a team of just 5 people planning and making acquaintances. Marcello, Mario our CFO and Jerome, one of our lead Developers, along with Ben were busy brainstorming what has now become the SingularityDAO Platform and all things included.

While Jerome was hard at work laying the foundations for all that has since then been built and making sure we had a project to launch, Marcello and Mario were racing around meeting potential investors and partners to ensure that the launch happened.

May

All the hard work of the previous few months came to fruition in May when we held our Governance Generation Event and the SDAO token was released into the world. At that same time we began to Airdrop 5% of our total supply to SingularityNET’s AGIX holding community.

For a team of only 5 people it was a massive achievement to do all this, but also incredibly hard work so hiring went into overdrive and the team started to grow.

Around this time SingularityDAO also won “DeFi Project of the Year” at AIBC (Artificial Intelligence Blockchain Conference) in Dubai.

June

With our team expanding rapidly we were able to move forward with creation of the SingularityDAO Platform and in June invited volunteers from our community to beta test the platform.

A massive shout out to all our community beta testers for such helpful and well considered feedback regarding the platform beta and many more things since.

July

Beta testing was under way, the development team was hard at work preparing the platform and our CEO Marcello Mari was being interviewed by CNN! After only 3 months since the project launched we were featured in not one but two CNN pieces airing on global TV.

Alongside this we were fortunate enough to have caught the attention of Gate.io who decided to list the SDAO token on their platform and of course while all of this was going on, we were still hiring!

August

August was a huge month for us, it marked the end of our Airdrop which saw the last of 5 million SDAO tokens distributed to AGIX holders.

We launched the open beta of the SingularityDAO platform, which you are all currently using to swap, provide liquidity, yield farm, stake SDAO, stake NuNet and even watch your DynaSets trade!

Not only that but August was the month that Chris Poulin our CTO officially joined the team and all of this was topped off with an announcement of a partnership with NuNet.

September

Bonded Staking began in September and our TVL sky rocketed to over 50% of our circulating supply being locked within our platform. Since then it has never dropped below that number.

Thanks again to everyone for showing such confidence in what we are doing and supporting it from day 1.

Alongside the launch of Epoch 1 and Bonded Staking, we of course continued development and hiring. By this point that team of 5 from the start of the year was closer to 35!

October

October was a special month for the SingularityDAO team, almost every single team member made the trip from all corners of the world to meet up in France for 5 days. What was previously a group of strangers working on a DeFi project became a group of friends and colleagues working collaboratively to make a shared dream come to life. Work was done, presentations were made, projects were planned, workshops were held, food was eaten and wine was drunk! A true team was formed.

Of course that’s not all, we began our relationship with Hacken who now handle all of security and audits and have truly been a wonderful partner to us.

Epoch 1 also rolled over in Epoch 2 at this time and even more people placed their trust in SingularityDAO and staked their tokens.

November

Another special month, this time for both SingularityDAO and the SingularityNET Ecosystem as a whole. NuNet was launched from our freshly released Launchpad. 2 million dollars was contributed in just 90 seconds.

What an amazing result and with that, NuNet, the second spin-off and third member of the Ecosystem was born.

We didn’t stop there though, we also launched the SDAO token on Binance Smart Chain and opened SDAO/BNB and SDAO/BUSD pools on Pancake Swap.

December

It probably won’t surprise you to hear that December was a special month for SingularityDAO, the truth is, every month in 2021 was special for one reason or another, we have been truly blessed to have such a great project, team and community.

December really was extra special though and ended the year with a bang! We opened the month with our Advent Calendar and invited the whole community to apply to join the beta test of DynaSets. We onboarded a few very special influencers too, some of which have already begun putting out content with much more to follow.

We launched staking, yield farming and our own bridge for Binance Smart Chain. The DynaSet beta began with the launch of dynSING (SDAO/NTX/AGIX/USDC), dynBTC (BTC/USDC) and dynETH (ETH/USDC) and around 3 million dollars was contributed to aid in the testing. Once again thank you all for placing such faith in the products we are developing.

December really was a busy month though, because not only did we announce a partnership with SoftServe to assist us in refining and strengthening our platform ready for deep AI integration in the New Year, we also won the PancakeSwap auction which enabled people to stake SDAO and earn CAKE.

This barely scrapes the surface of all that happened in December, so let’s close this off with a quick list of cool reveals:

Closing thoughts from Marcello Mari, SingularityDAO CEO

2021 has been one of the most incredible years for me personally and professionally as a founder bringing to life the initial vision of SingularityDAO as imagined by Ben Goertzel and myself in the fall of 2020.

We achieved so much especially thanks to an outstanding team of talents that have joined the initial team of founders and, of course, you, our community!

A special thanks also goes to the SingularityNET Foundation for the consistent and ongoing support in all that we do.

Without all of you this would have not been possible.

With this in mind we look forward to 2022, the year in which we’ll build and launch more DynaSets and more products. We’ll build and train more machine learning, sign new partnerships, hire more people and bring SingularityDAO to the success it deserves!

$Super explained — The PaymentSplitter,"Super is a scam. Do not invest.

In a previous story I introduced you to the contract code of $Super, a relatively new contract on the binance smart chain. Today i want to have a look at the PaymentSplitter contract within the super contract.

Recap

$Super is a relatively new contract on the binance smart chain. It was created 14th December 2021. A first introduction into $Super can be found here and here. Be aware, especially the second story has the typical crypto marketing speech (“hidden gem”, “game-changing”, successive questions, …), but I refer them nevertheless because you will not find $super like other defi projects in every other story.

So, you got first impressions, let us now go straight to the contract and have a look at the code. You can find the token here and the corresponding contract here. I will give a overview over the contract code in this story and will maybe dig deeper within a follow up story.

What does the PaymentSplitter do?

The PaymentSplitter is a contract which pays out the balance of the contract or token balance of the contract to defined payees depending on their internally managed shares.

Currently, the $Super token contracts is holder of 237.645459642783184903 BNB (At the moment $124,248.18 (@ $522.83/BNB), 30 December 2021).

At creation time 2 payees (payee zero and payee one) where defined. Each of them are holding 50 shares (total shares are 100). No payee received any payment yet. Payee zero is also the address of the distribution pool and its balance is 153.975 BNB ($80,296.40 (@ $521.49/BNB), 30 December 2021). Until a few days ago this adress received its BNB from the super contract itself. Now it receives it from the 2 contracts you approve within the super web application (Heroes tier and villians tier) to create nodes.

The values are stored in BNB (Not in $Super). So, the developers have made $204,927.18 ($80,296.40 + $124,630.78) within 2 weeks which is a nice revenue. I guess I should playing with the idea to create a similar contract by myself. By the way, there is also a futurUsePool (sic!) with around 42.14 BNB ($21,886.94 (@ $519.36/BNB), 30.12.2021).

Should the developers — if they are scammers — withdraw it?

Simple no. It is stored in BNB and therefore it does not depends on the value of the token itself. If they withdraw it, user could get anxious. Just doing nothing is the best options for scammers. Once super does not earn any money anymore, they can come and get it.

Should the developers — if they are not scammers — withdraw it?

Maybe. But they have to communicate. They need to explain to its users what this money is for and what are they planning to do with it. In my opinion they have to find a valid use case for $Super. At the moment it is just a stock market game with one stock and extra rules. With no valid use case and if the developers are not scammers themself it stays a scam for every user who is not net positive — for every new user or for a user who bought in high. Until then, the net positve users are stealing the new ones merciless (especially if they advertise it)

How does the PaymentSplitter work?

So, you know already the developers have made around $200,000 within a little bit more than 2 weeks. Just out of curiosity lets have finally a look at the contract.

The code of the PaymentSplitter is from OpenZeppelin Contracts v4.3.2

The contract PaymentSplitter extends from the contract Context, which just provides the basic functions _msgSender and _msgData to access msg.sender and msg.data indirectly.

On creation (which happened during the creation of the Super contract) it receives payees and its corresponding shares calls the private function _addPayee which adds the payee with its share to the contract.

There are a few public read functions to get information about the total shares and total released, about the payees, and to get the shares and the released of a specific account (payee) and the coin BNB or a specific token.

The central write function is release, which sends BNB or a any other token to the provided address, if it is a payee. This function is not protected by any modifier to protect it from a call which is not the payee itself or the owner. Anyone can execute it (But it gets payed to one of the payee, not to your own address). By the developers of OpenZeppelin it is marked as virtual, so it can (and in my opinion should) be overwritten to by the inheriting contract to protect it from misuse. I do not think that the payees wants that anyone can trigger the release of the contract balance or the tokens within the contract.

Next Time

Next time I will have a look at the $Super contract itself and the contract NODERewardManagement.

Until then,

all the best to you.

Distribution of your coin (part 2),"So you’ve made your own cryptocurrency and created a faucet that gives a small amount of currency to anyone who claims it. Let’s give people an opportunity to buy larger quantities of your coin.

Can’t read the full article? Become a member of Medium here

There are many ways to let others purchase your coin, the easiest way is to simply put it up for sale at a DEX such as PancakeSwap. The downside with using a DEX service is that you have to put in as much liquidity as the total sum of all the coins you wish to sell.

For example, lets assume you wish to sell 10 000 of your coins and you set the price at 0.001 BNB per coin. You will have to list the 10 000 of your coins together with 10 000 x 0.001 BNB in order to activate trading. That means you have to lock 10 BNB (roughly $5500 USD at the time of writing this), and you might not have that amount of money at the time.

Instead you can write a smart contract which allows people to purchase your coin directly from the contract itself. Contracts like these are often called crowdsale contract or selfdrop contract.

I’m not going to write all of the code here, but you can find it at github: https://github.com/Creepybits/BEP-20-contracts/blob/Master/selfdrop.sol

Open Remix and create a new file called selfdrop.sol. Copy the code from github, paste it in Remix and compile.

At the deploy screen chose “injected web3”, rate (price of the coin), wallet (the address of the wallet that you wish the BNB/ETH recieved from the sale should be sent to) and the contract address of your coin. Also make sure that the contract you are deploying is the correct one.

When you are happy with the settings, press “transact” and confirm in Metamask. You will get some confirmation info at the bottom of the screen. Copy the hash and paste it in the blockchain explorer you used to deploy the contract.

When you check your contract and wish to verify it, as explained in previous posts, you will get a message saying that you need to change the constructor values.

The correct numbers will be found when you check the transaction of the deployment of the contract. Copy those numbers and replace the ones in the verifyingprocess.

After this there shouldn’t be a problem to verify the contract.

Now you have to transfer the coins you wish to sell to the contract. I sent 10 000 ZannoMoney that I wish to sell to the contract.

Next up we will try to buy some coins by sending BNB to the contract.

I sent 0.1 BNB from another address that I use for testing, and the contract sent me back 1000 ZannoMoney (ZMO) as well as forwarding the 0.1 BNB to the address I specified when deploying the contract.

The “Rate” you put in when deploying the contract decides at which price people can buy your coin. A rate of 10000 means that one of your coin will cost 0.0001 BNB (or ETH if you deploy it at Ethereum blockchain).

Now you have created a cryptocurremcy of your own, written a faucet contract as a way of distribution and finally written a contract for crowdselling your coin.

$100 to $5.5mil in 4 Years — A Complete Beginners Guide to Crypto,"If it shows you only Fiat currencies and not crypto, select Withdraw Crypto on the right hand side. You can now select BNB as the coin you want to transfer, and then enter your address. Note that I can not enter the address directly (as shown below) as I have security settings to only allow whitelisted addresses from my address book. I recommend you enable this (via Binance account security settings) as it prevents someone who gains access to your account from easily withdrawing your money.

Withdrawing Crypto to Binance Smart Chain

After you enter your MetaMask BSC address (that we copied from MetaMask) the page will then it will realise it is a BSC address and Binance will ask you a couple of questions. It is important to note that:

Yes, the MetaMask address you have copied from MetaMask does support the Binance Smart Chain (as long as you followed the add BSC to MetaMask instructions above)

the MetaMask address you have copied from MetaMask does support the Binance Smart Chain (as long as you followed the add BSC to MetaMask instructions above) If you enter the wrong address your money will be lost. This goes for much in the cryptocurrency space, always check the address and network before committing to any transfer.

This goes for much in the cryptocurrency space, always check the address and network before committing to any transfer. Binance Smart Chain uses the BEP20 token standard, you don’t yet need to know what this means technically except that it is not directly compatible with other networks such as Ethereum — hence the above warnings about the wrong network.

If you answer the above questions correctly, then Binance will allow you to transfer the funds. Enter your desired amount in the Withdraw Amount box (note that this is in BNB, not your native Fiat currency — if you just want to transfer what you converted earlier, then select max). Depending on your security settings you may be asked some confirmation codes, I have two-factor authentication, and email codes turned on so I have to enter these every time I transfer — it is annoying, but think of how much more annoying it is for someone trying to steal your money.

You can track the progress of the transfer, and once it appears in your MetaMask wallet you are ready to proceed to the next phase. You can see in my screenshot below I now have the 0.28 BNB (approx $200 AUD) that we began with but in our crypto DeFi wallet.

BNB in MetaMask Ready to DeFi

Gas Fees

You will see and hear the term gas fees, while the background behind these can be complex depending on the network protocol in use you can simply think of them as bank transfer fees. Any time you move crypto around you need to pay a transfer fee, and the fee currency for BSC is the BNB coin — hence we used our initial transfer as BNB so we had gas fees immediately. If you happened to use another currency or an exchange that did not support BNB then you will not have any BNB to cover gas to accomplish anything. The crypto world did think of this and provides faucets which you can get a tiny amount of the relevant gas currency for free to get you started. The BNB faucet is at this link, note that you can only use this function every 24hrs, so make sure your first transfer is into more BNB, if you need to transfer between currencies use pancakeswap.finance, they are the primary exchange on BSC.

Binance Smart Chain Faucet

Phase 4 — Dripping Crypto

Now that you are ready to explore the world of DeFi, it can become easy to forget where you put money (yep, I’m serious) and also to find your way onto scam or poorly run sites. I recommend Apeboard.finance to track your accounts, but also I tend to use sites that are on their protocol list as they have at least seen some moderate trading volume and have some level of legitimacy. When you enter their site you can input your MetaMask address and then it will search the public blockchains and tell you what currencies you have (as shown below, with their Christmas theme active, note the AUD amount varies slightly based on currency rate changes between the screenshots — change the currency to your native currency in their settings).

Apeboard.finance — DeFi Dashboard showing our Example $200 AUD

We are about to get into investing our crypto, it is important to note that the demonstrated investment I provide below is just and example of what is possible in DeFi; you can do other amazing things such as coin farming or invest in stablecoins at interest rates like 20% per year (think of how that compares to your normal bank account). You are obviously free to jump into the deep end and find further opportunities, and again what I provide here is not financial advice, its just a guide. I recommend sticking to the Binance Smart Chain initially, as Ethereum gas fees are ridiculous at the moment. There are also many other networks to explore (which can be seen in the above screenshot), but that is well outside the scope of this article.

Drip Network

The recommended example is the Drip Network which is a project offering a 1% return on investments, daily, up to a maximum of 365%. The details behind Drip are detailed in their whitepaper, but I will attempt to cover the highlights here.

Drip utilises what is referred to as tokenomics, which means that the developer has aimed to design factors into the token to ensure longevity and price stability based on their token goals. While the tokenomics term does get thrown around a bit in the DeFi space it at least indicates an attempt to maintain the project as a long term investment.

In the case of Drip, the tokenomics include a 10% tax on every transaction, and these funds are fed into the Drip contract (think Drip money bucket) to pay investors. The caveat here is that if you compound your investment (or hydrate in drip terminology) then there is only a 5% fee.

What the Drip tokenomics does is embrace the power of compound interest, and in the absence of fancy calculations and diagrams I present this link to a fantastic Drip Calculator by Kelly Snook, who also has an excellent article on the details behind Drip strategy which I highly recommend to select your preferred strategy. This compound interest calculating is where this article headline comes from, by entering 1 wallet with 1 drip (current price approx $100 AUD), then we get $5.5 million dollars in 4 years and more if the price of drip increases. That is the power of daily compound interest.

Note I only put $100 in so we have spare BNB for future transaction gas fees, and if you run low in the future, sell some drip into BNB which we will detail soon. The amount you enter into your Drip initially does not significantly affect the amount you earn overall, it just means if you put in more you get more out sooner.

Example Drip Calculation for 1 Drip wallet with 1 Drip

Now, it is important to mention that some people consider Drip to be a ponzi scheme since you need to be invited to join the network. Dr. Chris does a great job at dispelling this concern in this article and while Drip is not without risk, it is indeed (at least in my experience) well worth the investment. Additionally, the liquidity of Drip is being supported by The Manor Farm, a project created by Drip’s founder, which is further supporting the Drip ecosystem.

Depositing Drip

We now have the what covered so lets move on to the how; using the browser you have MetaMask installed go to the Drip website, and select Swap at the top of the page and then Connect Wallet at the top right corner.",https://cryptozoa.com/100-to-5-5-million-in-4-years-a-complete-beginners-guide-to-crypto-1a420fe720a3,['Allissa Auld'],2022-01-01 17:44:05.779000+00:00,"['Cryptocurrency', 'Defi', 'Finance', 'Binance Smart Chain', 'Drip']"
Create Your Own Mintable Token,"Besides making a regular coin as we went through in an earlier post, there’s also the possibility to create a coin which doesn’t have a set supply. A mintable token is just a token that you can create more of, either as the owner of the contract or in an automated manner.

Can’t read the full article? Become a member of Medium here

The coin we are creating is going to be mintable by the person or the persons who have been assigned the minter role. The contract will leave the ownership to whichever address deploys it, and from there the owner can assign or revoke minter roles to other people.

As usual, you can copy the code directly from github.

At the deployment screen insert the name, symbol and initial supply for the token (remember that we have 18 decimals, so you need to put in your supply followed by 18 zeros). When you are satisfied, press “transact” and confirm in metamask.

Check the bottom of the screen for information related to the deployment, copy the hash and search for it in whichever blockchain you deployed the contract on.

When you check the contract in the blockchain explorer, you will once again have to verify the contract before you can interact with it. Press “verify and publish”.

The verification of the contract works as with the previous contracts. Put the correct compiler and license information when promted, and at the next page paste the source code in the designated area and finally copy the highlighted code and paste it in the field for constructor argument.

If you did everything correctly the contract will be verified and you can connect your metamask. Once you have connected with metamask (using the same address as you deployed the contract with), you have the option to add more minters.

This new minter (as well as the owner) can now create coins which will be sent to the specified address. And again, you have to add as many zeros as there is decimals. So when I mint 10 000 coins to an address, I have to write “10000000000000000000000” for it to be correct.

Once you have minted coins, the coin and its ticker will show up at the contract address.

RisingSun Is Becoming Samurai Legends!,"RisingSun ($RSUN) launched in July 2021 as a community-focused buyback token. Since then, we’ve grown tremendously as a project and a community. The release of Samurai Rising and Samurai Lands cemented our transformation into a fully-fledged GameFi ecosystem. We’ve had our ups and downs, yet have loved every moment and can’t wait for what the future holds.

To come through on our December promise to take our project to the next level, we’re relaunching as Samurai Legends! Crypto Gaming United (CGU) has recently committed to onboarding 25,000 players and funding our project significantly! We believe this fresh image and significant backing will bring us to new heights. None of our products or goals are going anywhere, and neither are we.

It’s easy to forget that $RSUN didn’t launch as a play-to-earn token. As a result, $RSUN’s current tokenomics pose significant risks and challenges for the sustainability of our ecosystem. For example, most GameFi projects launch with approximately 50% of the supply allocated to rewards, while RisingSun launched with 0%. For this reason, we’re migrating $RSUN to a new primary token called Samurai Legends ($SMG). This migration ensures that our project can support a massive player base and thrive for years to come.

You can deposit your $RSUN and $INF tokens to withdraw $SMG later via the migration dashboard: https://migrate.risingsun.finance/

We’ve planned the migration for weeks to prepare for a smooth and successful transition. Exchange rates have been fixed at 1 $SMG for 100 $RSUN and 1 $SMG for 12.5 $INF (8 $RSUN =1 $INF). It is no longer be possible to buy or sell $RSUN. Migration will remain possible at any time.

January will see an extensive marketing campaign for the launch of Samurai Legends. In late January, we will launch on multiple IDOs with full backing from CGU. It is worth reiterating that we truly believe this relaunch will take our project to new heights. We want to thank everyone who stuck with us and believed in us as a team. We can’t wait for the good times ahead! Please refer to the FAQ below for any unanswered questions.

Frequently Asked Questions

What happens to my $RSUN and $INF tokens?

You can deposit your $RSUN and $INF in the migration dashboard. When Samurai Legends launches, you will receive $SMG equivalent to your deposited amount +10%. The USD value of 1 $SMG will be determined when $RSUN buys are blocked. Thus, your $RSUN value will be set at that time +10%.

Are my tokens ($RSUN, $INF) and NFTs safe?

Yes. All assets will retain their value throughout the migration process. $RSUN and $INF are the only assets that require user attention via the migration dashboard.

How do I receive my $SMG tokens?

You can receive your $SMG tokens using the migration dashboard. $SMG has a vesting period of 1 month, with more tokens becoming available to claim every hour. This means that you will be able to claim your total amount one month after relaunch.

Why are $RSUN buys & sells blocked?

We have blocked $RSUN buys & sells to avoid confusion and ensure the best relaunch possible.

Can I still earn $INF playing SamuraiRising?

Yes, although the ability to swap $INF to $RSUN will be disabled. This means that players cannot cash out $INF from December 31st until the launch of Samurai Legends. $INF earnings can be deposited in the migration dashboard to receive $SMG at any time.

Can I still purchase land NFTs and recruit samurai?

Yes. We will temporarily remove the $RSUN cost for land NFTs and samurai recruitment. The additional costs will be temporarily increased to account for the removed $RSUN.

What happens to my staked $RSUN/$INF tokens?

$RSUN energy staking and $INF reward multiplier staking have its one-week withdrawal period set to 0. $RSUN solo staking cannot be unlocked until the original period ends but can be swapped for $SMG once unlocked on the migration dashboard.

Can I still earn while waiting for the relaunch?

Yes. You can still play SamuraiRising and earn $INF during the relaunch process.

What does this mean for managers and scholars?

Samurai Rising players won’t be able to sell their $INF earnings from December 31st until the Samurai Legends relaunch in late January. Instead, players can deposit their earnings into the migration dashboard and receive $SMG tokens. See this article for full instructions for managers.

When is the relaunch?

We are aiming to relaunch at the end of January on multiple IDOs. Stay tuned for more information on how to participate in the pre-sale.

What are the tokenomics for $SMG?

You can read a complete overview of $SMG’s tokenomics and distribution here.

What will happen to NFT reflections for generals?

With no buy or sell taxes, generals will lose $BUSD reflections. Instead, we’re committing to making generals a prominent part of Samurai Lands. They’ll receive a significant bump in governance voting power in the short term.

Will Samurai Legends have a dual-token economy?

Yes. Like RisingSun, Samurai Legends will have a dual-token economy with $SMG and a new side token called $KOKU. It will launch alongside $SMG and will be revealed in future posts.

Is the project staying on Binance Smart Chain?

Yes. We have considered different chains but believe that GameFi projects have a bright future ahead on Binance Smart Chain.

What will happen to BananaKatana?

BananaKatana will remain playable, but rewards have ceased from today onward.

Will the roadmap change?

With the additional backing that this relaunch brings, we can fully commit to our ideal roadmap and double down on our goal to become a mainstay of the GameFi space.

Wen special crates?

We’ve heard your cries! Special crate unboxing will be our top priority after a successful relaunch. In the meantime, special crates will contribute to energy as a tier 1 samurai card.",https://medium.com/samurailegends/risingsun-is-becoming-samurai-legends-c01673375254,[],2022-01-28 20:51:31.171000+00:00,"['Cryptocurrency', 'Gamefi', 'Playtoearn', 'Binance Smart Chain', 'Nft']"
Danny Bibi of AdMedia Discusses Contextual Targeting Advertising,"Danny Bibi, head of AdMedia of Los Angeles, California, believes relevant advertising is important for business owners. It can be difficult to reach your target audience with the correct message, so contextual targeting advertising helps provide relevant ads specifically designed for you and your customers’ needs.

Contextual targeting advertising allows advertisers to use data about an individual. Things like location, browsing habits, and other factors provide them with more targeted advertisements than ever before. The result? Relevant ads that are better suited for the customer instead of generic ones.

Contextual Targeting Advertising is a form of internet advertising that targets ads based on viewed content. It works by identifying the website someone is viewing and matching it to an advertiser who wants their ad displayed there. This type of advertising has grown in popularity because it provides relevant ads for consumers, which increases the effectiveness of advertisements.

Contextual targeting provides advertisers with more accurate data about their target market to reach out to them more effectively. The information gathered from contextual targeting also helps marketers learn what products or services are most popular among their customers to cater to future campaigns better to suit consumer tastes. Contextual targeting also allows advertisers to show ads before consumers even click on a link or visit a new website.

How does Contextual Technology Work

Contextual targeting technology is used to match ads with the content of a web page. It works by identifying the website someone is viewing and then looking for keywords or phrases related to an advertiser’s products or services. Once a match is found, the advertiser’s ad will be displayed on the relevant web page.

Danny Bibi, head of AdMedia, believes that contextual targeting has grown in popularity because it allows advertisers to place their ads in front of people interested in what they have to offer. It also helps ensure that ads are relevant to consumers’ views online, increasing their effectiveness. Additionally, contextual targeting allows marketers to collect data about their target market to understand better what types of products or services interest them.

What Types of Data Does Conceptual Technology Look At

Contextual targeting uses data about an individual’s location, browsing habits, and other factors to provide them with relevant advertisements. It collects information like IP addresses, geographical locations, browser history, images, text, and audio to piece together a general idea of the most relevant ads for the consumer. Danny Bibi believes that this allows advertisers to create better-targeted campaigns that are more likely to generate interest among their target audience. Consumers often welcome relevant ads because they are tailored specifically for them; this makes contextual advertising effective overall.

What is Customer Match

Customer match is one of the many features marketers use to get the most out of their contextual targeting campaign. It allows businesses to upload a customer email list to target these individuals with relevant ads. With Customer Match, companies like AdMedia can upload lists of emails or phone numbers so you can target your ad to people who have already purchased with you.

Customer match is a valuable tool because it allows you to target people who are already interested in your product or service. It also helps build customer loyalty, as they are more likely to be receptive to your ads because they have already bought from you before.

This helps ensure that ads are relevant to what consumers view online, increasing their effectiveness. Additionally, contextual targeting allows marketers to collect data about their target market to understand better what types of products or services interest them.

Final Thoughts

Using the features provided by the contextual advertising system, marketers can make a relevant ad much more likely to be seen and clicked. By collecting data about an individual’s location, browsing habits, and other factors, advertisers can create better-targeted campaigns that reach people interested in what they have to offer.

"Danny Bibi, Head of AdMedia, Discusses Contextual Targeting Advertising","Most companies have data that they don’t use effectively. Danny Bibi of AdMedia in Los Angeles, California, believes that businesses are so focused on productivity, efficiency, and profit margins that they forget to invest in relationships with their customers.

This is a mistake for many reasons: you can’t grow your customer base or increase sales without this investment. It also means you are missing out on the opportunity to create lasting impressions of your brand through targeted offers and personalized messages sent at just the right time.

These investments bring in more revenue and keep customers coming

back again and again because they feel appreciated by your business. Contextual technology offers a solution to these issues by making it easier than ever before for businesses to communicate with their clients using personalized content delivered when and where it’s most relevant.

What is Contextual Technology

Contextual technology is a term used to describe the various methods of collecting and analyzing data to determine the most relevant context for delivering content or messaging. This can be done in several ways, but the goal is always to present information useful and engaging for the customer. Danny Bibi of AdMedia feels that if you know that a customer has just viewed a product on your website, AdMedia might send them an offer for that product or a related item as they leave your site.

Advantages

Danny Bibi of AdMedia believes that one of the biggest advantages of contextual technology is that businesses can target customers based on their location. This means you can send them messages when they are near your store, for example, or when they are looking for a specific product. It also makes it possible to personalize messages based on customer preferences, which helps to create a better customer experience.

Businesses can also use contextual technology to track customer behavior to make more informed decisions about what content to present. This helps businesses understand how customers interact with their brand and what content will likely result in a sale.

What Can Contextual Technology Be Used For

Businesses can use contextual technology in nearly every industry. For example, suppose you own a restaurant. In that case, you might use contextual technology to send someone who has viewed your menu on their mobile device an offer for a free appetizer when they visit your restaurant during off-peak hours. If you run a hotel, this type of technology might let you send someone who views the rates page on your website an offer for a lower price.

Contextual technology also provides B2B interactions, partnerships, and consumer interactions. You could use it to work with partners or clients who share similar client bases to create targeted promotions and maximize revenue.

Danny Bibi, head of AdMedia, feels that companies can use contextual technology to improve customer relationships. Ultimately, the goal is to create an immersive customer experience that results in more sales and a better reputation for your business.

Contextual Advertising

Contextual Targeting Advertising is a form of online advertising that uses contextual data to target ads specifically to that user. It is a type of targeted advertising, online advertising that allows advertisers to target their ads to specific users.

The purpose of contextual targeting advertising is to place relevant ads in front of the right people at the right time. For example, if you are a business that sells cars, you might use contextual advertising to show ads for your cars to people who have recently visited automotive websites.

The way contextual targeting advertising works is by using the contextual data of the user to decide which ads to show them. This data can come from many sources, such as the user’s location, interests, or activities.

Contextual targeting advertising is often used in combination with targeted advertising. Together, they make up a form of online advertising known as programmatic advertising.

"Danny Bibi, AdMedia CEO, Discusses How Contextual Targeting Advertising Works","At its core, contextual targeting matches things that are not explicitly stated to things that are. Using an example of “shoes,” the outside viewer would see it as something people put on their feet. Danny Bibi, head of AdMedia of Los Angeles, California, understands that they might even assume there’s some additional context, like the color of the shoes or for whom they’re being bought.

But how do computers know so much? Well, it’s quite simple. You start with a word cloud of all the words associated with your business and then use statistical analysis to determine which ones are most likely to appear together in writing about your products or services. For example, if your company sells clothes, shoes might show up in informative articles about fashion trends along with other words like purses and makeup. It doesn’t stop there, though. Contextual targeting goes a step further to discover how these words are used together.

For example, if someone is interested in fashion, you want to find them wherever they’re looking for it online. They might be reading an article about the latest trends or watching a tutorial on applying different types of makeup. Either way, your ad could appear next to that content because the algorithms know this person is interested in fashion and makeup by matching their search or web history with patterns based on existing clients’ interests.

What is Contextual Targeting Advertising

Danny Bibi understands that contextual targeting advertising is a form of online advertising that uses information about what a person is doing on the web to show them ads for products and services relevant to their current activity.

Contextual Targeting Vs. Behavioral Targeting

There’s a big difference between contextual targeting advertising and behavioral targeting. Behavioral targeting is all about tracking what people have done in the past to create targeted ads in the present. For example, if you’ve recently visited a website about cars, you might start seeing car ads everywhere you go online. On the other hand, contextual targeting looks at what people are doing to show them related ads.

So which is better? Danny Bibi, head of AdMedia, believes that the answer is both! Contextual targeting advertising is great for showing people ads for products they might be interested in based on their current activity. Behavioral targeting is great for reminding people about products they’ve shown an interest in before. Together, they can create powerful advertising that reaches more consumers and drives more conversions.

How does Contextual Targeting work?

Contextual targeting works by analyzing all the words associated with a business and then determining which ones are most likely to appear together in writing about that business’s products or services. AdMedia then uses this information to place ads next to content related to the business somehow.

Why is Contextual Targeting important?

Contextual targeting is important because it allows businesses to place their ads in front of people who are already interested in what they have to offer. This means that businesses can save money by not wasting ad dollars on people not interested in their products or services.

Exclusivity

Unlike other platforms like Facebook, where almost anyone can target ads at specific groups of people, contextual advertising targets individual consumers based on their specific interests. This makes it an extremely exclusive way to market products and services because it’s nearly impossible to find a list of all the interests of all the people who use the internet.

Personalized Ads

Because contextual targeting uses information about what a person is doing on the web, it can create personalized ads relevant to them. This means that people are more likely to click on ads that appeal to them, leading to more conversions and a higher ROI. This means that people are more likely to click on ads and ultimately buy the offered products or services.

Targeting Niche Markets

Contextual advertising also allows businesses to target niche markets that they wouldn’t be able to reach with other forms of advertising. By understanding the interests of their target market, businesses can place their ads in front of people who are already interested in what they have to offer. This means that businesses can save money by not wasting ad dollars on people interested in their products or services.

Localized Content

Content is often localized with contextual targeting. This means that businesses can reach people based on their location, especially local or small businesses.

Contextual targeting has a much higher Return On Investment than other platforms like Facebook, where almost anyone can target ads at specific groups of people. Since contextual advertising targets individual consumers based on their specific interests, it allows advertisers to create personalized ads that are more likely to get clicked and lead to conversions. This means they’re more likely to see a return on their advertising dollars.

More Control

Because contextual targeting allows advertisers to place ads next to content related to the business, they have more control over where and how often those ads appear.

Final Thoughts

Contextual targeting is a powerful way for businesses to connect with people already interested in what they offer. By knowing what someone is searching, reading, watching, or sharing online, contextual advertising makes it easy for marketers to place ads next to valuable content relevant to their business. This increases the likelihood of getting more clicks and ultimately drives more conversions than other forms of advertising.",https://medium.com/@ad-media/danny-bibi-admedia-ceo-discusses-how-contextual-targeting-advertising-works-de4b0907b88c,[],2022-01-03 16:53:06.108000+00:00,"['Marketing', 'Digital Marketing', 'Los Angeles', 'Advertising', 'Digital Marketing Agency']"
Pub/Sub Messaging With Geo Data App Blueprint,"One of the many specialties of Backendless Database that other no-code solutions lack is the ability to work with location-based, or geospatial, data. With UI Builder, as in our GEO chat app template, you can easily implement location-based features, including your own Google Maps.

The GEO Chat App Blueprint is one of our earliest and simplest blueprints, but the functionality it showcases is extremely powerful. If you are looking to implement location-based or pub/sub messaging functions into your app, this template is great tool to learn how they work.

App Blueprints are more than just templates from which to build a specific type of application or website. We design all of our App Blueprints to provide one or more key functions that a developer would want to add to their application, regardless of the app’s business use.

The GEO Chat App Blueprint showcases how to acquire a user’s location (with their permission) and display that location on a Google Map component in UI Builder when the user posts a message. Users can see where other users posted their messages from as well.

As with all of our App Blueprints, the entirety of this app blueprint was built without code using Backendless’ UI Builder.

What Does the GEO Chat App Do?

You can view the demo of the GEO Chat App Blueprint here.

The GEO Chat app is a basic group chat. Users can create an account simply by logging in. The app does not use a traditional signup page; rather, a user signs in with a username and password. If that username does not already exist, a new account is automatically created and the user is logged in.

When a user posts a message, the app places a pin on the map component showing where the message originated. Simultaneously, the app displays the message in the chat sidebar for all online users.

The app also users a real-time listener to display to other users that a message is being typed. On the Users list sidebar, a ... bubble will appear next to a user that is actively typing a message.

Next, we’ll break down how these features are implemented.

Location Gathering and Sending a Message

When the chat page opens, the app collects the user’s location (with the user’s permission). This information is stored in app data, not the database, meaning that the app is not collecting user location data permanently. Of course, if you choose to use similar logic in your app, you can store that data, but you will need to comply with data privacy laws.

When a user submits a chat, this location information is used to pin their message on the map at their location.

The logic used to post the chat utilizes the Pub/Sub Messaging API Codeless block to share the message with all other users that are logged in.

Without adding additional parameters, such as repeatEvery and repeatExpiresAt , pub/sub messages automatically expire in Backendless after just a few minutes. Thus, if you want to store the messages, you will need to add additional parameters to the API service displayed above.

You can view non-expired messages by visiting the messaging console in the Backend portion of your Backendless Console.

You can also manually post messages using this console.

Listening for and Displaying Messages on the Google Map Component

The Workspace container block in UI Builder contains the logic for displaying published pub/sub messages on the map and side panel. To view the logic we'll be discussing, click on the puzzle icon.

The real-time message listener, below, is triggered when a new pub/sub message is posted. The listener takes the message’s JSON format and uses it to create a list. The data in this list are then used to populate the chat sidebar as well as the Google Map component on the page.

Simple Registration and Sign In

The GEO Chat app uses a simple mechanism to allow users to register or login on the same screen.

Rather than having separate login and registration pages, when a user submits their login credentials, the app checks if the user account exists before logging in. If no account exists, a new user is automatically created.

To do this, the app runs two functions concurrently.

The register function is attempted first:

If the username does not already exist, a new user is created with the user’s credentials. Those credentials are then used to login the user.

Finally, once the user is logged in, the app navigates to the chat page.

Closing

The GEO Chat App Blueprint showcases how to implement geospatial data and messaging in a UI Builder app. Most importantly, it provides you with a template to follow for a variety of key Backendless functions. Backendless offers tons of tutorials that you can access for free to learn how more about these powerful functions.

Person-to-person messaging

The Chat App Blueprint has a sleek and simple chat app design. Users are able to create an account, search through contacts, send and receive messages, and toggle between light and dark mode.

Sending a chat message is using a single form built in UI Builder. In fact, the same form and logic is used for both 1-to-1 chat and group chat. The logic that processes the message determines whether the message is to a single user or to a group, and adjusts accordingly.

Let’s look at person-to-person, also known as peer-to-peer or P2P, chat first.

The app includes functionality that shows if a message is read or not by the recipient. As you can see in the screenshot, the viewed message gets a small checkmark next to the time sent indicating that it has been seen by the other part.

Additionally, users can delete messages if they make a typo or change their mind about what they sent.

Group chat

Chatly supports group chat in addition to person-to-person chat. As mentioned above, the logic used for sending messages is the same for both P2P and group messaging. Conditional statements are built in to ensure the proper format is used.

When a message is sent to a group, all members will receive an ! icon on the group chat menu item indicating that they have an unread message.

Send file, video and image attachments via chat

Just like you can with a text message (SMS), iMessage, Slack message, etc., Chatly enables users to send files, images, and videos. Before sending, the app opens a modal window allowing the user to confirm their selected item before sending.

Once the item is sent, it appears in the chat pane as well as the sender’s Files area under their Profile tab.

Light mode & Dark mode

An increasingly popular feature of chat apps is giving the users the ability to switch between a light mode and a dark mode. Some users prefer a dark background with light color text over the traditional light background with dark text.

The Chat App Blueprint comes with a toggle-able light mode and dark mode built in (demonstrated below). This functionality can easily be replicated in other applications that you build.

Light and dark mode are implemented using UI Themes. Three primary extensions are used to determine the colors based on the user’s mode selection: dark_theme , light_theme , and variables .

All extensions are built using CSS Less, giving you the ability to not only add different colors, but also add animations, Mixins, and lots of other cool visual effects.

Closing

Chatly, the Chat App Blueprint, showcases how to implement pub/sub messaging-based chat using UI Builder. The smooth responsive design can be modified to produce your chat app easily.

Why Become A Healthcare Lawyer Has Been So Popular Till Now?,"Manziel Law Offices

Healthcare laws are used to regulate the healthcare system. The laws bridge the gap between medical practitioners and patients. The laws are intricately written to be understood by healthcare lawyers. If you need the services of healthcare lawyers, you need to go to law offices like Manziel Law Offices. There, you’ll meet healthcare lawyers like Lisa Manziel. Lisa Manziel has worked as a healthcare lawyer for thirty years plus. She works at Manziel law offices where she attends to her various clients.

Why Do We Need Healthcare Lawyers?

Healthcare lawyers have the option of working in only one field or work in several fields.

Adherence to Healthcare Laws:

Some health care providers do not obey the law governing medicine. Hence, there is a need to have enforcers enforce the rules with penalties given to rule breakers. For example, medical workers need to follow the HIPAA or risk being punished. The rules are written to protect the rights of providers and patients.

Representation of Clients in Court:

Healthcare lawyers represent providers that are sued by patients or patients that are sued by providers in court. They have the legal responsibility to represent their clients to the best of their abilities.

Why You Should Choose Healthcare Law as A Career

If your future goal is to be a healthcare lawyer, then you’ve chosen the right field. This profession is high in demand right now and requires competent workers due to its complex nature. You have to be hardworking, smart, think on your feet, and be devoted.

One of the duties of healthcare legal practitioners is to resolve any healthcare conflicts. They meet up with their clients and third-party. They make legal documentation and legal research when they want to handle cases.

Healthcare lawyers can work in private or government law offices and pharmacies. Some work with non-governmental organizations and healthcare policymakers.

Here are the reasons why you should consider healthcare lawyer as a career:

Work Independently:

As a healthcare lawyer, you won’t be restricted to one workplace. If you’ve worked for a long time and have a good reputation, you can establish your firm. You can become a CEO, employ other lawyers and earn profits. You can follow the legal trends and integrate them into your firm and get more money.

You Can Practice Anywhere:

Unlike other professionals where you have limitations, lawyers can practice anywhere. You may be in the UK and still practice in Germany. The only thing is that you have to write the bar exams and other qualifications of those places. Then you’d be legally qualified to practice there. You can also take online classes designed by those places to familiarise yourself with their rules.

Increased Need for Healthcare Lawyers:

Many healthcare organizations, providers, and private individuals are soliciting the services of a healthcare lawyer. This may be because they want affordable and excellent healthcare services. It may also be because many people are going for medical treatments now that they can afford them. There is much respect and care given to these lawyers due to their competency.

Contribute to The Society:

The majority of health care lawyers are dedicated and enthusiastic about their works. They want to help those who have been treated unfairly in the medical community. In a nutshell, they use their skills to contribute positively to society. Some help poor people and minority groups who have suffered medical injustice. They help them get compensation for the unfair treatment.

Uphold Medical Ethics:

Lawyers in the healthcare system ensure that providers adhere strictly to the rules. They want healthcare services to be efficiently and fairly delivered. If patients or providers are being exploited, it’s the lawyers’ job to use medical ethics to get justice. Illegal providers, bad healthcare facilities, and unprofessionalism are many issues healthcare lawyers deal with. Their influence can’t be overemphasized because of the positive changes they bring to the medical community.

The Job is Secured:

The profession is one of the highest-paying jobs with high demands out there. 80% of healthcare law graduates secured good jobs after graduation compared to other jobs. There are thousands of employment opportunities for medical law graduates. This is expected to increase by 7% in the next five years. As a lawyer, it’s better to specialize in the medical field and avail yourself of the numerous job openings.

High Income Rate:

As stated earlier, medical law practitioners are one of the highest-paid in the industry. The income is probably double the amount other professionals receive. The more work experience you have the more you get paid. Although, your wage is determined by the place or area you work.

A Science-Based Guide to Recovery for Gaining Muscle Mass,"Recovery Category 3: Nutrition

This wouldn’t be much of a fitness article if I didn’t tell you how I eat. The fact is, exercise alone will not create results. You’ve got to be eating right to support your body in this process.

Now, this topic is both the most simple and the most complex. It’s simple in that I personally only followed one diet during this exercise program. It’s complex because I followed a modified version of the oft-misunderstood ketogenic diet.

I personally do a ketogenic diet with 200 grams of carbs in my evening meal. This diet takes advantage of the muscle-gain effects of ketosis while keeping my glycogen stores high from the nightly carbs.

I also ate carbs more freely on weekends.

Keto is a big subject, and there are many ways to do it wrong. Also, even though this is the diet I chose to adhere to during my training program, it may not be the best for you.

Because of that, instead of talking about keto, I’m going to instead discuss a set of guidelines I follow for any diet when trying to gain muscle:

1. I eat real food

I personally believe that 90% of the success of diets is not what they have you eat, but what they have you stop eating.

People love to bash the newly popular carnivore diet, whereby adherents eat only meat and animal products. But, though the research is sparse, many people notice incredible benefits from this all-meat diet. Tribes throughout history have subsisted on solely animal-based diets, so it’s not exactly a new thing, but I suspect there is another effect that is contributing to these benefits.

They stopped eating all the other crap.

Think about it: How often do you eat something that has 10 or more ingredients that sound like lab chemicals or construction materials?

This is why I think the best first step for anyone who is trying to improve their nutrition is to start eating real, whole foods.

Robb Wolf of The Paleo Podcast says it well: If it didn’t have a face, don’t eat it. Now, obviously plants don’t have faces, but the key to this phrase is to get you to think of eating only things that were recently alive.

Eat plants that look like they are still plants and eat meat.

Don’t eat partially hydrogenated packaged foods, filled with weird ingredients like ammonium sulfate or isinglass.

2. I eat a lot of food

One of the best nutrition tips I’ve ever heard is the three-part mantra: Eat real food. Not too much. Mainly vegetables.

This mantra is great in that it promotes eating things that are natural and meant to go into your body from an evolutionary standpoint, while also getting the well-proven benefits of calorie restriction (eating not too much) and the nutritional power of many leafy green vegetables.

However, when you are trying to build muscle, you need to modify this mantra just a little bit. Instead of restricting your calories, you actually want to increase them.

Building muscle requires, to some extent, a calorie surplus, as well as adequate protein.

Now, personally, I don’t like counting calories, but for the duration of this exercise program, just try not to ever be hungry. If you feel hungry, you are not eating enough.

This is where a keto or low-carb diet can be beneficial, as fats are high-calorie food sources that will help you eat less often. If you go the other way and stick with a higher-carb diet, just try to stick with healthy sources of carbs.

It can be difficult to get high calories from carbs only eating whole vegetables as your food source, however, tubers can really change the game.

I recently discovered, and subsequently fell in love with the Japanese Sweet Potato. These things taste sweet like a yam, but have the texture and consistency of a flaky, chunky regular potato.

Bake ’em in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for an hour and a half, then drown ’em in coconut oil, and you’ve got one of the most delicious sources of healthy carbs I have found to date.

3. I mainly eat lean meat and fats from vegetables

Most of the meat sold in stores here in the U.S. has poor fat composition. Due to the high-grain diet, which is often unnatural for these animals, their fat has high amounts of inflammatory Omega-6 fat and low amounts of Omega-3.

To avoid getting this same situation in my own body, even though I do the high-fat ketogenic diet, I only eat lean, low-fat meat cuts. Then I get my dietary fat from vegetable sources, especially from extra virgin olive oil and avocados.

This extends into simply eating a lot of vegetables in general. A very common day for me is to eat a large, fake “chicken confit” meal consisting of a high amount of grapeseed oil, bok choy, which is a form of oriental cabbage that increases testosterone, and lean chicken breast.

At dinner, when I am restoring my muscle glycogen by adding carbs, I’ll do a sous vide chicken dinner with dinosaur kale and a large Japanese sweet potato. I lather the chicken with Primal Kitchen Avocado Mayonnaise and douse the potato with coconut oil.

During the day I might throw in some snacks in the form of macadamia nuts, or Wild Planet Sardines.

If you can stomach it, grass-fed, grass-finished (do not get any other kind) beef liver is one of the most nutritionally dense foods on the planet, and I try to eat it at least once a week. If you can’t stand the taste, there are some great recipes for making it more palatable using apple cider vinegar or lemon.

Bonus: I do a modified ketogenic diet

The ketogenic diet has been shown in studies to spare the amino acid leucine, which leads to increased muscle gains during weight training compared to high carb diets.

As I mentioned earlier, keto is poorly understood by many people, so I really can’t give you enough info to start keto in this guide alone. However, you may know already that I have written an extensive article on the ketogenic diet already that is posted here on Better Humans.

To use keto for this purpose, and truly follow my personal training plan, go read my guide at: Myths and Mistakes of the Ketogenic Diet, but apply my rules here.

The only difference in what the keto guide suggests and what I do for muscle building is that I don’t restrict calories, and I eat 200 grams of carbs from Japanese sweet potatoes with dinner.

This is so I have enough calories to gain muscle without injury and so that I have enough muscle glycogen (which is just sugar stored in your muscles) for high-intensity exercise that cannot be supported by fat as a fuel source.

You don’t have to do keto as long as you follow the three tips I mentioned here, but I like it better personally.",https://betterhumans.pub/how-i-gained-25-pounds-of-muscle-training-3-days-a-week-or-a-guide-to-recovery-bce2ffc1011,['Keenan Eriksson'],2022-01-06 18:50:23.370000+00:00,"['Recovery', 'Health', 'Biohacking', 'Fitness', 'Keto']"

"10 Hard-Hitting, Not-So-Subtle New Year Thoughts for the Events Industry","I’ve read a few articles on predictions for the global events industry in 2022. Enjoyable reads from those associated with an industry hit hard by COVID. But, in my humble opinion, those articles stop short. They’re incomplete. Off target, at least from my point of view.

There are some chronic problems with events that never seem to get addressed. Others issues are just gaining traction. At events, large and small.

So I decided to offer 10 thoughts of my own, based on my experience as an event director, conference producer, corporate and product marketer, broadcast and streaming media professional, trade show booth set-up and tear-down guy, TV and film background actor, voiceover talent, exhibit hall presenter, CRM industry keynote speaker, writer, content creator, speaking coach, materials handler, frequent flyer… you get the drift.

But they’re not predictions. I wanna be different. 10 thoughts.

I could offer so much more, but here are 10 thoughts, for starters:

1. Public Speakers Will Continue to be Ill-Prepared

Ok, allow me to clarify. The vast, vast, vast majority of public speakers won’t be prepared for their sessions. Not all, but most. This was a problem long before the pandemic, and it’s not changing anytime soon. The evidence is out there for all the world to see and hear as more and more companies decide to go online with event activities. It’s clear and obvious when corporate speakers don’t prep or rehearse. It’s clear when they don’t attempt to use their body language or their voices. While they read slides, waste your time, etc.

You know it 10–15 seconds into a session, and you have an hour to go…

2. Audiences Will Continue to Accept (and Pay for) Bad Presentations

Again, this is a problem that’s been around forever. Nobody checks on what an audience learns — or doesn’t. I’ve been a part of more terrible event, conference, and trade show sessions where the speaker loses an audience from the start, yet receives a polite round of applause from the crowd playing on phones and laptops. Add in the cost of travel, hotel, and food to the price of an event ticket and somebody, somewhere is flushing their money down the drain.

But it usually isn’t the attendee.

3. Panel Discussions Should be Regulated by the FDA

Because they’re putting people to sleep not just in the USA, but across the planet. We may have a new pharmaceutical on our hands.

Years have gone by and I’ve yet to hear somebody say, “WOW! I was blown away by that panel discussion!” Check your next event schedule. Do you see a panel discussion?

Ugh.

I’m guilty of having panel discussions on my programs in the distant past. I’m not sure where the notion of having three to six (or more) people sit in comfy chairs on stage and drone on for an hour became engaging and entertaining. And I’m sure as hell unaware of how anybody can put the same number of people online and called that entertaining. Panel discussions look good an paper, and are very easy to do. It’s a way to accommodate high-paying sponsors and placate know-it-alls with a spot in front the crowd. It’s also a phenomenal way to phone in your next appearance.

Did I mention they’re easy, time fillers… and you’re paying for that…

(In the United States of America, FDA stands for Food and Drug Adminstration.)

4. Investors, CEOs, and CMOs Continue to Struggle with Events

Having been in and around this business for decades, I know what costs what. Investors clearly pay the bill — but they rarely ask questions about event outcomes. Or they wait until it’s too late.

CEOs may actually attend an event — for a moment or two, but they’re rarely around for booth set-up or tear down. And CMOs will stroll into the convention hall with a cup of coffee while the booth is being set, finger point, and they’ll leave just before this exhibit hall closes…with the false sense of knowing they did a great job, but without knowing all there is to know about the results from a just-completed event.

This event and conference stuff costs money.

And if more investors took an interest, and if more CEOs and CMOs had a handle on the totality of their events, expenditures, and outcomes, a different, more engaging and more productive event landscape may exist.

But it doesn’t.

How else can you explain why the business world is offered such outdated, cookie-cutter conventions and boring virtual activities while at the same time finding companies to pay the freight of the high-price tags to participate?

In 2022, some will start to pay attention. Finally.

5. Sales Enablement Continues to Enable… Not Very Much

We’re now in a pandemic age of supporting sales across multiple channels. This includes events. But companies are more concerned with the usage of software platforms to deliver stale content then they are with genuine sales team readiness.

Meanwhile, more time is wasted and there are numbers to be hit.

External sales must be able to speak to content. Inside sales. Executives. Marketing. All front-line personnel, to start. Tech usage for learning is good, but if that’s the major concern, you’ll be left standing on the one yard line.

Sales Readiness is essential for event success.

Example… Think about the last demo you saw. I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. I’m sure there were award-winning graphics and sound. Scripted material. Innovative tech.

But how about the presenter? Storytelling skills…audience interaction…hybrid formats…endurance… If the computer crashed, could the demo continue? Sales Enablement, indeed. You need team readiness for all event formats.

Try it without the tech to exercise personal communication skills.

6. Filler Language Expands its Footprint

Ummm, you know what I mean, uhhh… right?

Filler words are the vocabulary of the unprepared public speaker. Or panelist. Or podcast host, and their guests. Filler words have now expanded into business podcasts. Into virtual and hybrid presentations. You’ve heard them; maybe you use them.

What do I mean ‘maybe’?

Play a game with me. When watching or listening to a session (of any kind) you’ll know within the first 15–30 seconds if a speaker is ready. The filler words will start to fly. Count them. Use your fingers and toes and a pen and paper to count the ummms, uhhhs, you knows, rights…odds are you’ll run out of fingers and toes within a few minutes.

Maybe, ummm, quite possibly, sooner. Ya know?

That’s unfortunate. Filler words are so easy to eliminate.

7. On Podcasts… The Astonishing Lack of Creativity Endures

I read somewhere that the average podcast lasts seven episodes. No surprise, because the average business podcast sounds like, acts like, looks like, and feels like every other podcast… and they’re hard work to produce.

How about some generic music at the beginning?

How about some long-winded bio introductions?

Some poor quality audio, with phone lines or concrete walls?

Brought to you by your host, thrown to wolves on a microphone by those who think a good performance just happens, just because…

… and you expect me to listen for more than 60 seconds?

When the going gets tough and the podcast becomes a marketing pain, most take the path of least resistance. They stop doing them.

Podcasts can play a fun, creative, competitive part in any event activity. But they’re hard work. Good audio, is hard work. Speaker prep, is hard work. Creative usage at events doesn’t come easy. And for those who truly believe that you’re being creative just by having a podcast studio set-up in your booth, that’s old news. That’s been done for decades — in various forms. The world won’t come running to your booth, just because. There are dozens of ways to use creative audio at events, anchored by exceptional podcasts. In-person, virtual, and hybrid.

Show your audience something other than the typical podcast painted-by-number.

8. Sales Kickoffs Need to Adjust

Beyond the safety blanket and the misguided notions behind sales enablement software and learning platforms being the immediate priorities, you’ve got a sales or company kickoff scheduled for early 2022. Of course you do. And I challenge you to think and act differently before, during and after your next kickoff.

But what do you have planned, for this next round? Lemme guess…

Sessions with your CEO, CMO, and Product VPs given an hour each.

Maybe a customer or two and and an analyst, or a special guest, also with an hour each.

Some sales stories. A few case studies.

And a dash of product marketing…as in “Here’s Tony, at 9:30 Wednesday morning, to tell you everything you need to know about GTM strategy, messaging, positioning, content, alliances, and competitive intel, and how this will play out at events… after his 30 minutes, we’ll break at 10.”

Throw that away. For those who want an idea for 2022 sales kickoff, try the Product Marketing Gauntlet.

With Omicron at the outset of 2022, you need an agile, fully-prepared sales team to excel in any format of market interaction. Then again, you’ve needed that all along and you still offered the same cookie-cutter sales kickoff format.

This year, get into the sales and team readiness game and try something else.

9. Alternatives to Trade Shows and Conventions Will Increase

As much as I can’t stand senior leadership’s obliviousness when it comes to events, there are some rumblings from some business people about long-in-the-tooth event formats, their effectiveness, and time and wallet-draining expenses.

in 2022, you don’t have to jump back into any single industry event and spend a boatload of your marketing money. I suggested 10 Alternatives, and your options are only increasing. And nobody is going to think you’re going out of business if you don’t have a 30’ x 30’ booth or spend six and seven figures at the next Vegas or Northern California event. There are newer, better, and more cost-efficient and effective ways to engage audiences vs. the tired exercise of fighting your way through a pandemic to Midtown Manhattan or the Chicago Lakefront for a week-long marathon.

Especially in explosive arena of B2B Tech Marketing.

10. Understanding Event Selection, Prep, Execution, and Measurement is Critical

Some want the Vegas boondoggle. Others want to play the role of big shot sponsor in Northern California. Still others just buy what some event producers are selling…just because.

Great, enjoy.

For those serious about their events, faced with choosing when and where to place their investments in 2022 and 2023, you must apply critical business perspectives to all event activities. That time is now.

You’re spending limited resources, and this affects how you choose events, how well your speakers are prepared, the depth of your content, how sales skills are strengthened, exhibit hall, branding, and booth activities, opportunity generation, on-line and in-person engagements, measurement and reporting… and so much more.

As we enter 2022, possessing this business acumen around events has never been more important. For astute investors and executives, it’s all table stakes now.

—

Marketing, is under duress. CMOs have short windows of opportunities, and short tenures.

The process of how events are approached, executed, and measured plays a huge role in marketing and sales success. And event shortcomings have only been exposed and exasperated during the pandemic.

For those who wish to keep doing what you’re doing with events, I wrote about my experience here. All the best to you in 2022.

For those who understand the Event Gauntlet that will challenge you in 2022, welcome to a new business landscape like you’ve never seen before.

I predict radically redesigned sales and marketing opportunities involving events will be endless.

Life Changing Experience at NYC Public School,"So I had a pretty wild life experience last week. After reaching out to a bunch of NYC schools in hopes of performing a guest reading of The Nestomir — a few schools responded enthusiastically to me! And last Tuesday I had the opportunity to perform a guest reading for The Urban Assembly Gateway School for Technology, a public high school in Manhattan, NY.

When the day came, I had no idea what I was going to say or do…what on Earth do you say to a group of skeptical, hard-to-impress teenagers? I decided it was not something I couldn’t easily plan for (I did have a few notes scribbled on a post-it taped to the front of my copy of the story), but I knew I would have to adapt to the situation in real time. And I was right.

(Presenting to the tenth graders of The Urban Assembly Gateway School for Technology)

When I showed up to the school’s main entrance, the security guard walked me up to the English classroom where I was scheduled to present. The teacher immediately greeted me…and to sum up what she told me: Good luck! These kids are a fidgety bunch, you’re going to have work really hard to get them to pay attention!

Great. Then the bell rang. The kids began to pour inside the room. What was quite comical: the kids could tell something was different about their class today…leading them to believe they had a pop quiz. To their relief, it was only a guest speaker.

The teacher gave me a brief intro, then I made my walk up to the front of the classroom. My only objective: do not let them fall asleep, no matter the cost.

What I Did:

I quickly intro’d myself, then I immediately asked the class if they wanted to perform a freestyle rap battle contest. This caught them off guard and perked their attention up…a few kids even selected classmates to compete…but I told them I would save this activity for next time I visit.

Next, I decided to put the book down. My gut told me to speak about my adventures learning to code. I spoke about learning key software engineering lessons from my first business partner. I got some engagement…but not enough.

The tide turned when I began to speak about my greatest life challenges, including when it came to performing in school. My greatest academic challenge came during my first semester of engineering school. I came into college with a high school work ethic, and that was a fail. I was used to doing everything last minute; I had no understanding of discipline or work ethic. That first college semester I had a big scare…but it ultimately led me to going from one of the world’s biggest procrastinators to someone who is obsessed with organization and being extremely disciplined when attacking new work and projects. The kids really took to this speaking segment…I got a lot of questions and heads perked up. And as a result, more kids paid attention to the short reading I performed.

I didn’t want to write too long of a post. But what I learned most: people, no matter if they are kids or adults, like to hear about struggle. It wasn’t until I spoke about the serious battles I faced in my life that I became credible and the kids paid me real attention. I hope to use these experiences talking to students to become a better mentor, educator, and author in the future.

ps: I will be presenting to a bunch of other NYC/Long Island public schools in January/February 2022! Stay tuned.

Have a great week!

The Footsoldiers of the Next French Revolution,"Thinking myself relatively clued up on french style, it didn’t come as a shock when I arrived in Paris and saw that in fact very few French women wear berets — what was much more surprising was that in the final throes of 2021, there are UGGs absolutely everywhere.

It may just be the circles I move in, or the galvanising echo-chamber effects of social media, but I was under the impression that the fashion world had left UGGs (definitely and determinedly) in the late noughties. Now, 10 years later, they appear to be back, in the fashion capital of the world of all places. Questions abound — why? how? who? WHY? and I for one like to think that the answer lies in the reinvention of the elusive phenomenon that is the Parisienne.

Entire books — many of them — have been written on how to perfect the air of the archetypal Parisian woman (or perhaps, in true french style, implicitly reminding foreign readers of the impossibility of this task), whilst countless iterations of this red-lipped, trench-coated character have taken centre stage in all forms of media and art.

The pop-culture interpretation of French-girl chic is an image that I’ve long aspired to. I’ve completed the tousled bob, and painstakingly embraced the semi-undone ‘did my makeup in 15 seconds flat’ aesthetic. ‘The’ Parisienne embodied the effortless elegance that my awkward and uncertain teenage self wished to exude, and that is what started me on the path to my current mode de vie, teaching English in a Parisian suburb. Now, despite having enthusiastically pursued this image for several years, I’m beginning to realise that I misunderstood it.

To start with, effortless beauty is a myth. Life is messy and unexpected and some days it is impossible to control anything, least of all your hair. More importantly however, we must ask ourselves who exactly this image is supposed to depict. In my time here so far, i’ve not met a single person who could, practically speaking, fit into the mould that several decades of film and literature have cast. Perhaps part of the allure all along was the impossibility of the thing — but a growing movement, which includes authors such as fashion journalist Alice Pfeiffer and culture writer Lindsey Tramuta, is highlighting the oversights of this particular trope.

The Parisienne is a sort of heroine immune to all biological, generational and social norms… Generation after generation of Parisiennes share certain characteristics and answer to the same style criteria, which are implicit but omnipresent: social class, education, appearance, lineage, skin colour… (‘Je ne suis pas parisienne’, Alice Pfeiffer — my own translation)

Their argument is intertwined with a particularity of the French constitution, which, although perhaps well-intentioned, can be seen to propagate racial disparity — ‘la laïcité’. Similar to the notion of secularity, laïcité does not permit the french state to collect official data on race, ethnicity or religion, nor discuss these subjects in the public sphere. Although the goal is to treat citizens equally, this ‘colourblindness’ can render minority groups invisible.

As Pfeiffer points out in the first chapter of her 2019 book ‘Je ne suis pas Parisienne’, there is no one image that can be associated with a Londoner, or the ladies of New York. They have many faces. In fact (for me at least), part of the draw of London is its melting-pot culture; so diverse are the identities of Londoners that diversity becomes the identity itself. This is not so in France, where, under the law, the one and only acceptable cultural identity is ‘French’.

Unfortunately for the french state, we live in an age where distinct cultural groups exist by default. There will always be a set of people in France who are of Asian origin, or who practise Islam, or who are first generation immigrants, regardless of whether or not they are permitted to openly express these aspects of their identity. Further, the divisions between these groups are exacerbated in times of social change. Although the juggernaut that is COVID has effected significant practical changes on all of our lives, the burden has landed disproportionately on certain strata of society; meanwhile, the resurgence of Black Lives Matter has woken us up to the importance of representation.

The french goal of repressing ‘communautarisme’ (the formation of these culture-based identity groups) cannot answer to either of these aspects of modern life, and nor can the invariably white, perfectly put together femme that we know as the Parisienne. Unable to make themselves heard or seen, members of minority communities can only watch as they are (mis)represented, time and time again, by an image whose singularity is a continuation of that which laïcité necessarily entails.

The traditional Parisienne is a caricature whose aesthetic I will continue to admire, but times are changing and UGGs may well be a step in the right direction. I maintain that the nickname ‘UGGlies’ is not undeserved — but that is exactly what makes this worth writing. Sporting such monstrously fluffy footwear constitutes a small act of rebellion against the trope of the Parisienne, whilst still managing to convey its one valuable message: not worrying too much about what you look like.

Come 2022, the Parisienne craves the same physical comfort and spiritual healing that many of us now seek more actively.

A New York City small business’s mission to help kids “discover their greatness” through social-emotional learning.

As Soleil Laurent and Arianna Silver walked the mile from their neighborhood in Bushwick, Brooklyn to Blink Fitness — a routine that began after they met by chance in spring 2019 and became friends— they discussed the usual: personal development, growth, and vulnerability.

After enduring physical and emotional bullying from grade five through high school, Laurent and Silver connected on their journeys growing from those and other negative experiences. Laurent, a musician and student of psychology and neuroscience, and Silver, a life coach who studied sociology, strode down Bushwick’s Knickerbocker Avenue, discussing their knowledge from their educations, a myriad of self-improvement books, and their commitment to understanding emotions.

“As we got deeper into these conversations, we realized that a lot of the stuff that we were talking about at this age in our lives were things that would have been totally transformational if we had learned them as kids,” said Silver. “Basically, if you had taught me in school how to deal with my emotions the same way you taught me math, I would be a totally different person.”

The “stuff” Silver mentioned is defined as social-emotional learning, or the process through which individuals “acquire the knowledge, attitudes, and skills to: recognize and manage their emotions, set and achieve positive goals, demonstrate caring and concern for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, make responsible decisions, and handle interpersonal situations effectively,” according to the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, a nonprofit leader in social-emotional research. This sort of education is proven to be successful for children, with several studies of both short-term and long-term effects demonstrating improvements in interpersonal skills and feelings of personal growth while lowering emotional distress and conduct issues.

When the COVID-19 pandemic swept over the globe and a national reckoning with systemic racism came to the forefront of public consciousness in 2020, dealing with emotions and processing emotional distress could not have been more necessary for youth in the minds of Laurent and Silver. They began having conversations on Instagram Live in July 2020, reflecting on issues of the pandemic and racial injustices like the murder of George Floyd. The positive response to their conversations paired with their personal passion for social-emotional learning led to the beginning of Equality Education, a small-business with the goal of providing a 60-module social-emotional and diversity-centered curriculum as well as empowering merchandise to children and schools.

“The world shook,” said Laurent, “and people, especially kids, need a better foundation within themselves. And that foundation can be built with the tools we create for them to access.”

Equality Education’s curriculum, which launches in mid-2022, is coming to fruition at a time when schools across New York City are implementing social-emotional learning practices. The city’s Bridge to School initiative, which received an almost two million dollar investment by the Department of Education and Fund for Public Schools, provides trauma-informed training to educators and social-emotional and mental health support for the city’s nearly 1.1 million students.

Chirlane McCray, First Lady of New York City, said in the 2021-2022 Bridge to School plan that “preparing our young people for success means helping them deal with the social, emotional, and academic challenges of their lives. It means teaching them ways to process their many emotions and showing them how to build healthy relationships and resolve conflicts in a constructive way. That is how we help them flourish into happy, healthy adults.”

Equality Education’s goal is to be a resource for schools, particularly ones in underfunded communities where research finds that funding differences are inequitable between schools with highest and lowest needs based on students living in poverty. According to the New York City Council, the schools in need of equitable funding and adequate resources — including social-emotional pratices — are in communities of color.

“We are looking to take funds from schools that can afford our almost $2,300 institutional membership to the curriculum and use that money to give the program to people and schools who might not have the funds to be able to access it themselves,” said Silver.

“We're big-hearted people that just want the best for others,” said Laurent, explaining their motivations. “Life is going to have a lot of challenges, but we want to provide resources and tools for kids to move forward and grow, especially kids who may be in tougher situations than others.”

At its core, Equality Education’s curriculum focuses on the “development of human consciousness through mental health awareness, emotional intelligence, and perception of others,” according to its official website. The program covers topics from positive self-talk, gratitude, and decision-making to valuing individuality and diversity, communication techniques, and growth from failure. It contains animated teaching episodes, writing prompts, a neuro-linguistic programming series, child-parent exercises, and more, catering to any type of learner (whether visual, auditory, or kinesthetic). While the curriculum will be available for individuals to subscribe to for about $20 a month, its primary goal is to be bought and distributed within schools, which is why it is geared towards children ages 2 to 18.

The co-founders explained that as they develop the curriculum, the concepts will be the same across the spectrum, but the material will vary depending on the age group. “With a kid who's being introduced to it as a two year old, it's a little different than something that we might teach 18 year old,” said Silver, explaining that younger age groups will have simpler activities that engage their attention like animated videos and coloring activities, while older kids will have more complex journaling activities or discussion prompts.

“Being human is human. That's really the basis of what we're teaching,” said Laurent, summarizing the curriculum.

Laurent and Silver invested a large amount of their own money to start the business, a number they cannot even begin to estimate. “When it comes to investing in Equality Education, it's almost automatic,” said Laurent. “We essentially send $500, send $1000, send this, send that. And we've been doing that for a year, all because we have faith in this for children.”

As the curriculum awaits its launch, the business sells empowering merchandise like posters, art, clothing and accessories in order to fund the production of the 60-module program. The best-selling product is the “I AM” affirmations coloring book with hand-drawn images and affirmations ranging from “I am worthy, abundant and grateful,” to “I am in control of my emotions.” The hands-on resource represents the power of their coming curriculum. By coloring the pages and repeating the affirmations, kids and people of all ages begin to practice a sense of self confidence and believe in the words they say, explained Silver.

Equality Education’s “I AM” affirmations coloring book sits front and center at the vendor booth on Monday, November 29, 2021. It can be bought for oneself or donated to a local charity the small business partnered with this season called “Sheltering Arms,” which helps foster social equity in New York City’s challenged communities. (Photo by Kasia O’Brien).

Equality Education’s curriculum takes this concept of practicing self-empowerment and social-emotional awareness and expands it into multiple modalities.

“I’m so excited,” said Laurent loudly, reflecting on their passing $20,000 in sales and their curriculum’s quickly approaching launch. “My whole body is in flames because it’s like, I wish I had this when I was a kid,” she continued, smiling from ear to ear.

Equality Education is currently undergoing a licensing process to become a Department of Education vendor with the ability to offer its curriculum to New York City schools. In the meantime, the business takes every opportunity to spread its message and products, from operating an Etsy shop and vending booths to conducting workshops.

This winter season, in a sea of over 160 vendors making up the tightly packed winding aisles of New York City’s Union Square Holiday Market, Laurent and Silver sit inside booth C34. Illuminated by suspended twinkling lights, the colorful bubble-lettered words on their products declaring that “love creates love,” and “powerful people empower other people,” jump out from the booth’s neutral walls. Holiday Market goers stop and flip through the coloring book. “No age is too young for kids to get introduced to this,” says Silver to a few customers gathered around their booth, “it’s never too young to learn unconditional love within ourselves and how to give it to others.”",https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/the-equality-education-inspiring-greatness-in-kids-in-new-york-city-7a23f1f2170,"[""Kasia O'Brien""]",2022-01-24 22:59:49.088000+00:00,"['NYC', 'Small Business', 'Social Emotional Learning', 'Empowerment', 'Curriculum']"
Using Illustrations To Change The Face Of Business,"Using Illustrations To Change The Face Of Business

Illustration by issam laaziz

Have you ever had a professional photoshoot for your website or resume? Why, if you could just take some selfies? You choose professional photographers because good-looking, polished photos made in one style increase your reliability and status in the eyes of others: either a target audience or employers.

Similar principles apply to design, especially where illustration is used. Professional illustration has a number of benefits that, like a photoshoot made in a studio, cannot be substituted.

Let’s discover why and how often companies use IT outsourcing services to create illustrations, and take inspiration from some of the best practices among our case studies.

If design solves business problems and fine art predicts the future, then illustration is a medium between them.

— Sergiy Maidukov, The NY Times & The Washington Post illustrator

Why do companies outsource graphic design and illustration?

Graphic design implies creating visual content that communicates a certain message. Illustrations may be considered part of the former, but the major difference between graphic design and illustrations is where/how you use it. Graphic design projects have more commercial meaning. Meanwhile, illustrations are somewhere on the borderline between creating fine art and making profits.

Graphic design vs illustration by Vladanland

There are several reasons why companies pay someone to create visuals for them:

Saving money . Yep, paying for these services pays off in the future, and never mind the wordplay. In-house design team equals payroll costs, taxes, buying licensed software like Adobe After Effects, time to find the employees that get you. Design agencies charge only for the work done.

When a company doesn’t have in-house designers or expertise in a specific area, it doesn’t need to train its team. Especially if the project is not long-term or when the tasks are one-time. Also, an external team solves the problem of insufficient workload or overload of staff personnel.

The company’s own design team needs guidance and management, and in a design agency, all processes are built by project managers, an art director, etc. Efficiency of core business. When a company chooses to outsource, it is not distracted from its strategic objectives and product development.

There’s no strong brand without competent design. The design, especially creative illustrations, requires a significant investment of money, time, and effort. But the good news is that illustrating is not usually a recurring process, but a one-time project. So companies hire professionals without pausing their strategic management.

How often do brands rely on professionals to create illustrations?

Illustration by Shakuro

The IT outsourcing services market is huge. Some time ago, Statista published research that shows that the IT-application outsourcing services market revenue in Poland is expected to reach $540 million by 2021. And that’s data for only one of the member states of the EU. The global IT outsourcing market amounted to $92.5 billion in 2019.

And what about graphic design and illustration services? $45.8 billion — is the global graphic designers market size in 2021:

Graphic design market size according to IBIS

Where illustration is used? As of 2018, 73% of businesses invest in design to help their brand stand out against the competition. In the same research by Adobe, it was also reported that 71% of companies are now creating 10x the number of design assets than they did in previous years.

Excerpts from the research by Adobe

Most small businesses acknowledge that design is important to their success. Only 3% indicated the opposite. With this data, we can conclude that most of the companies choose to outsource their design to professional agencies like Shakuro.

How do illustrations change the face of business?

Creative illustration is a mediator between mass consumer and high art. Modern European trends come from 20th century art.

If design solves problems and art looks to the future, then illustration is a medium between them. An illustration is a layer of information between the meaning of a certain object and the way that viewers understand it for themselves. The illustration has no purpose in realistically conveying reality. It can be abstract and convey emotions.

Illustrations are a powerful tool for bonding with a target audience. There are several ways illustrations can change the face of business:

They show your story

How to convince others to invest resources in your brand? Sometimes it’s hard to find the words. Sometimes there are too many words and no one reads them. Show your purpose, values, processes with illustrations. Don’t tell. We talk more about this point in this article.

They create an emotional bond

How illustration shows emotions? They can be positive or negative. Some of us were legit horrified by Francisco Goya’s paintings when we were kids. But art can convey love and hope too. Custom illustrations will make other people feel: trust, warmth, even the “uwus”. And feelings = bonding, important for all businesses alike. At Shakuro, we create illustrations for both B2C and B2B industries. People are more likely to associate themselves with cartoon characters than with the models in the photo. Looking at the staged photos, it is immediately clear that this is just a written script. Illustrations evoke the feeling of “yeah, I feel the same”:

The coziness of Shakuro’s 2D illustration

They convey the mood and imprint on others’ memories

All successful brands have one thing in common — personality. You can design a brand to be friendly, broadminded, optimistic, memorable. Running a successful business already, but want to show its new side? Make your brand more human with illustrations, as Etsy did. But not with stock photos — they are like Comic Sans nowadays. Leave the work to Shakuro’s professional artists.

With animations, they make a product to really stand out

Have you heard that awful joke about a snail? One man wanted his snail to be more aerodynamic and took off its shell, but it just made the snail more sluggish. What really could’ve added dynamic to a poor creature, are animated illustrations. In the right doses, they can be a real eye-catcher.

Illustrations are a visual soundtrack to your brand

For our visual cortex neurons, custom illustration is like music to our ears. It can turn your existing website or application into a symphony, minimalistic — or art-deco piece of art. Good design agencies make illustrations without disrupting the visual identity of a brand or company. They enhance things, and make art work.

Case study: creating a friendly environment

Craftverse is an aspiring crowdfunded platform for cosplay enthusiasts from around the world to share knowledge, seek advice, socialize, and explore job opportunities in this exciting creative industry.

They came to Shakuro seeking to create the site and the mobile application. You can learn more about the step-by-step process of our work with this case in our article. This cartoonish style of illustrated characters makes the overall look of the cosplay platform more open-minded and friendly. It creates an atmosphere of understanding and sincerity.

Case study: connecting a product with its audience through a mascot

A mascot is a character who embodies an idea, be it a company, a product, a team, or a brand. To put it simply, it’s a character you think of whenever a brand’s name pops up. Mascots are different, but in most cases they are animals. Anthropomorphic or not — it’s up to a client to decide. Often you can see mascots as 2D animated characters.

Mascots unite people of different ages, professions, and nationalities. Look at the character that we created for Crizit:

Food illustration

When it comes to food illustrations, the goal is often to celebrate, convey a sense of joy, and emphasize its ability in bringing people together. Color handles this perfectly.

3D illustration

3D illustrations can fit perfectly into the concept of your web resource. They not only make the site more memorable, but also improve the user experience, allowing you to control the attention of the visitor. They also look more expensive, especially if the 3D characters creation is included. The main thing is not to overdo it: such elements should look appropriate, not complicate the interaction with the site and not slow down its loading.

How to start outsourcing illustrations?

Illustration by Shakuro

If you decide to outsource, the next question is where to start? Posting your job on collaboration platforms is not enough, and even dangerous if you are on to something special about your product. Usually, clients turn to digital agencies to create visuals within a new web development project. But illustration, especially animated characters, can also improve an existing website or an app.

You can post your web development project that includes illustrations with just a brief statement of what you want and how you want it, and let agencies contact you.

You can research competition and see who does illustration for them.

You can formulate a list of requirements for your illustration and, eventually, you will narrow the circle to the outsourcing companies that fit best.

You can just write to a certain agency of your choice. This option is best for those who don’t really know how they want their illustrations to look like, except from competitors’ examples, but don’t want to copy or create indistinguishable/stock pictures.

Finding the balance and the best-fitting expertise for your custom project is the main challenge. From our experience, people who are satisfied with our work willingly recommend us to their connections. You can learn more about how to outsource web development processes in our separate article.

In conclusion

Graphic illustration is not just pretty pictures. They unite and enhance the entire user experience as a whole. Any business can be successful in design, whether it’s a product or a service. It all depends on a wise choice of outsourcing company. BTW, if you want to create an app, you might want to read our article on how to hire an outsourcing agency that gets you right.

Sqribble Ebook Creator REVIEWED!,"In this review, I’m going to be taking a closer look at Sqribble — a brand new cloud-based tool that allows you to create eBooks, reports, whitepapers or other digital books on the fly, quickly and easily.

We’ll cover what it does, who it’s for, how much it costs, what the upsells are, and the pros and cons of this new tool, so you can make a more informed decision about purchasing it… and if it’s right for you.

Sqribble is a cloud based eBook creator tool. It allows you to create professional looking eBooks, based on templates inside the tool, with a few clicks, saving you a huge amount of time and money.

Unlike other eBook creators, Sqribble immediately caught my attention because it has some really useful features I haven’t seen anywhere else.

Automatic content — yep, you can actually use Sqribble to fill your book with expert content, so you don’t have to write a word. This is content from around the web, based on the URL you provide. You can pull content from any URL, paste it directly, extract from a Word doc or from their own library of niche articles. Total game changer.

This is a HUGE time saver and a major plus for anyone who hates writing or doesn’t have time to do it.

Gorgeous eCovers — a lot of eBook tools might save time, but they turn out terrible eCovers for your books. Sqribble is different here. The covers are seriously impressive. They wouldn’t look out of place on Kindle or Amazon, and they instantly look like you’re a professional who commands trust and authority.

Create Flipbooks — this is one of my favorite things about Sqribble. You can turn your “flat” books into interactive flipbooks. This makes your digital book look and feel much more like a real book — with pages that turn (animated like a real book page turning) and make the book look like something you can reach out and grab.

Why does this matter?

It’s about standing out and grabbing attention. Plus, it’s a way to engage your readers better. If they enjoy the experience of reading your book (“flipping” the pages) they’re more likely to get value from your content and keep reading until the end where your pitch or call to action is! Another thing about flip books is that you can embed them on your website with a simple piece of code that Sqribble provides once you publish your book. Awesome!

What else can Sqribble do?

Sqribble is versatile tool, with tons more features I found useful. For example, here’s what else Sqribble can do:

— Automatic table of contents

— Automatic headers and footers

— Automatic pagination

— Drag and drop design

— Add or delete pages

— Add your own media

— 300+ Google Fonts

— 50 eBook templates (covering 15 different niches)

— 10 different eBook themes (1 click changes color scheme of book)

— Import content from a URL

— Manually add content

And that’s just the stuff I saw inside the dashboard!

There’s tons of features packed into this tool, making it one of the best eBook creators I’ve seen, but there is one slight negative point which I’ll cover down below.

Disclaimer: This post contains affiliate links. This means I may earn a commission should you chose to sign up for a program or make a purchase using my link. It’s okay – I love all of these companies anyways, and you will too!

Sqribble is most suited for freelancers, independent internet marketers, small marketing agencies and small business owners who want to create lead magnets, publish Kindle books, create and sell eBooks, or publish whitepapers.

If you’re also looking to create an additional income you’ll be pleased to know that also included is a commercial agency license to use Sqribble for client work, offering eBook creation services, with the ability to create unlimited eBooks which you can sell and keep all the profits!

They also give you a ready built agency website with pre-filled portfolio that you can upload to any domain for instant authority, so that you can show it off to any new potential clients to get work. (Professional websites like this would cost you at least $600 alone, so it’s really good value.)

Also included is an in-built “Client feedback tool” to collaborate with clients on eBook projects more easily (I love this feature).

What does it cost?

Normally $197, but the special launch price is a one-time $47.

Any upsells?

Yes, there are currently 4 upsells. You don’t really need all of them to use Sqribble, but they might come in useful depending on your situation and usage.

Upsell 1 — Sqribble professional.

Unlock 150 more professional eBook templates (the best ones are in the professional version), graphics and even more ready — made content for all kinds of niches. (Just so you know, single templates from stock websites would cost you up to $450… for just ONE template!) Great for those that want more variety, content and heavy users.

Upsell 2 — Sqribble Prime.

Get 15 premium “limited edition” new eBook templates added to your Sqribble dashboard every month. This will increase your library over time, and make you stand out from other users. It works out to less than two bucks for a template! (Much cheaper than stock sites.) Great for moderate users.

Upsell 3 — Sqribble Fantasia 3D.

This includes 2-in-1 features.

1.) Unlocks a 3D cover creation tool inside your dashboard, allowing you to turn “flat” covers into lifelike, 3d covers. Great for getting more attention and making your books look and feel more “real.” People do judge a book by its cover, so something to keep in mind.

2.) Create “Flipbooks” that turn your eBooks into interactive and animated pages that turn like in real life. They can be linked to from anywhere online, as well as embedded on web pages with a single piece of code. This is really cool.

Upsell 4 — Auto Job Finder software.

If you’re going to be using Sqribble to create eBooks as a service to get paid, then Auto Job Finder is something that you need. It will automatically find you related jobs across various freelance websites and notify you so that you can fulfil them. A huge time saver and money earner.

The bad

— 3D cover is locked behind an upsell

The good

— Easy to use

— Glitch free

— Unlimited use (one-time payment)

The awesome

— Tons of beautiful templates

— Professional page layouts

— Automatic content (saves time)

— Flipbook creator (available through 3rd upsell)

There have been plenty of eBook creator tools in the past, but I haven’t seen any that make the entire process as smooth and quick as Sqribble. It’s surprisingly glitch free (most low-priced tools like this are buggy as hell) and it’s packed with some really cool features.

The templates are very nice looking, the layouts are professional and the fact you can automatically add content makes this a must have for anyone who’s tired of spending hours slaving over book design, writing content and screwing around with formatting.

The icing on the cake is the commercial license which is included. Normally vendors charge extra for this, so it’s a huge value added bonus. The additional provided done-for-you agency website is just over delivery.

Sqribble has been developed by Adeel Chowdhry, who is a well-known internet entrepreneur and best seller, with over ten years of experience and has previously created worldwide hits such as Pixel Studio FX which sold tens of thousands of units all around the world. He’s known for creating high quality professional solutions and I expect no less from Sqribble.

If you’re planning to create eBooks, reports or Kindle books in the near future, you owe it to yourself — and your sanity — to pick this up as it’s a tool that you’ll definitely need in your business.

Whatsapp needs to address the most important Usability Heuristic — #1: Visibility of System Status,"In this story, I am going to illustrate a use case for Whatsapp mobile app and share an experience on how “Visibility of status” is very important for a product to be usable for “all” users.

I really didn't feel good about what happened to one of my beloved family members while using this app and I spent some time reproducing and understanding the root cause for this use case.

The story of the person I am narrating is a 60-year-old retired government officer and a father of 2 daughters. He is not a tech-savvy person. He never uses the “Whatsapp status” feature. While he was on a FaceTime video call with his daughters, he wanted to forward a photo(confidential information) using Whatsapp on his iPhone. While attempting to forward this media, while on the Facetime Video call, he accidentally happened to select the “My status” option. Due to this, the confidential information was uploaded as his status and unfortunately exposed to all his contacts.

What motivates the user to use “Whatsapp on mobile”?

To keep in touch with his daughters, who live overseas. To share memorable pictures and videos with his daughters. Stay in touch with family and friends.

Decode

Started to think about various options of how one can share any kind of media while they are simultaneously on a “Facetime Video” call. Refer — Use other apps during a FaceTime call on iPhone

Steps to reproduce.

Call one of your friends using the Facetime video call.

Once the Facetime video call has been answered, open the WhatsApp application and let the Facetime’s video bubble stay to the top right.

Note — one can use other apps during a FaceTime or Whatsapp Video call on iPhone.

Now, open one of your Whatsapp chats/conversations with your friend, lookup for any media that was shared with you.

Once we long press on the media, we see the menu that holds an option “Forward”. Select “Forward” and click on the “forward icon” to the bottom left.

The user now is redirected to a screen to make a selection from a list of active contacts within the WhatsApp application. This list also includes the “Whatsapp Status”.

1. In the previous screen, there are 2 important things to notice that lack “Visibility of Status” to the user. The selection circle for the first 3 contacts is hidden behind the Facetime video bubble to the top right.

2. Before the user performs the primary action to “forward” the user does not have visibility on the count of the selections made on the current screen.

Possible Solution(s)

How can we solve this use case to meet the usability heuristic — Visibility of System Status?

I brainstormed a couple of ideas and came up with the below 2 possible design solutions to address the use case to make users’ flow intuitive and not to leave them in a chaotic situation that they might never notice.

4 Best Practices I Recommend When Deciding On Which NFT Project To Invest In,"4 Best Practices I Recommend When Deciding On Which NFT Project To Invest In Mohammed Machraoui Dec 30, 2021·3 min read

NFT Shopping 101

When deciding which NFT project is suitable for you, you should ask a lot of questions. This, like investing in cryptocurrency, is heavily dependent on your unique strategy. Today, we’ll look at some best practices for NFT shopping.

Which Blockchain?

When deciding which NFT to purchase, one of the first things you should consider is the blockchain on which it is constructed. This year has seen a slew of blockchains emerge to compete with Ethereum.

When it comes to overall NFT volume, Ethereum is by far the clubhouse leader. The majority of new and existing A-List projects are hosted on ETH. During the peak of 2021 NFT hype, we saw a number of chains emerge to compete with ETH by offering lower gas/transaction costs.

Cardano, WAX, Solana, and Binance are other prominent chains. These are just a few examples of the numerous options available.

What Type of NFT?

The next step in purchasing your NFT is determining which type to purchase. That can be a little perplexing, but what I mean is what utility your new NFT will have.

NFTs were first as simple as a profile picture (PFP). CryptoPunks is a prime example of this, and they are among the most expensive NFT to acquire. It doesn’t hurt that they were among the earliest NFTs. Not to add, Visa purchased one in August.

When Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) released its soon-to-be blue-chip NFT, they changed up the utility element. When you bought your BAYC in April, you also got unique access to their Club. Fast forward eight months, and it has grown into a very elite Club to be a part of. The most intriguing aspect is that this “Club” includes some of the most different members. Steph Curry, Post Malone, Jimmy Fallon, Logan Paul, and others are among the members you may be familiar with.

Because time passes at warp speed in the NFT universe, the utility of contemporary NFTs is limitless. Virtual real estate inside The Sandbox, Decentraland, and other platforms appears to be popular right now. The same goes with play-to-earn games. As with most things in crypto, most of this is speculative, which is why having a strategy is essential.

You’ll be much better prepared to go shopping once you’ve decided on the chain and type of NFT you want. But now that you’ve done all of that legwork, which NFT should you get?

Best Practices?

It’s never easy to predict whether NFT will be the next BAYC or your winning lottery ticket. However, there are certain general recommended practices to follow while investing.

The following are some common measures to take:

Community: As we frequently preach here, community is HUGE. Discord discussions and social media might provide insight into a potential investment’s community. Helpful community members are essential, particularly in the early phases of a project.

As we frequently preach here, community is HUGE. Discord discussions and social media might provide insight into a potential investment’s community. Helpful community members are essential, particularly in the early phases of a project. Leadership: Investigate who started the initiative and what their plan is. Is this a money grab for someone, or do they have a strategy that is similar to yours? Every hour, a new NFT project is launched, so the project’s leaders are crucial. Especially if you’re putting your own money into the endeavor.

Roadmap: What is their plan when the initial FOMO subsides? It is normal for a project to start and then lose traction due to a lack of a defined plan for their community. A roadmap should outline the strategy and provide an overview of how they intend to carry out their main ideas. It’s always a fluid scenario, and things may change rapidly, which is why the project’s leadership is critical.

Does It Make Sense: When considering an NFT investment, it’s essential that the project makes sense to YOU. Can you see the long-term goal coming to fruition, can you imagine additional people wanting to invest in this initiative, and so on? There is no correct or incorrect response, but the more information you have, the better.

Maybe this is the year you receive your first NFT?",https://medium.com/@next_shore/4-best-practices-i-recommend-when-shopping-an-nft-e740d7405a38,['Mohammed Machraoui'],2022-01-16 10:14:01.231000+00:00,"['Best Practices', 'Nft', 'Nft Marketplace', 'Shopping', 'Crypto']"

"Are You Ready For NFT Marketplace Development On Polygon? — Overview, Benefits, And Features.","Ever wondered if emotions can hold a price? But NFT’s made that possible! That’s the exclusiveness of this digital asset. Whether tangible or intangible, existent or non-existent objective, NFT can establish a unique address and value to them. In crux, the characteristics and apathy that it exhibits among all its assets have led to more outstanding results and popularity in a wider space.

The evolution of NFT is a fascinating tale of how it began as pixelated punk and the advancements that led to its Metaverse. It can now work on any object and be deployed on any platform. NFTs are becoming increasingly polymorphic as time and technology advance. Polygon NFT marketplace is one among the efficient legends.

Let’s soak into the benefits of NFT marketplace development on Polygon without any delay.

What is Polygon blockchain?

The Ethereum blockchain network remains one of the best in the crypto world and is perhaps why every new token aspires to be part of the Ethereum network. One such reason for the trustworthiness and legacy of the network is its reliability and network stability. Nonetheless, scalability is a major concern for Ethereum. As a solution, Ethereum introduced its layer two protocol, Polygon NFT, which is similar to the blockchain but cannot be called one. Experts refer to it as a side chain.

Polygon was initially known as Matic NFT. The Matic NFT marketplace aims to connect and develop Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Matic seeks to create an ecosystem where users can leverage the various features offered by the Ethereum platform. Matic NFT later became Polygon. So, with an advantage of scalability at its core, how to build an NFT marketplace on Polygon?

How to build an NFT marketplace on Polygon?

Crypto marketplaces sprang up profusely due to the massive increase in NFTs. Due to its reputation as a blockchain network verified by Ethereum, Polygon took an active role in creating the Matic NFT marketplace. Having introduced the Matic NFT marketplace, let’s review how one can go about it. By providing security and reliability, the platform allows businesses to stand out. It will enable them to launch their NFT marketplaces with ease. It is also possible for users to customize the final product precisely to their needs.

Typical NFT marketplaces let users buy, sell, and view digital assets. Users can purchase assets at a fixed price or bid at an auction on this platform. An NFT marketplace on Polygon works in a similar context but on a secured technology with easy accessibility and multi-chain compatibility.

So if your objective is to build an NFT marketplace development on Polygon, then you need a Node.js app and a framework. Many NFT software solutions provide professional developers and customized support from a highly motivated staff if you are not a coding expert. It helps an NFT enthusiast, newbie, or an existing NFT business leverage developers to create a platform to build real-world applications. Although it is a time-consuming project that involves much effort from the developer and the user side, it is a straightforward way to get started with an NFT Marketplace — Polygon blockchain.

Despite how complex the process sounds, it is still not a hard rock to drill. Before worrying about cracking it all, the benefits could push you to make that next move.

Wouldn’t that be the best NFT marketplace development platform if it offers an efficacious, decentralized, highly secured, layer two solution user interface? Now that we have outlined the benefits, let’s rundown the Matic NFT marketplace development features.

The features of the NFT marketplace on Polygon

Scalability: Ability to perform multiple rapid and hassle-free transactions.

How To Build An Auction Marketplace On Cardano,"Today I am excited to launch the ADA Blobs smart contract marketplace on Cardano! This is the first auction NFT marketplace on the Cardano Blockchain and I will explain how it works in this Blob post.

The ADA Blobs project is entirely open source. You can follow along with the website source code as well as the Plutus source code. This Blob post will show you how to create an auction contract with Haskell and Plutus along with building an submitting transactions to the Cardano Blockchain with Javascript, the Cardano Serialization Library, and the Nami Wallet.

An adorable ADA Blob named Bob

Introduction

Cardano uses the extended UTxO model which is similar the UTxO model used by Bitcoin, but with the additional ability to add arbitrary data to the transactions.

UTxO stands for “Unspent Transaction Output” and works similarly to how you would pay with cash at a store. Let’s say you wanted to buy an adorable stuffed animal Blob for $10 at the toy store, but you only have a $20 bill. You would give the entire $20 bill to the cashier and they would give you back a $10 bill in change. Now lets say you similarly wanted to send someone 10 ADA (10₳) but you only have 1 UTxO in your Cardano wallet with 20₳ on it. The input to the transaction would be the UTxO with 20₳ and you would get back a UTxO with 10₳ in change.

The Bitcoin UTxO model

This model works well for sending and validating transaction on the blockchain but there is a fundamental limitation. We cannot create more complex transactions because we do not have access to additional additional blockchain data or programmable validators.

A vicious and aggressive ADA Blob named Yolg

The eUTxO Model

To solved this problem, the eUTxO model was developed for Cardano. This gives developers access to the Plutus language which allows them to create custom on-chain validators. Along with Plutus, the eUTxO model allows developers to attach data called datum to a transaction as well as supply data called the redeemer when a UTxO sitting at a script address is trying to be spent.

The example below showcases Bob sending funds to a script address and Yolg withdrawing those funds after a Plutus Validator evaluates to “true” for the transaction.

Bob sending funds to a Plutus script address

Yolg withdrawing funds from a script address

In the above example, Bob sends 40₳ to a script address. He supplies a 100₳ UTxO as input and instructs the output to be a 60₳ UTxO back to Bob as change and a 40₳ UTxO to the script address. Bob also supplies a datum called State 0. The Plutus Validator evaluates to true and the script is send 40₳.

Now Bob’s friend Yolg wants to withdraw some of the funds that Bob sent to the script address. Yolg creates a new transaction with the UTxO at the script address being used as input and the outputs are a UTxO with 20₳ to Yolg and another UTxO with 20₳ back to the script address. Yolg supplies a “Withdraw” redeemer and the datum on the output UTxO at the script transitions from State 0 to State 1.

A Plutus Validator will take in 3 inputs and return true or false. Validator(Datum, Redeemer, ScriptContext) = True. If the validator evaluates the true, the transaction succeeds. If not, the transaction fails.

A compressible ADA Blob named Glob

Creating the ADA Blobs Validator

To create the Plutus Auction Validator for ADA Blobs, we need to handle 3 possible user actions:

Starting a auction

Bidding on an auction

Closing an auction

Starting an Auction

To start an auction for a Blob NFT, we need to send our script address a UTxO with the Blob NFT along with a datum that will be used by the Plutus Validator to determine how others can bid on the Blob.

For example, if our datum has a minimum bid value and a bidder tries to bid less than that value, the bidder’s transaction will return false and fail.

Haskell data types for our Auction Datum

As you can see from above, our AuctionDatum will have 2 parts, an AuctionDetails and a Maybe BidDetails.

We want the auction details to always be the same throughout the auction so we will set the auction details when starting the auction. We won’t set the bid details yet as we will let the bidders set that value when they bid for our ADA Blobs.

Later in this Blob post I will show you how we can actually build the transaction off chain for starting an auction using Javascript the Cardano Serialization Library.

Bob starting an auction for a Blob NFT

Bidding on an Auction

Now that we have submitted a transaction to start our blob auction, we need to give others a way to bid on the auction.

The bidder will supply a new datum with their updated bid as well as a “Bid” redeemer (action) to spend the UTxO that exists at the script address. The validator script will than check to make sure the a bid is valid (larger than all other bids and the reserve amount) and that we set the next datum correctly (validating that the bidDetails data is the same as how much ₳ the bidder actually sent to the script address).

ADA Blobs Plutus Validator for the “Bid” redeemer

Glob bidding 100₳ for a Blob NFT

As an example lets say Glob bids 100₳ for the Blob NFT that Bob put up for auction. Now the script address has 101₳ and a Blob NFT.

Note: The extra 1₳ is because Cardano native tokens cannot be at a script address with no ₳. This is because then you would not be able to send the token because you would not be able to pay the Cardano Blockchain fees.

Yolg bidding 200₳ for a Blob NFT. This outbids Globs 100₳

Now Yolg comes along and wants to bid 200₳ for the Blob NFT. Yolg will send 200₳ to the script address, and 100₳ sitting at the script address will be returned to Glob.

We have to ensure with the bid transaction that if a bidder gets outbid, that their funds are correctly returned to them. All of this validation is performed in the bid section of the validator. The full source code contains additional helper functions for this process. You can follow along with the full Plutus source code here.

Closing an auction

After an auction is complete, anyone can close the auction which will send the bid funds to the seller, and the Blob NFT to the bidder. We require the “Close” Redeemer to close the auction. The validation for closing the auction includes code that ensures the auction deadline has passed. You can view the code for the close portion of the validator below.

ADA Blobs Plutus Validator for the “Close” redeemer

In our example, lets say the auction has closed. Yolg would get the Blob NFT and 1 ₳ at the script address and Bob would get the 200₳ at the script address.

Yolg gets 1₳ and the Blob NFT while Bob gets 200₳ when the auction closes

Building the Transactions with Javascript

Plutus is split up into On Chain and Off Chain code. The above contents address the On Chain validation code, but we still need to build the transactions and submit them to the Cardano Blockchain. While this project was being created, the Plutus Backend Application (PAB) had difficultly integrating with wallets. So instead of using Haskell to build the transactions that will be submitted to the Cardano Blockchain, ADA Blobs uses Javascript and the Cardano Serialization Library.

The code for constructing all 3 types of transactions can be found in this source code.

Building the Start Auction Transaction

In order to start our auction we need to construct our initial AuctionDatum, construct the desired outputs of the transaction, and select our input UTxOs that must contain the Blob NFT that we are intending to auction.

Typescript datatypes that matches the Haskell datatypes

We now need to take our typescript object and convert it into data that Plutus can understand. For that we need to use the Cardano Serialization Library. However, we need to add some custom functionality for it to work properly at the time of writing this. Originally SpaceBudz implemented a custom version of this library to build the transactions correctly. I copied their implementation here.

Cardano requires our data to be in a specific format in order to properly submit the transactions. I suggest reading this page on the Cardano Documentation in order to understand the JSON format that is required.

In my datum.ts file. I have commented the JSON structure that corresponds to the Haskell datatype that the function is trying to build. The easiest way to understand how to build the datum with the Cardano Serialization Library is the read the START_DATUM function I have created here.

JSON structure that will be submitted to the Cardano Blockchain for the Auction Datum Haskell datatype

A blobby ADA Blob named Oobby

With our Datum constructed we now need to create our desired outputs and select our input UTxOs. For our outputs we want to create a UTxO with a Blob NFT. Along with this, it is good practice at this time to include the datum as Metadata in the transaction so we can view it later in our bid off chain Javascript code. The below code constructs such an output.

Constructing the Start Auction output

Finally, we need to select our input UTxOs for the transaction. To do this we will use the random improve coin selection algorithm. I don’t want to get too technical into this algorithm here so I have provided a link to the algorithm from IOHK above. Essentially, the algorithm selects UTxOs in such a way that the outputs will allow future payments with a minimum number of inputs.

For ADA Blobs, I copied the algorithm implementation from SpaceBudz in the CoinSelection.ts file. I suggest copying this as well.

Finally with our datum, inputs, and outputs we can construct, sign, and submit the transaction.

Submitting our Auction Transaction!

Building the Bid Transaction

We will be building the bid transactions in a very similar way to the auction transactions. The differences occur in our bid transaction output and the requirement that we set a transaction time to live (ttl). For our output, if there is already an existing bid for our ADA Blob, we need send the previous bidder’s funds back to their address with the code below.

Paying back the previous bidder in our transaction outputs

We also need to set a validity start interval and time to live since bid validation will depend on the time that the bid transaction occurs.

Setting a validity start interval and ttl for our bid transaction

With this data set along with our updated datum, outputs, and inputs we can sign and submit our bid transaction!

Building the Close Transaction

We are almost done! We need to build our close transaction to give the highest bidder the ADA Blob NFT and the seller the highest bid. There is a case we also have to cover where nobody bids on the adorable pet Blob that is up for auction (but realistically that will never happen because they are so cute). For completeness however, we should include that in our “Close” code.

The close outputs which will give the bidder the Blob NFT and the seller the highest bid

The code above will give the highest bidder the adorable Blob NFT and the seller the highest bid amount. The “splitAmount” function you see there splits the output between the seller and the ADA Blobs marketplace fee which is 1%. The On Chain validation code takes this fee into account which you can see in the source code.

Along with the outputs we will need to set a time to live (ttl) for the Close transaction as well because the close transaction also depends on time.

Summary

After a few weeks of testing on the Cardano testnet and mainnet the ADA Blobs project is working perfectly! There are 300 adorable pet Blob NFTs that will be released 1 a week for the next 6 years. I’m excited to release this project and open source it to the community for everyone to learn from.

If you would like to join the Blob community, we’ve got a Discord Server and a Twitter for all your Blob needs.

Cardano projects are ramping up very quickly now and it is an exciting time to be a part of the community. Feel free to check out the ADA Blobs source code to use in your own projects!

Our top 5 web3 and NFT predictions for 2022,"The end of the year is here and therefore it’s the ultimate moment to look forward to what’s coming in cryptoland! Without further ado, let’s give you our top 5 predictions for web3 and NFT:

While web3 is all about the decentralized internet and “you” own web3, a lot of traditional companies will move their attention to web3 and how they can own it. Prime example is obviously Facebook, a company that even changed their name to Meta just for the sake to pretend they can own the metaverse (or at least sue every other company trying to use Meta in their name).

2. Brands, brands, brands

Since our target audience is brands, this is definitely a prediction we welcome with open arms. We predict that brands will become further active in the metaverse and that they will realize that NFTs are a perfect mean to do brand marketing. The Say solution is exactly answering this need for more utility and the creation of brand loyalty.

NFTs are a perfect mean to do brand marketing

3. NFT and metaverse will become the Instagram of brands

Consumers always look for the next big thing, and like they moved from Instagram to TikTok, we see further adoption of metaverses and buying of NFTs. Brands will put less effort in Instagram and will be present in these metaverses and NFTs. We believe the world will also be introduced to new, currently unknown, brands, that simply start as “NFT native”. Likewise with Instagram, you can place your bet that the Kardashians have soon their own personal NFT brand.

4. Owning an NFT will become a mean of digital identity

Owners of certain NFTs will come together based on the type of NFTs they own, and will create a group’s identity based on that. Call it a new form of social network where like on Facebook today you have specialized pages for practically every subject you can imagine. Well, these pages will turn to new metaverses.

5. Defi becomes more mature but also more regulated

Decentralized identity and on-chain KYC attestation services will play key roles in connecting users’ real identity with Defi wallet endpoints.",https://medium.com/@solsnakenft/our-top-5-web3-and-nft-predictions-for-2022-1830d293ed0e,[],2022-01-07 07:30:13.072000+00:00,"['Solana Network', 'Nft Marketplace', 'Nft Collectibles', 'Nftart', 'Nft']"
Investing in Music NFTs,"Blockchain technology is about to tip the scales of the music industry, shifting the power from intermediaries back to content artists and fans.

In 2021, the total revenue of the music industry amounted to 61.82 billion U.S. dollars. However, only 12% of that revenue goes to content artists as a significant portion of the profits are absorbed by intermediaries.

Furthermore, artists have minimal control over how their music is distributed and little visibility into who is streaming it. Please note that the exact figures vary across sources but the message is all but the same: The content artist is getting shafted!

Now add the blockchain revolution and you got yourself an industry that is ripe for disruption and innovation. New blockchain based platforms are launching weekly to help artists leverage NFTs, social tokens and DAO infrastructure to create new economic models around creativity and fan engagement.

The shape of music/Web3 tooling is more exciting and diverse than ever before.

Water & Music is an independent newsletter and research DAO, which is on a mission to empower music and entertainment professionals with the knowledge and network to do more collaborative, progressive and sustainable work with technology. Here is their market map of music/Web3 tools — which features nearly 80 different startups putting NFTs, social tokens, DAOs in a music- and creator-centric context.

If you love music and believe that blockchain technology is about to tip the scales of the music industry then you’d better get your spectacles out and examine this diagram very closely. For I have the feeling that there is some serious alpha to be found in some these of projects.

Cooper Turley would certainly agree. (Partly, one suspects, because he is invested in Audius but he makes a good case there nevertheless.)

I have found Water & Music’s market map of music/Web3 tools fairly insightful and subsequently zoomed in on a few projects that I find very interesting.

So here are my list of top music projects that I will keep my eyes on in 2022:

What is Opulous?

Opulous brings DeFi to the music industry, providing a launchpad for the first music copyright-backed NFTs as well as DeFi loans that will change how artists access the funding they need.

The platform comprises three main functions:

NFT Launchpad

NFT Exchange

DeFi Loans

Opulous Music NFTs are a new form of Non-Fungible Token, offering buyers a share of a song’s future royalty earnings and exclusive rewards in exchange for social media support.

Opulous peer-to-peer DeFi loans to cut out traditional banks, middle-men and major labels, allowing artists to access up-front cash based on the predictable royalties they generate over 12 months.

What about market viability?

According to Opulous, its project is a music industry first, with no direct competitors and only a small number of other projects occupying the same space. Unlike most other blockchain projects, Opulous is based on real-world music assets with stable and predictable value.

The $OPUL token can be used to receive special discounts across the platform and token holders will also get exclusive access to major NFT drops.

Opulous founder Lee Parsons is also the CEO of global music distribution platform Ditto Music. This partnership will introduce the platform to over 500.000 musicians worldwide from launch (nice synergy here — love it).

You will find all the investor information here.

Here is Lee Parsons explaining how Opulous works:

I was feverishly rummaging through YouTube in search of confirmation bias and I came across CoachK. As you can see I had to dig deep in the influencer box to find this guy. In fairness, I think I saw him once featured on Crypto Banter and the points that he makes are excellent.

To be sure Opulous is definitely not featured on Real Vision Crypto (yet), nor has it been the talk of the town in the influencer circle — heck the Coin Bureau hasn’t even covered it yet (and that says something). At #522 and a market cap of $83 million is still considered a ‘small-cap crypto’ project otherwise known as ‘penny crypto’. So definatetly #DYOR and above all don’t bet your EtherRock NFT on it just yet.

However, being relatively unknown means that it has yet to be discovered, which leads me to conclude that the upside on this token cannot be ignored. Fundamental analysis reveals a solid project. Opulous solves a real problem and I love the team. Lee Parsons has been in the trenches and appears to be on the ball. There are definitely some nice synergies going on with Ditto Music.

Their idea of Music NFTs, which offers fans a share of a song’s future royalty earnings and exclusive rewards in exchange for social media support, are a game changer. Speaking of which, I’d love me an NFT piece of Pātea Māori Club — who wouldn’t?

Please note that Opulous isn’t alone in its space, either: competitors with a similar take include Royal, Royalty Exchange and SongVest, all of which appear to be marketplaces for music NFTs, allowing users to purchase shares of songs then earn royalties on the music they’ve invested in. #DYOR at your own convenience. *Royal and Royalty Exchange do not have a token yet, while SongVest does not appear to be a blockchain based project at all.

Next up we will take a look at Audius, which is fairly well known among the crypto community.

What is Audius?

In a nutshell, Audius is like Spotify or SoundCloud, but on the blockchain with a social media component.

Founded in 2018, Audius is a decentralized music streaming service that lets artists upload their tunes to the app and connects fans directly with artists and exclusive new music.

It was originally built on POA Network, an Ethereum sidechain, and later moved parts of its service to the Solana blockchain. Developers can build their own apps on top of Audius, giving them access to a unique audio catalogue.

According to Decrypt, Audius is one of the largest non-financial crypto applications, which is owned and run by an open-source community of artists, fans, and developers. It passed more than 5.55 million unique users in December 2021, jumping from 2.9 million unique users in January 2021.

At first sight, Audius definitely seems like a nifty project to consider in your crypto portfolio. For context, Audius is basically a censorship resistant SoundCloud and this in and of itself should be mouthwatering for any crypto enthusiast. What’s more is that TikTok has picked Audius to power their new ‘Sounds’ library. Bullish sign indeed!

Their market cap is still under $1 billion and it has yet to break into the top 100 market cap rank so there is certainly plenty of upside for this little gem.

Again, I was going through YouTube in search of confirmation bias and this time it was much easier to find related content. Real Vision Crypto, Unchained Podcast, even the Coin Bureau are all onto the Audius trail. Here is an interesting interview I have stumbled across by Jason Calacanis and Audius co-founder Roneil Rumburg.

*As you may know (or not) I am a big fan of Jason Calacanis. He also features in the All-In Podcast with Chamath Palihapitiya, David Sacks & David Friedberg, which covers all things economic, tech, political, social & poker. This is a must for every investment connoisseur.

So far so good — great interview. Audius this, Audius that — everything is peaches and cream up until the 57th minute where Jason summarizes:

So there is an unknown organization in Panama which we don’t know who’s on it that controls $450.000.000 worth of tokens.

Wait a minute so we have Panama, crypto, $450 milion, and nobody knows who owns it because of “security” reasons? Please do me a favour and listen to it for yourself. (You can find it at the 57:15 minute mark.) This revelation caught me off guard and at this point I have to seriously wonder whether I am the only one who thinks that this is dodgy as f*ck? I am still learning myself so maybe I am overanalyzing this — what are your thoughts?

A little red flag here but let’s keep it rolling. Let’s consider the founding team behind Audius. The Audius site lists Roneil Rumburg and Forrest Browning as Co-founders. Fair enough but who the f*ck is Ranidu Lankage?

So it appears that Ranidu Lankage was also part of the team until he wasn’t. Is he the whale in Panama who controls a significant amount of tokens? Fair enough, sometimes things don’t work out and that is okay. A little transparency would be useful as the founding team is a critical matric when evaluating a crypto project.

The ball doesn’t stop there though. The Audius protocol has also been altered over time. The earlier version used a protocol token called Loud. See for yourself: This is the 2019 whitepaper and this is the 2020 whitepaper. I have made a diagram for side by side comparison.

All in all, I believe that a little transparency is in order. Clearly, Ranidu Lankage was given the boot or whatever and some changes were made to the protocol. This in and of itself is okay but be upfront about it. Isn’t that a fundamental pillar of the blockchain revolution — transparency? It is like farting rather loudly on your first date and then pretending nothing happened!

Overall, Audius’ credibility is very low in my books and as such I will not be participating in a potential Audius craze. Aside from the bizarre tokenomics and all the skeletons in their closet, I still fancy the token to get a fair bit of a pump. As such I am in a bit of a dilemma and have accordingly decided to invest $50 bucks into Audius. If it does pump to the moon I will be taking my wife and daughter out to Sizzler.

Last but not least I would like to tell you about Rally, which has caught my eyes for some time now.

In short, Rally is an Ethereum token that powers the Rally network. Rally enables creators and online communities to launch their own cryptocurrencies. By creating these so-called “social tokens,” fans can gain access to benefits like unreleased content or merchandise, while creators can unlock new forms of revenue.

I have first come across the Rally token in Real Vision Crypto’s 4 part special called ‘Hugh Hendry: The new economy of community tokens’.

In this particular episode Real Vision Crypto senior editor Ash Bennington welcomes Kevin Chou, founder & CEO of Rally, and Hugh Hendry to discuss how Rally is using tokenization to create an ecosystem for content creators. From live music to gaming, Rally is building a community of various content creators who are chosen and vetted by Rally token holders democratically. Chou, Hendry, and Bennington dive into the intricacies of the Rally network and how Chou’s background in gaming shaped its creation.

*You definitely might have to print out the transcript for this one — Hugh Hendry’s accent is hard yakka!

Please watch this interview if you want to find out more about the Rally token. Suffice to say is that I strongly believe that 2022 we will see an increasing trend in the monitization of communities. Rally in particular enables digital entrepreneurs, crypto influencers, brands, and celebrities to create better engagement and monetization opportunities within their communities without depending on any individual social media platform.

In summary, many people dismiss NFTs as expensive JPEG’s. But that’s not all they are. Nearly anything that can use unique identifiers can benefit from NFT technology. Not only for digital ownership, but digital access, digital community and digital identity.

Blockworks rightly points out that participants in the Metaverse can use NFTs for real estate, clothing and personalization. DAOs can use NFTs to mark specific roles for members to occupy, or even just to signal group membership in a personal way.

And music in particular, as both an art form and a business, is being completely reimagined by NFTs. Put on your thinking cap and be in it from the beginning. It makes sense to me and I can see it loud and clear. Here is Water & Music’s market map of music/Web3 tools again. Which project has caught your eyes?

I like me some Opulous, Royal, and Rally. To be sure it’s a trend that has caught the eye of many musicians, who see it not only as a new revenue stream but also a way to bring passion and excitement back to the relationship between their fans and their industry.

Royal, for example, just garnered $55 million in a Series A round that included support from Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z crypto fund, Coinbase, and rappers Nas and Joyner Lucas.

Audius too might be worth a closer look but I don’t vibe with their shady behind the scenes business and lack of transparency. That said I am keeping an open mind and will be following their progress or lack thereof. Enough said!

This will be my last post for the year of 2021 (I promise). What an amazing ride! For those of you who have subscribed to my newsletter and have actually read this far a sincere thank you! I have initially started writing just for my own learning and my readership didn’t extend beyond my wife. To my surprise I have 40+ subscribers. Amazing and thank you for your vote of confidence!

Last Words of 2021,"It’s a cold and sunless afternoon in the desert. Happy belated Christmas to you all. I hope you had a nice holiday with whoever you celebrate with. And if you don’t celebrate, then I hope you had a good Saturday.

Today is one of those days that remind me of different points in my life. I’m eating ham and leftover curry rice. I’ve gained a few pounds since December’s started, but staying committed to good healthy eating while it’s so cold outside is something I haven’t yet conquered.

The first point reminds me of my 23rd birthday in Chicago. If you know anything about Chicago, it should be that no one not from Chicago typically chooses to spend their February birthday in Chicago. Yet there I was.

I made a wine bottle my company for the weekend as I visited a Black Panther history exhibit, Sue at the Field Museum, the frozen lake, and went on short walks through the neighborhood I stayed in (Bronzeville). There was even a bridge a short distance away that I’d walk to in the morning to get a great (free) view of the Chicago skyline. I concluded that weekend enjoying a birthday dinner with a good friend and leaving with thoughts that I could one day make Chicago my home. That has yet to come into fruition, and the likelihood has since decreased (as I complain about the winter in Arizona) but I still romanticize the idea of it. Early-mid 40s seem like a good age to spend in a tough American city.

I won’t tell you the second point yet.

What I will tell you, however, is that coming January 1st, the Studio Jali Instagram will become active. There’s nothing there yet, but if you want to go give it a follow/check it out it’s @studio.jali

I also finished the logo this weekend.

If you don’t know what Studio Jali is, it’s my film studio. We’re releasing our first project in April 2022. Any other questions you have will (probably) be answered after the first few Instagram post. It’s an exciting time.

Also, since I won’t talk to you until the new year, I’ll share some of my goals (aka resolutions) now.

I ) Get a manager.

II) Get the @studio.jali Instagram to 500 followers by April 20th, 2022.

III) Move back to LA.

That’s all from me this week.

See you next year,

Benefits of the Dreamy Lip Mask,"Dear Baddies,

We hope you are having a good start to your week. We can’t believe it’s almost New Years. Where did the time go?! As we embrace winter, we wanted to talk about the benefits of lip masks, specifically our Dreamy Lip Mask.

No matter the instance, we’ve all likely noticed that our lips can be super sensitive. Did you know our lip structure differs from other skin structures on our bodies. We have three main layers of skin which consists of:

the epidermis (stratum corneum) which is the outer protective layer

the dermis which contains hair follicles, sweat glands, and connective tissue

the hypodermis (deeper subcutaneous tissue) which is the internal skin layer and is made of fat and connective tissue

While our lips do have three layers of skin the top layer, epidermis, is A LOT thinner. Baddies, did you know the reason our lips give off a red tint is because the epidermis is so thin our blood vessels show through the thin layer!

Our lips middle layer, the dermis, is also thinner so your lips aren’t able to produce as much melanin. Because of this, your lips can burn easier and you are more likely to get sun damage.

Also, your lips do not have sweat glands so they obviously do not sweat. Honestly thank god..lol. However, since there are no sweat glands our lips get dry and chapped much easier than the rest of our bodies.

Since your lips are more sensitive and prone to damage, taking proper care of them is vital to the longevity of your lips. Applying a lip mask daily will help reduce dryness and will keep them moisturized throughout your day. Our lip mask includes ingredients that contain a variety of benefits and ones that moisturize your lips.

Tocopherol, which you probably know as Vitamin E, has many health benefits. Vitamin E is one main ingredient in our lip mask and it helps to strengthen your skin’s barrier. So when you choose lip care with Vitamin E, your lips can stay fuller and more youthful-looking for longer. Vitamin E is fat-soluble, which means it has the ability to dive deep down into your skin and preserve the lipids (fats) in your lips. This makes Vitamin E a great hydrator, it seals moisture inside your lips while aiding in slowing down dehydration. Vitamin E can also help close up any painful cracks that are caused by dryness and cold weather.

Price sensitivity. How to find the sweet spot?,"Price sensitivity. How to find the sweet spot?

Price sensitivity is a well-known topic for both offline and online stores. Even if you have never paid attention to it before, we are sure that you have noticed it while running your business. Modvise Dec 30, 2021·3 min read

Why price sensitivity is so important

When thinking of increasing sales, there are many aspects to consider. But one of the most important points, besides the quality and appearance of the goods, is the price adjustment. Price sensitivity is directly related to the elasticity of demand. Prices have an essential impact if sales go up or down. That is why it is so crucial to set the best possible price, especially when dealing with a price-sensitive customer. If the price is too high, customers may simply refuse to buy your product.

Of course, some products or product segments do not need a price-sensitive approach. But for price-sensitive consumers, it is best to use different pricing strategies to get the expected impact on their shopping decisions.

Understanding the price sensitivity of your service or product allows you to be aware of how changes may impact purchasing behavior of your clients. Knowledge about sensitivity will allow you to set the best price ranges possible and maximize your business profit or sales volume.

Most fundamental factors

The most fundamental factors for the price sensitivity of a service or product are:

Geography — when adjusting prices, consider the region you want to sell. For example, if you plan to sell in India at a high price point, that would not be as profitable because Indians are more sensitive to prices. However, in Europe, you can charge more for products even though the quality remains unchanged from what was originally offered.

For example, if you plan to sell in India at a high price point, that would not be as profitable because Indians are more sensitive to prices. However, in Europe, you can charge more for products even though the quality remains unchanged from what was originally offered. Economics — the current economic situation of customers and the market. You can not be separated from the current status quo when setting prices.

— the best example is Apple and its product lines. They can highly overprice their goods as there is a massive endorsement for the brand. Necessities —think about the position of your brand and products in the context of the target group you want to reach. The prices of basic consumer goods are much more price-sensitive than luxury items due to the share of net income that consumers can spend. Products that absorb most of the regular budget spending tend to have more elastic demand.

Price sensitivity in your pricing and marketing strategy

All of the factors mentioned above are directly related to every aspect of marketing activities and can help improve your business decisions. Knowing exactly what factors have the biggest impact on the price elasticity of your products or services is key to understanding your pricing correctly in relation to the profile of your customers. However, lowering the price to increase sales is not always the most effective move, as it depends on the product itself. Think of branded goods that are seen as “special”, “exclusive” or “premium”. Applying price cuts to such products can lead to opposite feelings and damage consumer perception of the brand.

Another thing to keep in mind is that once you lower a price, it is hard to raise it again. Thus, applying short-term price adjustments such as promotional discounts or coupons gives much more flexibility.

Even better solutions are all kinds of loyalty promotions and discounts for a given action, such as membership or signing up for a newsletter.

Starting a business while you are employed in the UAE,"Are you a full-time working employee thinking about starting your own business in the UAE? If so, you are not alone. Around 50% of the people residing in the UAE prefer to start a new business with a full-time job that pays a regular salary and benefits in the background. A stable, dependable source of income will give you the confidence in testing the waters with a new business that has a higher likelihood of failure in the first year. According to Google, the world searched for how to start a business more than how to get a job in 2021. The UAE and in particular Dubai as a city is making an immense effort to make it the most favourable place in the world to open a business.

What are the requirements to start a business while you are employed? Well, there are a few options;

Getting a No Objection Letter (NOC) from the current company is the mandatory requirement if you are planning a mainland company setup.

Steps to get a NOC from the working company:

1. File a request visa Dubai Trade Portal

2. Submit the below-mentioned documents

– Copy of passport, company’s name reservation, AOA and MOA

– Bank or cash guarantee of AED 50,000

– Undertaking letter signed by the UAE partner

3. Pay AED 500 as NOC issuance fee

4. Get approval from DED

After the NOC is received you need to save this on the company’s records.

If you are unable to get this NOC, you can still start your business in the UAE either by forming a company on the name of spouse and naming them as Managing Director or you can start with free trade zones that do not require a NOC from employees.

A Pocket Guide To Finding Your Instagram Target Audience,"Find Instagram Target Audience

Having in-depth knowledge of your Instagram target audience is an important part of a successful Instagram marketing strategy.

Know your audience and what they want!

You need to CLEARLY understand how your service/product make your audiences live:

➡️ Better

➡️ Easier

➡️ More interesting

2. You also need to know how you can add value to your audience with Social Media.

Here are questions that will help get the answer:

➡️ What holds your audience back from purchasing, and how can you help them get over that?

➡️ Where are your followers in their buying journey? Are they researching or ready to buy now?

➡️ What kind of content does your audience engage with the most?

3. When speaking to your audience, keep in mind their:

➡️ Age range

➡️ Location (time zone)

➡️ Language

➡️ Income

➡️ Spending habits

➡️ Interests

➡️ Challenges

➡️ Stage of life

4. Talk directly to them. Think of one specific person and talk to THEM.

➡️ Creating your content with one person in mind really helps your audience feel like you’re speaking directly to THEM.

➡️ It’s easier to create a post or caption with someone in mind that you want to help.

🔥 The more specific you get with your posts and captions, the easier it will be for your target audience to find you, AND BUY FROM YOU.

DON’T worry about losing followers when you’re getting more specific with your target audience.

❌ You don’t want followers that aren’t going to buy from you anyway!

Instagram Story Viewer Algorithm: What Does It Mean for Business Accounts?,"Instagram (IG) is a great medium for businesses to reach out to their potential customers. Over the years, the platform has emerged as a magnificent marketing tool for brands with various features that can be used to increase interaction between the users and the viewers. One such tool is Instagram stories — upload quick, snackable content and in a short span of 15 seconds, brands can engage the audiences in a number of interactive content that remains up and running for 24 hours and the select few can be placed in the ‘Highlights’ section in the profile for audiences to discover later. Whether it is a standalone image or a short video, or combined with features like quizzes, polls, and emoji sliders, IG stories engage the viewers wonderfully. The platform also generates a list of story viewers, a set of information that can be very useful for brands and businesses. Read on to know how the Instagram story viewer algorithm works.

Organic Reach of Instagram Stories

Creator and business accounts are also powered by the capability to boost or run ads on stories, which means they have the choice to decide what content reaches which segment of target audiences. But, when it comes to the organic reach of content, Instagram’s story viewer algorithm plays a substantial role.

We will start with the technicalities. Instagram’s algorithm as a whole prioritises relevant and recent content for the users to view. That remains for stories as well. The stories users see first are based on their past consumption behaviour, which means the accounts that they frequently visit will show up first in line, in the horizontal story listing on the app. On the other side of the screen, the one that brands are in, the platform provides a list of users who have viewed your content. While it is great to know that a has performed well, and has organically reached a number of accounts, the question arises if the list is just a random consolidation of people who have viewed the content or are they constant followers who have interacted most with the brand’s content. Is the name that one sees at the top of the list the ultimate follower? To find the answer, let us elaborate on how Instagram story viewer rankings work.

Instagram Stories Viewer Rankings

Instagram’s algorithm uses a number of data points to identify the best content for the users. The platform’s story viewer algorithm is no different in that manner and story views ranking is majorly based on three elements — the interest of the story viewer, the recency of the posts, and the regularity of your interaction with the viewer. Of course, the first two are tackled by maintaining a healthy frequency of posting stories. But the third one needs more attention for businesses to make the most out of Instagram Stories. Let us help understand how it works.

A user who has been ranked higher on the list of your story viewer list doesn’t necessarily be your ultimate follower or the one who has viewed your story first! Instagram’s algorithm becomes a little tricky here. Before a story reaches 50 viewers, the algorithm organises the list chronologically. But once the viewership crosses that mark, the whole game changes. The algorithm shows results based on the user’s past behaviour instead of the viewer’s. It prioritizes the relationship that a user shares with the viewer. If a user has engaged with a particular account more, chances are that profile will be ranked higher in the views lists. These are the accounts that users interact with the most. The vice-versa may also be true but Instagram has not claimed any such thing officially.

Business Account Instagram Stories View Ranking

While it is understood that Instagram story viewer rankings are based on the user affinity of content, what does it mean when it is a business account? The accounts showing up in the views lists may or may not be the ones that the brand had searched for, interacted with, or followed. Instead, these are the ones who tapped, shared, replied, visited the profile, followed, or simply viewed the entire story instead of navigating away from it. Instagram’s algorithm kicks right in, recognizes this, and organises the news list accordingly. For a brand running a business account on Instagram, this means, that these are the people who are interested in what the brand has to say. The views list can be the cue for brands to create future content — it gives an understanding of what’s working and what’s not. It will also help in identifying the content consumption pattern of the target audience and brands can develop strategies that can help their business grow.

11 Best Ways To Apply For Study Abroad Programs — Real Update,"You’ve finally decided to study abroad and become an international student. All that remains is for you to complete your research and apply to institutions. Do you continually put off starting the process because you’re afraid?

Applying to a university in Europe, such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, or Sweden, or in the United States, China, or elsewhere, is not as difficult as you would imagine. All you have to do now is pay attention to a few specifics and get all of the required documents ready as quickly as possible.

It’s never too early to begin thinking about going abroad to study. Evaluate your professional and occupational goals, look into program possibilities, go over eligibility, look into finance options, and keep track of critical dates.

The application process for university admission varies by country, and there is no one-size-fits-all formula for gaining admission to your preferred institution. However, there are some general guidelines to follow as well as some pointers that can assist you in gaining admission.

1. Decide on a program

Decide where you want to study abroad, what level and the subject of study you want to pursue, and whether you have the necessary academic credentials. Consider your work opportunities before deciding on a specialization in a field. Choose a program that aligns with your objectives, and try to attend a top-ranked university.

has a good reputation in your desired field, or fits other crucial criteria for you.

2. Critically read the policy and timelines.

Assessing the prerequisites is the first move in enrolling in a school overseas. Seek further details from the institutions if the material on the webpage is unclear or inadequate. If you’re not sure whether your country is allowed for visa applications in the country, check officially recognized websites and study authorities. It’s critical to keep track of deadlines so that you don’t miss the admissions or entrance exam deadlines.

3. Compose a statement of purpose for yourself.

A motivation letter is required when applying to particular fields of study or schools. The motivation letter or cover letter should demonstrate your ability to succeed at the university and should include an assessment of your abilities as well as your qualifications.

achievements. So, in a clean and organized motivation letter, describe your desire in attending the university, and ensure to write in good English.

4. Request a letter of recommendation.

Enrollment to an institution or program may need one or more instructor letters of recommendation. Don’t be afraid to approach your teachers for letters of recommendation if you have a fantastic relationship with them. Instructors should keep in mind that recommendation letters take time to write, and they may be asked for letters from many students.

Inquire as soon as possible to guarantee that they will have time to produce a thorough and persuasive recommendation.

5. Study for the TOEFL or IELTS exam.

If you want to study abroad and your first language isn’t English, you’ll almost certainly need to take an English language test. When it comes to arranging your study abroad schedule and scheduling your test,

Consider how much time you’ll need to prepare for the test. You’ll need time for studying and preparation for the examination based on your English language competency and capability to use the English language, and also the grade that the institution demands.

Also, remember to schedule the test at least two months ahead, as each testing facility only offers exams four times per month, based on regional demand. It’s possible that if you register late, it will be filled.

6. Verify and transcribe your documents

If you want to study in an English-taught program in another country, you’ll need to translate your documentation (including your diploma and grades) into English. Keep in mind that the translations should be confirmed by a third party. If you’re unsure about which authority your desired university accepts, check their website or ask an admissions official.

7. Take advantage of the online mobile applications

To make it much easier for people to study for courses, many colleges are now using an online registration portal. Most schools and students choose to send digital documents rather than by mail because it is quicker and frequently less costly or independent.

8. Fill out an application for the admission exam.

Various regions, such as India, and some schools, such as medical schools, offer standardized tests that assess your basic science expertise as well as abilities in disciplines such as language proficiency and academic performance. Check the examination date and location, as the exam is normally held one or two months before the institution’s opening day. You’ll enroll for the test ahead of time and, if necessary, make travel arrangements for your trip abroad. Also, make sure you understand what to expect on the day of the test. Examine a sample test if at all possible.

9. Be self-assured during the interview.

An admission interview could be the final step in the application process. Some colleges, such as the University of Oxford and select elite programs, conduct interviews to determine whether individuals are the best fit for admission. The interview normally begins with a discussion of why you want to study at this school or program, as well as your background and future aspirations. Prepare for the interview, be confident, and don’t be intimidated by the formal environment. Maintain a calm demeanor and avoid speaking too hastily or slowly.

10. Make an appointment for your visa.

Your institution and curriculum must be accredited by the authorities of the nation where they are based to become eligible for a study permit. It’s usually time to sign up for a study visa when you obtain a letter of admission and are enrolled in the institution.

Requesting for a study permit can be a long and frustrating procedure, according to the nation’s requirements and the percentage of students. As a result, it’s advisable to take for your study permit as early as possible and book your consultation or assessment. A financial statement, the registration form, the cash payment for your request and community college tuition cost, your visa, and heath and biographical data are normally required for a visa application.

11. Create a budget.

You should include in expenditures for the school’s admission exam, interpreting documents, scheduling an English written exam, university tuition, and passport application fees when enrolling in institutions overseas. Don’t let this deter you; many students study abroad on a shoestring budget; nonetheless, you should prepare ahead for your expected costs so that you can budget accordingly.",https://medium.com/@realupdatez1/11-best-ways-to-apply-for-study-abroad-programs-real-update-8a27db2aae0c,"['Scholarship', 'Job Opportunities Abroad']",2022-01-18 12:12:09.124000+00:00,"['Scholarship Program', 'Study Abroad', 'Study In Canada']"

Social media isn’t killing as much as smoking,"Only if you know how to use and get the most of it.

This article is about how your online, mostly social media activities pay off from the perspective of content marketing.

A big alert: this article is about and dedicated to people who have professional, creative skills.

After using social media for more than 10 years at both personal and professional levels and roasting it enough, I’ve realized that one’s online activities — what content you produce, what you put out there bring lots of opportunities.

Having said that, I must say everyone should switch their social media usage from personal to professional, and actually show off their professions.

The first question is, why? Secondly, how?

PS: I’ve posted examples more from TikTok, but it doesn’t mean this article is only about TikTok usage.

Now, hold my beer.

Opportunities come anywhere

You never know.

I know some people got jobs because of their Twitter and Facebook activities. One of them was famous on Twitter, had funny tweets full of puns, and had a good amount of followers. He became a copywriter, he’s now a creative director at a local advertising company.

The other one, my close friend, was writing his daily story-type posts on Facebook. He also got a job as a copywriter at a digital marketing company, without academic background or diploma. He told me that, as he was writing a lot, he realized that creative writing resonates with his interests; he worked on himself and earned Adobe certificates as well. I wrote about him here.

They were good at writing, and by intention or not, they got to show their skills on social media. Or, to put it another way, they were using social media with their creative writing skills, and got the attention.

Also, I observe and know for myself, the more you become active on social media, you get better at improving your skills (for the sake of improving your content continuously) and get new ideas from others.

Lots of people have skills, creative souls, some valuable information and skill to share on the Internet yet, they don’t. They act like consumers, not creators — producers.

Millions of consumers — any type, any age

Another example is what I just came across on TikTok. A forster family of 12 with 10 children; the mother shares how she prepares meals for them on this clip:

Simple, yet interesting. She shares her family, tips on how she manages everything, and gets the interest of millions of people.

The Dougherty Dozen family also has their single page site, where they’ve put affiliate links, what products they’re using, wish lists, their Amazon store, and much more.

That is a win-win situation for both creators and consumers. Consumers are fed their hunger for entertainment and they learn something while creators get views, customers, and make money.

How did these people become successful? They’ve found what they are capable of creating and producing, their content style, a fitting platform, and got a creative way to sell — earn money.

Think of Carrie Bradshaw at the HBO’s TV series “Sex And The City”. It’s said she knows fashion, relationships, and sex. She was good at observations, even if her opinions were wrong most of the time (for me). Carrie was good at converting her thinking into words — that’s what she was doing — writing a sex column in a newspaper and getting paid, not to mention later on she became a writer at VOGUE Magazine and published her books. This might not only be fiction.

As this lady — she’s an astrologist, as she said, she HELPS PEOPLE FIGURE OUT THEMSELVES. She’s active on both Instagram and Twitter. She’s writing a column at magazines like Cosmopolitan, Vice, and Bustle.

As she said, she is internet popular. The companies she’s working with found out about her through her activities on Instagram and Twitter.

When TikTok came out, I was super skeptical, had a biased opinion; I was a total judgemental b*tch. I was like eww, screw them, I’d never register and use it.

Today I’m praising the content creators across all social media platforms (not the ones that share their sugar daddy issues).

For professional purposes only (I swear!) I started using TikTok, exploring what type of content is produced on the platform.

I’ve been through every type of account, binge-watched thousands of clips. Lots of content was/is trash and nonsense. But, it was enlightening, I was like: “you guys are getting paid for that?”

Business owners, influencers, travelers, motivational speakers, psychologists, life coaches, astrologists, anyone with any profession is using TikTok for their own good. And people are falling for their content, not to mention the platform is addictive as well.

Content is the GOAT marketing

People like to search everything, find an answer to their questions online, or content to feed their boredom, entertainment, or curiosity.

Got a headache? Google it (it’ll probably show the possibility of cancer, but still), just broke up with your BF/GF, or wonder why your cat keeps his tongue out? Ask Google why? Got bored? Ask Google top ten movies to watch. You’re sad? Search for funny animal videos. And more and forth.

These types of content get thousands of traffic on every platform.

Them — you may have some great skills, but if no one knows about it, you’ll not be able to benefit from it, and even worse, you may lose interest in improving yourself and the skills you now have.

Can you be one of these content producers?

Start blogging..

If you love writing and if you can deliver your value through it. I was thinking that reading blogs was dead since I hadn’t come across a blog that I could remember or visit the second time.

I was wrong. I found Harry Dry’s blog — Marketing Examples. It’s one of the blogs that I’ve subscribed to and read continuously, and somehow it happens I’m talking about his blog a lot and recommend it to everyone. Why? He delivers value, and his examples are applicable and straight to the point. Harry has his own style. He doesn’t write 3000-word long articles, he even has a short, 7-sentence long article. He got the point.

How to have a successful blog?

Write what you know and can;

Don’t copy what others do in your industry, it’s boring, and they may be wrong;

Get out of the box and forget about the writing rules, that’s your blog — write whatever and however you want;

Make sure you help people and deliver value;

Don’t be shy to voice your style through your content.

And,

Don’t forget about SEO.

You can also post your content on related communities like Reddit, Indie Hackers, etc. to get started, improve your writing skills and get more experience.

On social media platforms..

Don’t interrupt the experience of users. Be their experience.

On Facebook, be a good storyteller for people that they’ll love to share your story; on Instagram, be an artist; on TikTok, be a real TikToker, use those trendy songs on your clips; on Youtube, be a teacher/mentor/coach; on LinkedIn, act like professional.

Read my other article about social media for business.

Online communities. Share valuable information you’ve got related to your interest and skills. Make e-friends, grow your social and business network from the communities you have an interest in (Quora, Reddit, Facebook groups, etc). This will help you later with publishing and/or promoting your content there. In general, grow your professional network, for it brings countless business opportunities.

About deciding on your content

Look closer at your lifestyle, what you’re good at or what you like doing the most. Watching movies? Painting? Traveling? Following fashion? Hiking? Cooking? Taking care of pets? I can ask more questions but you got the point.

Now, think of what people can learn from your profession, daily activities, or your skills (any).

This guy is a psychologist. Play, you’ll see what I mean:

Produce your main content on the platform that works best for you — represents your profession, and don’t stop being active on others too.

Disclaimer: I’m not promoting or praising the social media users that produce lip singing or mukbang types of sh!!ty content. I’m on the side of the ones that give real value and help others in any way.

Don’t just produce content that people will watch but don’t get value. Though you will make money somehow, you’ll not deliver value. It’s just the ethics. Up to you. Otherwise, you’ll have no difference from smoking companies that poison the consumers.

Don’t do this:

Or, this:

Do this:

And this:

About the “don’ts” I mentioned above: they make social media entertaining, but they are also cause people being couch potatoes. Just a note.

What comes next?

You already know what having a huge followers list and fan base means.

https://media.giphy.com/media/1lDfEnjowuVcpMRozp/giphy.gif

If you’re your own product, you’ll attract customers;

You can earn with referral and affiliate marketing;

You can get paid for views and likes on social media (like TikTok);

If you create your product, you’ll promote it quickly at no cost.

Conclusion

We can all agree that social media offers a lot, and there’s a huge opportunity for everyone to get known, “discovered”, and paid.

I can tell that social media is the easiest way to make a living from your side hustle, hobby, or interest — whatever you name it.

It’s not rocket science.

If you scroll the content only and be that couch potato, you’ll get consumed by social media. The key is — create your own story, be an active and professional Internet user, and convert your creative skills into perfect content.

As it’s all in the essence of all business types — you need to help, give value, and satisfy consumers, doesn’t matter what your “product” is.

A big takeaway is: don’t be a content consumer, but a producer if you want to benefit from social media and don’t want to let it harm you.",https://blog.uvodo.com/social-media-isnt-killing-as-much-as-smoking-3bddc234ac7b,['Narmina Balabayli'],2022-01-05 10:51:01.053000+00:00,"['Content Creation', 'Social Media Marketing', 'Content Marketing', 'Internet Marketing', 'Social Media']"
How to Climb Out of Poverty,"If we reason sensibly, how can an ordinary man born in a slum get rich? We will not consider the criminal way, nor will we consider beautiful stories about millionaires. So, reasoning based on common sense will get you nowhere. Then what good is common sense to you? Why settle for common sense? Just allow yourself to do what seems impossible.

By acting logically, people get the appropriate result. If one is born into poverty, one is surrounded by poverty, accustomed to it, and attuned to emitting energy at the frequency of one’s poverty line. It is very difficult to readjust to the line of one’s affluence if one has only hatred of one’s poverty, envy of the rich, and a desire to become affluent oneself. Or no, I would say that with only these three things in place, it is almost impossible to switch to the line of wealth.

Let’s look into why. Probably one of the first discoveries of all children entering life is this fact: Just because you don’t want something doesn’t mean you’ll be spared it. Sometimes a cry of despair just bursts out of your soul: “But I don’t want it! I just hate it! Why won’t it leave me alone? Why does this always happen to me?” Such a question in a fit of indignation ask themselves not only children, but adults as well. Indeed, it is difficult to accept the situation that if you do not want something, it still happens, and if you hate it, it just persists. You can hate your poverty, your job, your physical defects, your neighbors, vagrants in the street, alcoholics, drug addicts, dogs, thieves, bandits, insolent youths, the government… The more you hate it, the more it comes across in life. It hurts you, you think about it, and so you continue to be in a line of poverty where the object of your discontent is present in abundance. And here it doesn’t matter what polarity this emission has: “like” or “dislike. The second is even more effective, because negative emotions are stronger. Can you imagine how many harmful factors are inherent in a negative attitude toward life?

Let’s go back to the man born into poverty. He has a dream of becoming rich. But one wish, as you know, does not change anything. You can collapse on the couch and lazily pull: “It would be nice to sunbathe on the beach right now, but it’s winter, and I don’t have money for a trip. This is roughly how a poor person dreams of becoming rich. If a person is not willing to act to get what he wants, he won’t get it. And he does not act because he is convinced that nothing will work out anyway. This is such a vicious circle. Desire has no power. It cannot even lift a finger. It is the intention, that is, the determination to act, that does it. Intention also includes a willingness to have. A person may say, “Well, you can’t take that away from me! It’s so easy, because I want to be rich!” No. Again, there is a deep gulf between “wanting” and “being willing to be.” For example, a poor person feels “out of place” in a rich setting or in an expensive store, even if he tries hard to convince himself and others otherwise. Deep down, he believes that he is not worthy of it all. Wealth is not part of the poor man’s comfort zone, not because being rich is uncomfortable, but because he is far from it all. The new chair is more comfortable, but the old chair is more comfortable. The poor are only familiar with the outward side of wealth: luxurious houses, expensive cars, jewelry, travel… If you put a poor person in such an environment, he will feel discomfort. And if you give him a suitcase of money, he will start to do all sorts of stupid things and lose everything in the end. The frequency of the energy he broadcasts is in sharp dissonance with such a life. And until the beggar lets the trappings of wealth into his comfort zone, until he learns to feel like a master of expensive things, he will remain poor, even if he finds the treasure.

One more obstacle on the way to wealth is envy. As we know, to envy means to be vexed by someone else’s good fortune. In this sense, there is nothing constructive about this feeling. But envy has a strong destructive element. Human psychology is organized in such a way: if he envies what he would like to have, he tries to depreciate it in every possible way. Here is the logic of “black envy: “I envy what he has. I do not have it, and I will hardly ever have it. But how am I worse than him? It means that the thing he possesses is bad, and I do not need it. This is how the desire to have turns into a psychological defense, and then develops into rejection. Rejection goes on a subtle level, because the subconscious mind takes everything literally. Consciousness depreciates the object of envy only for appearance, for self-assurance, whereas sub-consciousness takes everything seriously. And this is where it does a disservice, doing everything not to get what is devalued and rejected.

Thus you see what tenacious forces are holding a person to a poor life line. Events are even more dramatic when one moves from the affluent to the poor life line. There are times when a well-to-do person loses everything and ends up on the street. All the insidiousness of the transition to poverty is manifested in the fact that its spiral unfolds slowly, imperceptibly at first, and then more rapidly, so that it cannot be stopped. This spiral begins with temporary financial difficulties. Note that temporary financial difficulties can always happen to anyone. It is as common an inevitability as, say, rain on the day you are going on a picnic. If you don’t become enraged, depressed, anxious, or resentful of life about it without getting a boost, the situation will stabilize.

The real transition to the poor life line begins when you grasp the tip of the spiral and begin to unwind it. Your first reaction is dissatisfaction. This is still too little support for the difficult situation at hand, and if your emotions run out at this point, it will resolve. The other reaction is resentment, and this is already stronger, you begin to send information to your surroundings that someone is to blame for your financial difficulties. You respond to this second push with negative feedback or actions toward the perpetrators. At this point, the negative energy begins to fill you completely and a new spiral begins: you receive another paycheck even less, or prices jump, or you are required to pay a debt. Note, at this stage you are not yet aware of any process going on. It may just seem like an annoying nuisance. In reality, it is a directed process that you launched yourself, responding to the negativity with negativity. The frequency of your energy radiation is increasingly shifting from lines where you are successful to lines where you are deprived and resentful. So you transfer to the life lines corresponding to these new parameters. And so your situation becomes more and more aggravated. The bad news starts coming in from everywhere: prices are going up; things are not going well in your company. You begin to actively discuss this negative news with your acquaintances and relatives. The discussion, as a rule, is destructive, i.e. complaints, dissatisfaction and aggression against the alleged perpetrators. This is especially pronounced in companies where things are quite bad. There, the day begins with the postulate that “there is no money,” as with the morning prayer. In no case do not kill yourself over the lack or loss of money, otherwise there will be less and less. If a person earns little money, his typical mistake will be to whine about not having enough money forever. The parameters of such radiation correspond to poor life lines. It is especially dangerous to give in to anxiety that money is becoming less and less Fear is the most energetically saturated emotion, therefore by experiencing fear of losing or not making money you in the most effective way move yourself to the lines where money is really becoming less and less. At this stage you are already completely seized by the spiral, your radiation is tuned to a destructive frequency. As things are getting worse, you are gripped by anxiety. The energy of anxiety, in spite of its small value, is very well manifested in your actions. In this state, you will inevitably create an aura of negativity around you, increasingly experiencing discontent, aggression, depression, apathy, resentment, and so on. Thus the situation gets out of control and begins to develop in an avalanche-like manner. Fear takes hold of you completely, and you go on the rampage. It is as if you were taken by the arms and spun, spun, and then abruptly thrown. You flew aside, fell, and were left lying there in a state of shock. That’s a scary picture. And it all started with a little financial hardship. In the end, when the spiral unfolded, the unfortunate person lost a lot, at best, and at worst, everything. Further events could unfold in different ways: the unfortunate person would either remain lying on the unfortunate lifeline, or would begin to struggle to make it out. Such a transition can happen either to an individual or to a large group of people. In the second case, as you understand, it is not just a spiral, but a real whirlpool from which it is very difficult to get out.

The only remedy for this transition is not to grasp the tip of the spiral, not to succumb to emotion, and not to get involved in a destructive game. It is not enough to know how this mechanism works. It must always be kept in mind. Rebuff yourself whenever you habitually, as in a dream, accept this game, that is, express discontent, resentment, show concern, participate in destructive discussions, and so on. In dreams the same thing happens: until you realize that this is a dream, you are a puppet in someone else’s game and you may be haunted by nightmares. As soon as you wake up, shake off the vision, realize what the game is, that’s it, you are the master of the situation and will not become a victim of circumstances, while everyone around you is in a zombified state.

Let us summarize.

Each person chooses for himself or herself which life to be on, the line of poverty or the line of wealth. By emitting negative energy, a person’s own life line deteriorates. Aggression is mistaken for strength and dissatisfaction for a normal reaction. The more often a person responds to negative events, the worse for him/her, it leads him/her to the line of poverty.

Try to keep all negative information out of your life line. Not letting them in means not to avoid them, but intentionally to ignore them, not to be interested in them. Negative information, dissatisfaction and envy have not solved any problems yet, they add to them, so you need to concentrate on the good, and on the opportunities.

The world is like a mirror, reflecting your attitude toward it. When you are dissatisfied with the world, it turns away from you. When you fight the world, it fights you. When you stop your battle, the world comes to you.",https://medium.com/science-for-life/how-to-climb-out-of-poverty-c3137b8feaa2,[],2022-01-04 17:49:50.023000+00:00,"['Motivational', 'Motivation', 'Personal Development', 'Inspiration', 'Success']"
The first step along the way: Self-Accountability,"As humans, we tend to get caught up in the little things. Unbeknownst to us, those little things can turn into some big shit, real fast. So, trust that while you’re unique, you’re also not one in a million; along the way we all encounter negatives. May it be through childhood trauma, a loss of a loved one, toxic relationships, or any other traumatic experience. The effects can be long-lasting causing mental illnesses like anxiety, depression, and PTSD to brew up, making it a difficult journey to good mental health. Now, harboring those deep feelings and emotions aren’t “little things” by far, but in comparison to the bigger picture, it’s a speck in the universe of possibility. What if I told you that it’s not about what we encounter, but more to do with how we navigate through the experience?

Yes, that shitty experience may have torn you apart; left you alone in the woods where night was everlasting, and left you bleeding as bait for the wolves, but here you are. While you were torn apart, tools were left at your dispense to put yourself back together. It may have been everlasting darkness, but you were left with a light as bright as the sun; you. The snarls and growls of the wolves may have been terrifying, though you stood with immense courage and strength. We are equipped with the tools and the knowledge to overcome. It all boils down to whether we’re open and willing to use it. Why do we kick ourselves when we’re already down? Do we love being the victim? Do we love the attention that self-pity attracts? Stop acting like you’re not a god in training. There is always a choice and it’s yours to make. Create an exit plan out of the shit storm.

photography by Mary Alice Hammond

Amid cause and effect, we often confuse the hand that’s behind the negatives, as a force outside of ourselves and/or outside of our control. That is not true. Everything that we encounter along the way is a manifestation of what’s going on internally; how we view our image, our role in relationships, and our purpose. There comes a time when we have to stop placing blame on our negative experiences. We have to apologize to ourselves; the part we played in how we let our experience dictate our life. The decisions we made on our path and where it brought us are all on us.

You’ll forever be stuck in the tar pit of blame if you can’t realize who the main character in your story is. You are not the damsel in distress, you’re not the throw away extra, but you do have the choice of being the protagonist or the antagonist in your life. Choose wisely.

With regards to eating, that would imply that we would eat when we are genuinely eager, and eat just until fulfilled. Our chemicals are additionally going to be better adjusted on the grounds that our bodies got the time expected to rest, fix, and revive. Angela Lemond, RDN, an enrolled dietitian nutritionist in private practice in Texas

7. Dont Skip Meals

Keep in mind, our body’s definitive objective is to remain alive. When we are being kept from calories which are in a real sense the existence energy for our bodies it will get things done to get by. Our body knows what food varieties are higher in energy thickness, and we will long for those more. Honor your appetite and dont permit your body to believe it’s being famished. This conflicts with a large number of the abstaining from excessive food intake strategies, yet those strategies really don’t function admirably for individuals in the long haul. I by and large suggest eating like clockwork. Lemond

8. Remain Hydrated

Research has found that individuals who drank two glasses of water before a dinner lost more weight than individuals who didnt drink water before suppers and they kept it off. This straightforward tip works in two ways. Thirst can cover itself as yearning, making you eat more. Also, water causes you to feel more full, making you eat less during a feast. Megan Casper, RDN, a sustenance guide and the author and CEO of Nourished Bite

9. Cut Calories, Not Flavor

By picking choices like sharp cheddar over gentle cheddar, you can utilize less, yet youll still get a ton of flavor without feeling like you’re on a careful nutritional plan. Casper

10. Gauge Yourself Once every Week

Same day, same time, same measure of apparel. Recall that your weight isnt a solitary number yet a five-pound range. Work to drop the reach down, not the specific number. Lainey Younkin, RD, a nourishment guide and specialist in Boston

11. Revamp Your Plate

Make a large portion of your plate vegetables, a fourth of your plate entire grains, and a fourth of your plate lean protein. At the point when you switch the parts of grains and vegetables on your plate, you’ll see a distinction. The main admonition: Potatoes, corn, and peas are boring vegetables, so they go in the grains classification. Younkin

12. Keep the 80 Percent Guideline

Eat until you feel only 80% full. Pack any additional food away as opposed to feeling like you must be important for the perfect plate club. Helene Byrne, the originator of BeFit-Mom in Oakland, California

13. Skip the Liquid Calories

“There’s a strong relationship between sugar-sweetened beverages and weight gain in adults. If you regularly have a sip of something sweet, consider this: Research has shown that reducing intake of sugar-sweetened beverages can result in meaningful weight loss, even if it’s the only change you make. Replacing a 20-ounce soda with sparkling water every day would save more than 20,000 calories over a few months, which could translate into more than five pounds of weight loss!” — Brittany Markides, RDN, the founder of Choose Food in Austin, Texas

14. Be Choosy at Restaurants

“The foods we eat away from home tend to be higher in calories and lower in nutrients than the ones we make at home. A study published in April 2016 in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticsfound that the average restaurant entrée contains more than 1,000 calories, and an entire day’s worth of sodium and fat. To save calories, split your entrée or ask the server to substitute extra green veggies or a salad for potato or rice.” — Markides

15. Embrace Veggies

“When in doubt, eat a vegetable. They’re low-calorie, high-fiber, and full of nutrition. Snack on kale, lettuce, carrots, or green beans. And finally: Skip the butter and oil, but do add herbs or garlic for a great taste.” — Jamie Logie, a personal trainer, nutritionist, health coach, and wellness blogger in London, Ontario

16. In Fact, Make Vegetables the Stars

“Next time you make pasta, make a very small portion of the pasta itself and toss the dish with roasted broccoli, shrimp, garlic, and lemon zest. You’ll feel less deprived and you’ll be able to still eat your favorite satisfying foods.” — Kate Martino, a physician’s assistant and weight loss coach in private practice in Fair Lawn, New Jersey

17. Keep Unhealthy Foods out of the House

“It’s pretty simple: If you don’t have it, you can’t eat it. Instead of chips and cookies, keep convenient and easy-to-prepare items at close reach. Such items include nuts and seeds, precut fruit and vegetables, string cheese, edamame, eggs, salmon, and yogurt. This doesn’t mean you can’t have treats. Just buy yourself one serving to enjoy at a time.” — Rachel Goodman, RDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist in private practice in Brooklyn, New York

18. Use Portion-Controlled Dishes

“We eat with our eyes first and we like to see a full plate. Using smaller plates, bowls, and cups will reduce the amount of food you can serve yourself, while at the same time allow you to fill your dish up and keep you from feeling deprived. For example, an observational study showed that people who used a 9-inch plate versus a 10- or 12-inch plate ate up to 22 percent less!” — Goodman

19. Start Where You Are and Do What You Can

“Don’t feel like you need to overhaul your entire life starting immediately. Assess where you are currently and then figure out where you’d like to be in the future. A great starting point for mostly sedentary people is to get a step counter and see how much you walk on a normal day. Then set a step goal slightly higher than the norm and strive for that, working your way up slowly to a goal of 10,000 steps per day.” — Esther Avant, an ACE-certified personal trainer in Kapolei, Hawaii

20. Salt Craving? Skip the Chips

“When you need a salty fix, reach for popcorn, not chips. According to one study, those who munch on a cup of the air-popped treat are significantly more satisfied than their chip-loving friends. Popcorn is a whole grain, fiber-filled snack. A single serving of potato chips (for a typical 1-oz small bag) is a dense 149 calories, while the same amount of popcorn (air-popped) is only 108, meaning you can feel full and slim down with every delicious bite.” — Rene Ficek, RD, CDE, with Seattle Sutton’s Healthy Eating

21. Eat Breakfast

“To combat the urge to overindulge in the evening, make sure to eat a protein- and fiber-filled breakfast in the morning. Healthy choices for protein include eggs, yogurt, and nuts or nut butters. Pair protein with a high-fiber food like a high-fiber cereal or fruit.” — Ficek

How to lose weight for sure!,"DIET

Have a high protein breakfast, milk and eggs are recommended.Healthy protein sources include:

meat: beef, chicken, pork, and lamb

beef, chicken, pork, and lamb fish and seafood: salmon, trout, and shrimp

salmon, trout, and shrimp eggs: whole eggs with the yolk

whole eggs with the yolk plant-based proteins: beans, legumes, quinoa, tempeh, and tofu

2. Cut back on refined carbs, DO NOT eat sweets and sugary food they are bad for you, stay away from all types of soft drinks. This helps you lower your appetite.

3. Eat a lot of VEGETABLES, when ever you feel hungry or are craving for that fried snack go and grab a vegetable this will give you all the vitamins and fiber necessary for your metabolism. Vegetables to include for low carb or low calorie eating plans:

broccoli

cauliflower

spinach

tomatoes

kale

Brussels sprouts

cabbage

Swiss chard

lettuce

cucumber

4. Drink water before meals.

5. Eat healthy fats, don’t be afraid, your body still needs healthy fats, avocado oil and olive oil are great choices.

SUMMARY

Assemble each meal out of a protein source, healthy fat source, complex carb, and vegetables.

Leafy green vegetables are a great way to bulk up a meal with low calories and lots of nutrients.

WORKOUTS

Although working out isn’t necessary, it does fasten the process.

Lifting weights is a great start, it burns a lot of calories and keeps your metabolism from slowing down. 2 to 3 times a week to the gym is a great start and then you can move from there, if you’re new to the gym get yourself a trainer as that would be the best.

If gym and weight lifting is not an option for you then cardiovascular exercises like walking, jogging, running, swimming, cycling are really good for your health, not only does it help you shed some calories but it also improves the health of your heart and increases blood flow throughout the body. So regular cardio is very much recommended.

SUPPLEMENTS

There are great weight loss supplements out there, but you need to be very careful because many of them out there cause bad side effects and aren’t healthy. Here are some of the best working supplements for weight loss.

EXIPURE

So what is exipure?

Exipure is an all-natural supplement that helps you lose weight, reduce your cholesterol and blood pressure levels. The product contains a combination of natural ingredients, including green tea extract, guarana seed powder, chromium picolinate, L-carnitine fumarate, vitamin B6, magnesium oxide, Ginkgo Biloba leaf extract, yerba mate herb, alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, and more.

The aim of this pill is to increase metabolism to burn fat faster. Exipure works by boosting your brown adipose tissue (BAT) levels to burn fat and increase metabolism. It is a natural supplement that helps you lose weight without any side effects or negative impacts on the body. The product contains no harmful chemicals, preservatives, or additives, and is FDA approved which make it safe for consumption.

But does it work for real?

Several types of research go a long way to back the effectiveness of Exipure. There is no argument, the blend of nutrients in this product works, and it has been proven by many studies that have gone on for years now.

For example, an Exipure study in 2017 on rats showed that there was an increase in fat burning after just two weeks of using the supplement. The same rat study also showed that the extract had anti-inflammatory properties, which helped reduce inflammation within the body.

REVIEWS FROM USERS

""I started taking ExiPure 2 months ago, and I am amazed at my progress so far. My husband lost 50 lbs over 6 months, and he feels amazing. He looks 10 years younger, and his skin glows. We both love our new bodies. it’s a great product i recommend you to buy now!""

“This stuff changed my life. I’ve never felt healthier and happier. I’m down 20lbs since starting the program. I don’t think anything else compares to Exipure.”

DOSAGE

Start with one capsule once daily and gradually build up to two capsules twice daily over 7–14 days. For best results, continue to take two capsules twice daily for 6–12 months.

REVITAA PRO

What is revitaa pro?

Revitaa pro is a all natural nutritional supplement that helps reduce stress and lose weight! It is FDA approved, gluten free, non GMO and safe.

The formula comprises TBT(Tributyltin) and Resveratrol-rich Japanese Knotweed to help you reduce weight, stress, stay healthy and live longer.

Unlike other weight loss products on the market, this one has undergone significant investigations before being released.

But does it work for real?

DOSAGE

When consumed in the proper dosage, which is one capsule twice a day with meals, this single ingredient has been shown in studies to reduce cholesterol levels, regulate blood sugar and pressure, reduce cortisol levels, and speed fat-burning.

CONCLUSION

Having a low carb, high protein diet, exercising daily and using any one of these supplements will help you reduce weight pretty quickly, but all of these must be done consistently.

WARNING: You are NOT going to find anything B-O-R-I-N-G! like doing 2000 minutes of cardio (blah) or eating more fruits and veggies (yawn!) here.

I don’t have plans to bore you (not today!). I’m only giving your practical tips you can start to use instantly to burn un-wanted body fat.

And I’m going to keep this report stupid simple, short, and sweet (If I’m talking too much please stop me :-)

Okay, without any further delay here are the 5 ways to cheat your way to fat-loss…

#1. Make This Simple Oil Change And You Can Burn up to 18 kg of Excess Fat Per Year.

Now, all oils used in cooking, frying and baking contains the same amount of calories.

BUT NOT COCONUT OIL

You see, because of the small size of the fatty acids that make up coconut oil, they actually yield fewer calories than other fats and oil (at least 2.25% fewer calories per gram of fat).

To prove this, researchers at McGill University in Canada conducted some experiments and found that…… If you replace all the oils in your diet (such as soybean oil, canola oil, safflower oil, and the likes) with coconut oil, you can lose up to 18 kg of excess fat per year.

And this is without changing your diet or reducing the number of calories you eat. All you simply have to do is get an oil change full-stop. Now, this small reduction in calories is only part of the picture, Coconut oil also helps you lose weight through other complicated processes (like thermogenesis) that I don’t want to bore you with.

All you should know is this:

If you want to lose unwanted body fat, the best and simple thing you can do is to start using coconut oil in place of other oils you already use (in cooking, baking and frying) now.

If you want to know more about coconut oil and it’s buying rules, so you don’t make the mistake of buying the wrong stuff go HERE

Okay it’s time for trick 2…

#2. Use This Quick Plate Hack That Tricks Your Brain Into Eating Less

Your mind will always play tricks on you when it comes to the relative size perception of your portion and your plate all thanks to the Delboeuf Illusion

Which plate has more food, A or B?…

…If you said A, then you’re wrong.

But if you said B, then……. you’re also wrong.

The right answer is this:

The two plates have exactly the same amount of food. However, plate B looks fuller because of a “visual perception bias” called “Delboeuf illusion”

Some crazy researchers decided to put the power of “Delboeuf illusion” to the test by secretly observing all the attendees of a party…

…And the overall conclusion was that people over served themselves when using larger plates and under served themselves when using smaller ones.

Imagine what a difference like that can make on your waistlines!

So how do we use this to your advantage?

If you’re thinking of breaking all the big plates in your house, well, that’s a hardcore option.

However, I’ll suggest switching to smaller plates to trick your brain to think it’s eating more food (and leaving the big plates for your hungry neighbors and friends. Doing this will help you consume fewer calories, therefore you’ll lose weight without even trying.

If that doesn’t work well, then you’ll definitely want to look at the next trick…

#3. Deploy this ancient Asian trick for weight control

Photo by Nataliya Vaitkevich from Pexels

You see, when you’re eating and you becomes full, your stomach sends a message to your brain. This message alerts your brain that you’re full and eating should stop.

Now, the problem is this:

It takes your brain several minute to receive, recognize and act on the “Stop eating” message (from your stomach).

So by the time your brain acts on it (the message), you would have consumed excess calories the body doesn’t need or want.

Now, is there a way to speed up the signal from your stomach to your brain that allows you to stop eating sooner?… Glad you asked.

Fortunately, there’s a quick fix for that. It is:

Drink a full glass of water 10 to 15 minutes before eating your meals.

How does that help? The answer is simple.

You see, when you drink water before your meal, it fills your stomach up and kick starts the process that sends the “stop eating” signal to the brain. So when you start eating, you feel full sooner, therefore you don’t overeat.

That’s why in many Asian countries, liquids are consumed before meals to fill the stomach in order to reduce hunger and prevent overeating. And also to stimulate digestive juices to improve digestion.

If you find the taste of ordinary water boring then try adding fresh lemon or cucumber (or any other fruit) to your water to make it more delicious and fun.

A bonus trick is to add a lot of fresh pepper while cooking your foods. This does two things;

1. Makes the food peppery, so you drink more water while eating, therefore you’re likely to eat less.

2. It boosts your metabolism because pepper is a good metabolism booster.

Once you’ve added water and more pepper to your food, move onto cheat #4

#4. A Simple Overlooked Weapon to Win The Weight

Of all the weight loss tricks I have for you today, this one is the easiest to implement… and also… easiest to forget.

It is one of the most important and most overlooked weight loss weapons in your arsenal.

What’s this secret weapon I’m talking about?

SLEEP

Now, you might be thinking how can sleep help me lose weight eh?

Just to mention a few….

❖ Enough Sleep can prevent hunger and cravings of junk food.

❖ Sleep prevents disruption of your hunger and fullness hormones ( ghrelin and leptin)- thereby avoiding “by-chemical” tendency for weight gain

❖ Sleeping early cuts down snacking time during the day

Think about this for a second

If you sleep After eating dinner, then that prevents you from trekking back and forth to the fridge Looking for what to eat again after dinner.

Well, as a matter of fact, If you sleep early, you’ll be able to wake up early enough to prepare a nutritious and healthy breakfast.

If you have trouble sleeping then use this simple formula (it works all the time)

What formula?

It called the “10–3–2–1–0” sleeping formula:

10 hours before bed: No more caffeine

3 hours before bed: No more food or alcohol

2 hours before bed: No more work

1 hour before bed: No more screen time

0: The number of times you hit the snooze button in the morning

Once you’re done sleeping, then you’re ready for the next trick.

#5.Hack NEPA to Lose Weight Effortlessly

What’s one major difference between slim people and fat people?

Faster metabolism?… Nope (most times)

Good genes?…. Nope (most times)

Answer is slim peeps engage in more NEPA activities

Wait! NEPA what?!

NEPA stands for Non-Exercise Physical Activity — This is the energy we expend each day for everything that is NOT sleeping, eating, or sports-like activities/exercise.

It’s also called NEAT( Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis).

Here is a “jaw-dropping” fact about NEPA/NEAT — It can help you burn 10 times more calories (about 1,500 to 2,400 calories ) than a regular exercise in a day.

You see where I’m going with this, don’t you?

Long story short, What I’ve been trying to say since morning is just “move more” .Look for every excuse to move more.

For example:

● Use the stairs instead of the escalator or elevator

● Walk around your house while having phone calls

● Intentionally park you car a bit far so you can walk

● Get the remote and Wash your plates yourself (I bet your kids and waistline would love that)

● Take quick 10 minute walks every 2 hours to boost your metabolism and refresh your mind.

● Have More Sex (married of course). Ladies especially, don’t just lay down like a log of wood, join the party, you can get in more NEPA/NEAT while having more fun.

Honestly, I couldn’t even finish this report without walking up and down my house — I feel more pumped!

Anyhow:

Use as many of these tactics to up your NEPA time daily and cure the “ sitting disease ” forever!

Use This Food Re-arrangement Technique To Keep you Full For Days

One of the best ways to be some “kg lighter” without counting calories or portion control is cutting down on carbs and replacing them with protein.

Hollop! Hollop! If you’re starting to think I’m talking about low carb diet — I’m NOT

I’m saying cutting down carbs to increase your protein intake not because carbs are particularly fattening BUT because the types of carbs we mostly eat (like bread, rice and so on) Can’t keep us full for long — And that’s where protein come to the rescue, to keep you full longer.

Which ultimately helps you eat fewer calories at the end of the day. So what Am I asking you to do is a simple “food quantity” re-arrangement

What does that even mean? Simple

Instead of the normal plenty carbs, tiny protein you normally eat, you should re-arrange it to plenty protein and little carbs.

To make it crystal clear as day, here are few example:

➢ Instead of a big hip of rice and one small meat, you should have a big meat/chicken and a small rice

➢ Instead of 10 slices of bread and two eggs you normally eat, you should have 3 slices of bread and 4 eggs… or better still… 3 slices of bread 2 eggs mixed with sardines

That’s all folks.

Remember that it’s the little things that make the biggest difference. And nobody can find time to make this changes, we have to make time.

Polkadot vs. Cosmos vs. Ethereum 2.0 — for real idiots,"Main Part — Understanding the basics

We managed our way through this first passage and now come to the part how these things are generally addressed. But what does generally mean? The thing is, that no project just does everything on its own. All of them stand on the shoulders of giants and are influenced by each other. Ethereum was such a big success, that there is no project that does not look at it.

1. Scalability

There are 2 types of scaling. Vertical and horizontal scaling. This does not apply to blockchain only, it also applies to software development in general and it also applies to everything. May it be businesses or whatever processes you imagine. Let’s take out our excavators again. If we scale horizontally, then we put more and more excavators on the field. If we scale vertically, we buy faster, bigger, better excavators. Their arms move faster and have bigger shovels, nice. For such excavators it’s quite obvious that horizontal scaling implies more friction, they are more likely to interfere with each other so that the scaling is no longer linear. Vertical scaling does not have this problem in the same way, since it is just the same unit being upgraded, so no additional communication costs and no space limitation (as long as the excavator fits on the construction site :D). The problem with vertical scaling lies in the circumstance that there are technological limits. At some point it becomes complicated to find a bigger hydraulic system, that is still able to move the shovel. Once you have put the biggest hydraulic system from the market into your excavator, you cannot further scale it vertically. You can buy more hydraulic systems and operate these in parallel, this is horizontal scaling and the excavator might still be a single unit and being scaled vertically, but the hydraulic system will be subject of diminishing returns, or say sub-linear scaling (typical for horizontal scaling). So internally the excavator is scaled up horizontally. The same applies for every component and the more you add to the excavator the more expensive it becomes and more heavy-weight and so on.

My feeling when researching for this piece of text here.

Software has a special property, which basically means that copying it is very cheap. So one would say, that horizontal scaling comes for free? Well, there is still communication necessary. You can fork Bitcoin 100 times and then process 100 times the transcations, but it is no longer the same network. You might have a BTC on network #15 and someone else has a wallet on network #45, how do you interact with each other? You cannot. This is the big problem of horizontal scaling. In contrast for vertical scaling, we have the technological limits. Proof-of-Work and Longest-Chain-Rule can be scaled up by increasing block size and reducing block time. Seems to be very easy, but it is actually not an option. A fair competition and a real randomness of blocks being found is only guaranteed, if there is enough time to run the hunt for the next hash. The more you reduce the block time the more the network centralizes to those actors, which can communicate fastest to the others, the same applies with block size and bandwidth. Sad.

But what is the general approach to this? Do the cool blockchain kids of today try to scale vertically or horizontally? Turns out, both. The default solution for vertical scaling is Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The default solution for horizontal scaling is having multiple blockchains interoperating with each other. I will not explain all the fine details of PoS here, since I have done that in another article that is linked further above. We also don’t need to understand this stuff here, what we need to know is: PoS does not run a probabilistic puzzle, therefore the next block can be produced much faster. There is no need to have a long block time, the limit is basically how fast the members of the network can process a block and how fast they can communicate. Process time of a block is just a matter of CPUs or GPUs, something that can be scaled quite easily. Network delay is something that is ultimately limited by the speed of light, so a photon needs roughly 133 ms to travel around the earth. Signals in copper are 3 times slower, photons in fiber optics only lose 33% of their speed, so 200 ms is possible. However there are also routers in between and fibres might not be perfectly laid out and we need to have packets go back and forth, so let’s say 1s is reasonable.

It might be really hard to have a distributed application where all of it’s participants are informed of an update and agree to it in less than 1 second. It also depends on bandwidth compared to the block size, but for example Bitcoin blocks are 1 MB and this is not a bandwidth issue here. So if we assume Bitcoin block size and calculate the increase of throughput by running something that really has this 1s time, then we arrive at 600 times speed up. I will try to lay out how this is calculated and hopefully make it easy enough to understand. Bitcoin block time is 10 minutes and a minute has 60 seconds, so if we multiply that, we end up with 600 times the number of blocks in the same timespan. Nice speedup. Another complex calculation of Bitcoin’s 7 tx/s multiplied with 600 gives us 4200 tx/s, so in essence, Visa level is achievable by having a 1MB block every second. In reality though the timing is more between 4s and 7s, but we can also increase the block size as well, so vertical scaling looks good. Proof-of-Stake has another nice advantage, which is that it doesn’t increase global warming more than necessary. So we can get rich with it, but without destroying our planet. A nice addition on the list.

But here is one problem to mention and this has to do with this communication thing. In Nakamoto Consensus a new block can be broadcasted and you don’t need to wait for anything. The nodes communicate with a gossip network, so everyone tells its neighbors their new data (blocks). Why is there no need to wait for anyone? Because anybody can verify blocks without asking anyone. This is a very great feature and with PoS this is not possible. There is no cryptographic puzzle, so you cannot just verify a hash. You need to know if all the others have agreed. This means if there are 100 block producers, each of them needs to communicate with 99 others. If there are 10.000 block producers, each of them needs to coordinate with 9999. This basically means for N participants each one needs to communicate with N-1. So the communication scaling is N*(N-1), for large N the 1 does not matter, so we end up with N². We call this the N²-Problem and it means we can’t scale the block producers, or better say validators, indefinitely with PoS.

So is there a solution for the N²-Problem? Sure. A very common one is the validator delegator split. The blocks are produced by validators, who run nodes and propose blocks one after each other and vote if these blocks are valid. Their voting power is determined by their own stake plus the delegated stake from the delegators. The delegators do not run a server, they just bond their stake to a validator, who runs a server. The N²-Problem is solved, because there is only network communication necessary between the validators, so the number can be small, for example 100. What is the reason why we want to have as many nodes as possible? There are 2, one is prevention of cartel formation/collusion and the other is partition tolerance. So are we performing worse now? Well, the cartel formation or collusion part is actually still prevented by delegators. Since these can scale indefinitely, to form a cartel one needs to bribe the delegators stake as well. In case some cartel is forming, then the delegators should withdraw their stake from this cartel and redistribute it to other validators. For the partition tolerance the delegators do not help and partition tolerance is also lowered by another property of most PoS implementations. Based on practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance the liveness of such networks is different to Nakamoto Consensus. When too many nodes go down, then the network halts and cannot produce a new block. In contrast Nakamoto consensus does not really care. When half of the miners go down, then the next block will take longer — 20 minutes if half of the mining power is affected — but this will relax back to the targeted 10 minutes, if the network remains split. So here is a key take home message: PoS lowers partition tolerance.

It is sad to have less partition tolerance, but on the one hand events where half of the block producers go offline, are so severe that it might be good to stop and wait for a moment anyway and on the other hand we get a nice feature for this tradeoff and that is finality. It means that blocks become final at some point. So in Nakamoto Consensus it is in theory possible that any block might be reverted later by a concurrent fork of the blockchain. That is not the case if some variant of pBFT is implemented.

Nice, so we are happy? Well, PoS has some other problems, too. Namely Long-Range-Attack and Nothing-at-Stake, which do not exist in PoW or not to that extent. These problems need to be solved in order to deploy a functional cryptocurrency. Let’s have a short look into these problems. If we implement PoS naively, which means like Nakamoto Consensus, but swapping PoW with PoS, then it is possible for an attacker to create an alternative reality. At some point in the past, an attacker could fork off and create their own reality. For example when the attacker has 1% of the stake, every 100th block is produced by the attacker. In this block the attacker maliciously increases their stake until after this has happened often enough the attacker has enough stake to take over the network. Once taken over, the attacker can produce many blocks very fast. Of course the attacker cannot fool other validators, who don’t agree to this reality. But imagine someone joining the network and wanting to download the blockchain history. This newcomer cannot decide if the reality presented by our attacker is real or not. Even more so, if he also downloads a competing reality from another validator, then using the Longest-Chain-Rule would lead to the faked chain to be more trustworthy. Since this attack works better the earlier it fakes blocks, it can basically start from the genesis block forging a different reality. That is why this is called Long-Range-Attack. Why doesn’t this work in PoW? Because you need to have the mining power to forge many blocks with high difficulty. You cannot just make up a blockchain in PoW with very high difficulty and being very long without having a lot of mining power. So any outsider can easily see your alternative fork is not the longest (heaviest) chain. Contrarily to what I just said the name Long-Range-Attack originally comes from PoW but what it means for PoW is a bit different (if you want to know, you can read it on the ethereum blog).

Ok, so how can we solve this? Well, actually we can’t use Longest-Chain-Rule anyway, so we need to change some parts anyway. The solution can be checkpointing. This basically means we decide that there is no way to revert some blocks. There cannot be an alternate fork overtaking these blocks anymore. This block is final. We have heard of this feature already and it is called finality. We also see that for Bitcoin it is hard to have such a checkpoint, since there is no one to decide when to do it. So what does it imply? Well, at these final blocks there is a fixed state, which we can write down and now it is sufficient for any outsider to just download this fixed state. This also means an outsider does not need to download the whole blockchain history anymore. Since all effects of the history are condensed in the state at this point. This is also called pruning. For example in Ethereum, without pruning the blockchain would be 4 TB big and with it, it stays quite small, only a few hundred GB. This still sounds like very much, but it is a big difference when it comes to what a server can easily handle.

However we see another point here, why it is hard for Bitcoin to do that. There is no state in Bitcoin. In Bitcoin blocks do collect a number of transactions which result in UTXOs on Bitcoin addresses. To know the balance of an address one needs to sum up all blocks. Ok, so how do these PoS/BFT consensus systems allow checkpoints? Basically they are defined in the protocol. So it would have been possible for Bitcoin to define such checkpoints as well, but it would mean a lot of implications, that Satoshi Nakamoto most likely wanted to avoid. In PoS/BFT this comes for free, since these implications are already bought. The most important one is waiting for all participants until they responded or at least the majority has responded. You cannot just go and say every 500th Block is final or so in Bitcoin, because that would give the lucky one to find such a block too much power. At such a point you need to make sure that everyone agrees to this checkpoint, since the good reasons to allow for competing forks still hold. In PoS/BFT we don’t need to insert such a thing into the consensus mechanism, since every block is produced by a vote. When 2/3 vote a block valid it becomes a block. In pBFT it even becomes a final block. So using this approach to make PoS a reality, the solution to the Long-Range-Attack comes for free. Nice.

Those of of you who can’t relate, please think twice.

Leaves us with the Nothing-At-Stake problem and it describes that there is nothing at stake when it comes to fork choice. In PoW if there are concurrent forks, you have to decide which to follow, since you cannot mine all of them. If between these forks there is just 1 transaction different, the hash will be different and you can only mine on one fork. This makes fork choice necessary. In PoS your coins get duplicated for each fork, so you can “mine” or better say validate on every single fork. This is even something that is not just possible but incentivized. It makes sense for you to follow any fork and receive the block rewards. Not a very good prospect if there might be 100 forks soon and nobody wants to solve that forkin’ mess. Even though such an attack never happened it might be the fear of it happening being one of the main reasons why early PoS Coins failed. There are some other factors, maybe the high pre-mine that was hated back in these days not giving “proper decentralization” or the lack of seeing and implementing the advantages of PoS. Discussing that is an interesting alternative topic, but let’s come back to what we are looking at here. We have an attack vector and it should be solved. How do we disincentivize validators from following each possible fork? Well, by punishing them for doing so. So in order to get the desired behavior, the protocol defines a punishment. So forks can still be done, but you have to decide. All members of your fork, slash the coins (punishment) of the members of the other fork and vice versa. If someone follows both, then slashing will happen on both. Other misbehavior is also punished by slashing coins and that is double spending and being offline for too long. With this combination of BFT + PoS + Slashing we have a system that makes misbehavior costly. The very same applies for PoW + Longest-Chain-Rule (Nakamoto Consensus). If you follow the wrong fork there, you lose your invested work, which means paid electricity, which means money. In case you misbehave and attack the blockchain properly you might also destroy the value of the coin you are invested in.

In PoS this is even tighter connected, since you must own the coin and not the hardware which might lose a lot of value, when the coin becomes worthless (for ASICs more than for GPUs). Ok great, so is both the same? Not the same, both approaches achieve the same goal, but there is a very important difference. In PoS you need to lock up coins and get punished in case shit happens, in PoW you need to burn electricity and only get something for it, if you don’t misbehave. Both achieves security for the decentral network, but one does not destroy the planet by wasting a lot of energy, which is an advantage. Just imagine how nice that would be.

With PoS this can become a reality without the part, where the planet is destroyed.

Now that we understand why PoS makes a hell lot of sense, we also want to understand why it is much faster. In Nakamoto Consensus the actual processing of transactions is not very costly. The costly part is solving the cryptographic puzzle. To make it fair the time to solve the puzzle must be many orders longer than the propagation time of a block. If there is not enough time, then either the finder of the last block is highly advantaged (extreme case) or the most central nodes in the network have an advantage (more realistic case).

Well, this is not 100% true, since for example in Ethereum there are Uncles. Uncles are blocks that were found and are valid, but do not belong to the main line of the blockchain. So just like that strange uncle on a family gathering these are not really wanted in the first place, but belong to the family anyway. For Ethereum this means the Uncle gets included, if it is valid and for the finder of a block this means you can get it into the blockchain even if someone else was just 1 second faster than you. This allows for a drastic reduction in block time (15s for Ethereum). But still Ethereum is not significantly faster than Bitcoin. So let’s go back to PoS. There we don’t need to run such a long timing for the puzzle, since there is no puzzle, we only need the time to let everyone get to know from everyone else that the block is valid. Then we can go on producing the next block. There are different ways of selecting the next block producer, but it does not really make a difference. The important part is that on a planet like the earth and with the speed of light the whole process can be done in a second or two. The size of the block is mostly limited by bandwidth, so this might increase in the future. For Bitcoin this also holds true, but there are more adverse forces being against bigger blocks and the reason is mostly to keep decentralization at maximum.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the main approach to vertical scaling, PoS, let’s now look at horizontal scaling. There are 2 candidates and they are quite similar. The one is interoperability and the other one is sharding. Interoperability also belongs into the compatibility category, since it connects different blockchains together. So if Interoperability is solved we can make incompatible things compatible. But if we can do that, we can also create 100 forks of a given blockchain and let each fork talk to each other and connect the stuff. 100 forks process 100 times the number of blocks of a single fork, so why this scales is obvious. The big problem here is: How to have trustless Transactions between two blockchains? This is a good question and I will try to answer it, by giving a simple example how one can connect 2 blockchains without inventing any new technology. By the way, I find it very strange that in this blockchain world you find 1000 articles explaining how awesome and important interoperability is, but almost never it is expained how it actually works. Even if someone goes on a specific reddit and asks, please explain it to me, then users keep responding this “Yeah the IBC protocol makes it possible to have 2 blockchains securely talk to each other”, ok fine, but how?

Somehow all different interoperability memes are about how people talk too much about it, without understanding it.

Let’s assume we have Bob and Alice, where Bob has a Bitcoin and wants to trade his Bitcoin with Alice, who has an Ether. Both understand that exchanges like Mt.Gox do exist or say do exist only a limited amount of time and might go pop tomorrow and don’t want to put their valuable coins on an untrustworthy exchange. Not saying the exchange is a scam, but what can it do? In the end it is a central entity, that can always fall to individuals mistakes, bad architecture or just someone randomly dying in an airplane, being the only one with the private keys of the exchange’s wallet. So both of them really want to do their trade in a secure decentral manner. Now they have heard about such a great concept that is DEX (decentral exchange). But unfortunately this only works if they exchange shitcoin A with shitcoin B and both are from smart contracts of the same (Ethereum) blockchain. In the case of 2 different blockchains, this is not possible.

So they have another idea. There are a lot of friends of the two, that are willing to help them, some of them know each other, but most of them don’t. So let’s take 5 of them, that don’t know each other. Now they create a multi-sig wallet on Bitcoin and do the same on Ethereum. What is a multi-sig wallet? This is a wallet, where all of the 5 have to sign a transaction to send it into the blockchain. You can also have a multi-sig wallet, where only 3 of 5 need to sign, but for this example it does not really matter. So these 5 create two multi-sig wallets. Now Bob sends his bitcoin to the multi-sig wallet on the Bitcoin blockchain and Alice sends her Ether to the multi-sig wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. If both do it, we go to the next step, if not, then the 5 create a transaction that sends the Bitcoin back to Bob or the Ether back to Alice. Note that no one can single handedly run away with either the Bitcoin or the Ether here.

Now that both have transacted their coins, one member of the 5 creates a transaction, which sends the Bitcoin from the multi-sig wallet to Alice’s bitcoin address and another transaction that sends the Ether to Bob’s Ethereum adress. Now the other 4 members of the 5 see that both transactions were created just as planned and sign both of them. After that both coins are sent to the other one and they have successfuly made a decentral trade. Again nobody could have walked away with the coins single-handedly. This would only have been possible if all of the 5 colluded. Still there might be reasons for them to do so, for example a large transaction, where stealing the coins and dividing by 5 is more valuable than the reputation they lose in this process. That is why we maybe want 100 instead of 5. So basically we have solved interoperability now? Well, it might be a bit troublesome to find 5 or even 100 multi-sig wallet holders for every trade two blockchain users want to make. One approach could be to just set up a team of 100, that keeps doing this thing for everyone. Unfortunately this increases the security demands on these even more.

Is there some way to ensure that they act properly? Well, punishment is the key again. How about letting these 5 or 100 lock up some coins and if they misbehave, these coins get slashed. This makes it much more dangerous to try and start a collusion with others, since these might report such a behavior. However it might be hard to find 100, where each of them is willing to lock up a big amount of coins. But wait, really? We actually have some candidates that already did so and these are the validators of our PoS blockchain. It becomes interesting here. These validators are even running a server anyway and even more so handle transactions. So great, we just use the validators and problem solved? Unfortunately problems arise again. One problem might be forks. Again. So even if these 5 or 100 see that both have sent their coins, then it might still happen, that in 20 minutes there is another fork of the blockchain taking over and in that Alice maybe did not provide their part of the deal. But if the other part of the deal was already sent, then there is no way to stop it. So actually one needs to wait until there will be no more forks possible. In theory this is not possible for blockchains like Bitcoin. What we need here is finality. Aha. So PoS also provides a nice feature for interoperability as well.+

The faster finality is the faster a cross blockchain transaction can be finally settled. But does that mean, it is not possible at all to include Bitcoin into our whole interoperable world? Well, actually it is possible to create something that is called a Peg-Zone or Bridge, which takes Bitcoin and creates pegged or wrapped Bitcoin for that. The pegged Bitcoin is now rooted on a PoS blockchain and has finality and the real Bitcoin is waiting in a wallet controlled by the Peg-Zone. When someone wants to have the real thing back, the minted/pegged Bitcoin is burned again and the real Bitcoin is sent to a Bitcoin address. In this case the Peg-Zone can never be 100% sure, that there will not be a competing fork taking over, but this is basically the same problem exchanges have today, when they accept coins of blockchains without finality. So this means in a very strict theoretical thinking, the state of the chain is never final, but after many blocks, for example 10, it becomes extremely costly to try an attack that is successful. It depends on many parameters, but the basic thing here is, that you need to be faster than the miners of the blockchain to forge an alternate reality. So you need to invest into more miners that already exist and then attacking might crash the price of that coin, rendering your attack unlucrative. If you have less miners, for example only 10% of the total mining power, then you can still try your statistical luck, since you can still be succesful in finding a competing block, where you steal the coins from the Peg-Zone, but doing this for 2 blocks becomes less likely. For example if you have a 10% chance to find the next block, then you only have a 1% chance to find the block after that as well and if you need to find 10 blocks to do the attack, you have a 0,00000001% of succeeding. In order to try that you still need to run these miners, which might cost some billions of dollars. It is unlikely that you can easily steal that much money, so in essence and for practical reasons, it is not possible to attack this Peg-Zone without losing money.

Those of you who can’t rela… wait we had this caption already.

Unfortunately this implies we have to wait for several blocks. In contrast to both sides having PoS with instant finality, we can do the thing with 1 block. Ok nice, is there something else? Yes. If we have these PoS chains set up, then it might be even possible to have shared security, which means we have shared validators on both blockchains. These are very interesting for our example, because they can be punished on both sides if they misbehave. Making bribing more complicated thus increasing security. Ok nice, so this is everything I need to know? No. There is even more. Basically we don’t need to send coins. We can also just send transactions with information across different blockchains. This means smart contracts can talk to each other. This is also a nice feature. Ok, but now we have everything? Well, let’s say we understand the basics and there are many details, for example why it makes sense to have a light client of each blockchain, allowing the members of the other blockchain to easily verify things. But let’s leave it at that for now.

And let’s go to sharding, which is a bit more accessible now that we have read so much and understand a lot more about how all of this stuff interacts. Sharding scales for the same reason interoperability scales, but instead of having multiple independent blockchains in parallel and make them communicate, we want to find a way to split up a single blockchain into multiple parts, or say shards. Sounds like it would end up with the same result, but it doesn’t. The source of the differences is that the first approach copies the blockchain and gives each copy its own infrastructure and the second approach has the same infrastructure trying to split up its workers over many parts. This is why for interoperable blockchains the big question is how to make these disjoint parts interact safely with each other and for shards the question is how to organize all these workers so that single entities cannot corrupt the whole thing.

After we see this approach as something where the workers of the infrastructure are divided and no worker does all of the work, we get an idea why sharding is good for scaling. The work is producing blocks and the workers are the validators. Sharding allows to split up this work, so that only a small fraction of the validators work on the same part of the network. The reason why Nakamoto Consensus does not scale up with more nodes is that every node has to do all the work. If we split up the work over many nodes, then having more nodes means we can split up the work in more pieces, making every piece smaller and thus enabling scaling. So the idea is that an incoming transaction goes to a shard and is processed there. It gets included in the block on this shard and the other shards do not really need to bother about this transaction. But wait, how does this work, if the transaction transfers some coins from an address that is not on this shard? Well, this indeed does not work. There are many possible ways to organize these shards, but luckily this is not a totally new topic for blockchains.

There is massive parallel computing, where many computers solve a heavy computational task together, for example to find signals of extraterrestial intelligence in the radio noise that comes from space (SETI). The other field is databases especially with clustered file systems and massive data storage. The different parts of huge databases, are often called shards, so this is where the naming comes from. In these fields smart researchers have already racked their brains over these problems and the solutions differ depending on what exactly your system should be good at. If you write very often in the database and read only rarely, it makes sense to organize the system so that writing speed maximizes. This means incoming data from a single source often ends up on totally different shards, but that is what allows very fast writing. If you have a lot of requests and these requests represent some kind of condensation of data, it might be a lot better to put data that belongs together on the same shard. For example if you have a database, which stores all data of people living on this planet and requests are something like “give me the average age of people living in all cities”. If the people’s data is distributed according to their living place on shards, then each shard can calculate the data for its cities by itself and then just report back the results for each city. If the data was lying around everywhere, then each shards needs to share the data with each other shard and then the calculation can be done, which is more work.

It even gets more complicated, for example if we want to correlate this information with some other information, like how tall these people are. Then we can’t just sum up their ages and send the sum together with the number of people sampled to the next shard and so on. Then we might need to collect all of that data at some place first and then calculate the complex correlations. If we look at massive parallel computation it is the same story. Basically Bitcoin mining is a huge massive parallel computation operation and synchronizing it is very easy. The reason why this is so easy, is because all of the work does not matter at all, except for the one attempt, that finally found the block. It is somewhat similar for protein folding computation, which is also an example for such a distributed computation task. There the most important result is the one randomly generated parameter set that gives the most stable protein. For SETI the recorded noise can also be distributed quite well on different computers, but there is also the question of frequency involved. If a signal has a wavelength so long that the signal is sent over a duration of 10 years, then it might not be possible to find it, if the recorded noise is split into 100 second long pieces. Of course there are many clever things to be done, but that is not the aim of this article here :D

So how about sharding in blockchains? Well, there is obviously data storage involved and there is computation involved, great. So we have the worst of both worlds. And as luck has it, there is another big pile to be shit on top of that and that is secure computation. In the other examples there is no single entity that acts maliciously or even might be incentivized to do that. So we have data storage, computation and security. All of these must be nice. But we are lucky and we know quite a lot about the data to be stored and the computation to be done. For example for a transaction of coins, one must only check if there are enough coins available for the sender, the receiver is always fine. And the computation of smart contracts can work so that all the data is saved in the smart contract. So whenever someone sends a transaction to a smart contract, then all the data is in one place and not scatterd everywhere. Well, not necessarily all of the data, since a smart contract can also access the data of other smart contracts, but in most cases smart contracts care mostly about it’s own history and transactions sent to it. In addition we know that blockchains are not write heavy tasks. Since writing costs some fee and even though sharded blockchains aim for handling 1000 times more transactions than classical systems, it is still not a database writing GB/s of data. An examples for such a data storage si the CERN Large Hadron Collider experiment.

Looking deep into these eyes, you can see the reflexion of prices moving up

Still we can see now that there are 2 bottlenecks and one important constraint. The bottlenecks are computation and data storage, the constrain is everything must be secure. Taking this into account we end up with an architecture that does not randomly write wherever possible, but rather organizes data together into the same shards that belongs to the same smart contract and addresses interacting with each other and these smart contracts. Ok nice, so we have many shards and the addresses and smart contracts are split up over these shards. For each shard we assign some nodes that propose and validate new blocks. Furthermore when there is cross-shard communication necessary, these nodes send the data around. Sounds fine and not too hard? Well, if we have a fraction of the nodes on each shard, then it is much easier for these nodes to form a cartel or bribe some other nodes to do nasty things. They could just start forging malicious blocks and send this information to other shards, corrupting the whole blockchain. That would be quite bad.

Luckily there is a solution for this and we just shuffle these nodes constantly. If these nodes are exchanged and presented new partners every few seconds, it becomes very hard to collude or bribe others. Since you need some coordination and time to do that, it becomes very hard if constantly new players show up on your shard and you have to move to another shard quite often. In the end you have to collude with everyone and this means that it is as secure as the good old blockchains. Random shuffling also solves another problem, namely that the coordinator of all those shards could also act maliciously by dropping some cross-shard transactions or forging fake cross-shard transactions. By moving around these validators can easily recognize misbehavior of a coordinator node. So everything is fine now with sharding? No. Shuffling has a very delicate implication. It basically means that we have to send all the data of the shard we are leaving to someone else and we need to receive all the data of our new shard. This means a lot of bandwidth.

Alternatively we could store a lot of data, for example of all shards, but then there is no advantage in sharding. If every node has to store everything, there might only be a scaling of computation power, but not of data storage. A single blockchain today is already 100s of GB big, so storing 64 shards or more, might not be that easy and drive out many nodes, leading to centralization, something we don’t want. If we give up decentralization, we don’t need to run a blockchain. Then we can stick to the good old databases. So we either need a lot of data storage or we need a lot of data bandwidth or we need to have nodes stick to the same shards, which leads to inferior security. This is called the Data-Availability-Problem. It is nice to note that this is a trilemma, so instead of an ordinary dilemma, where two options are presented and both are bad, we have now three options, and all of them are bad. Unfortunately for the trilemma, there is a genius solution for this problem.

What is the solution? We can split up the nodes, which have the data and the nodes that validate the blocks. But how does that solve the problem? It is just more data transfer necessary because nodes have been split? Well, the trick is that the data nodes stick to their shard and the validating nodes are randomly shuffled. This means that the data nodes hold all the data of their shard and don’t have to reload new data of other shards all the time. These nodes provide the transactions to form blocks or even propose the blocks, this depends on the specific implementation. But whatever is the case, the validators just take these transactions and forge a block or just check the proposed block. If the validators agree, the block is published. With this approach the validators can be shuffled quite often, so that it is hard to collude. But it is not necessary to transfer huge loads of data all the time. Great, so we have solved sharding? Well, there is still a lot to take care of, but in essence it is possible. We will look at some other finer problems, when we see how it is implemented.",https://medium.com/coinmonks/polkadot-vs-cosmos-vs-ethereum-2-0-for-real-idiots-3b6f0e0cfb2f,['Patrick Wieth'],2022-01-16 17:40:27.943000+00:00,"['Polkadot', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Blockchain', 'Cosmos Network', 'Ethereum']"

TEA Project: 2 Minute Teaser,"The TEA Project is a decentralized cloud computing platform with the scalability to meet the computing needs of the emerging Web3 ecosystem. The TEA Project aims to combine the power of cloud computing with the privacy of a decentralized blockchain solution. Existing blockchains are limited by scalability and cannot meet the large-scale computing needs typical of Web3, and their add-on solutions (such as L2 and sharding) also fall short of the mark. The TEA Project’s use of a two-layer blockchain tailored to run high-frequency Web3 dApps at full speed, from social networks to e-commerce micro-transactions to the metaverse of online games, all while ensuring consumers data privacy.

TEA stands for Trusted Execution and Attestation, and it has a unique method of reaching a trustable consensus. The TEA Project uses consensus not to confirm the result of the dApp’s code; it instead uses consensus to verify the execution environment where the code was run. TEA’s philosophy is that if the execution environment, code, and input data are trusted, then the execution result can also be trusted.

TEA: Two Layers of Consensus for Faster Dapps

The TEA Project is able to achieve blazing fast app execution speed while maintaining decentralization through its novel two-layer blockchain consensus setup. Its layer-1 confirms if a node is trustable by using its onboard hardware TPM chip to perform remote attestation verifying the execution environment where the code was run. The layer-2 blockchain can then run dApps at full speed on nodes that have been confirmed as trustable by layer-1.

The key innovation in the TEA Project’s scalability is the use of a non-BFT consensus algorithm on its layer-2 blockchain. Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) requires blockchains to continually inspect nodes for signs of bad actors. Finding ways to deal with slow processing speeds inherent with BFT is an endemic problem of decentralized systems. Byzantine fault tolerance is still used by TEA’s layer-1 blockchain. The longer times needed to reach consensus on TEA’s layer-1 doesn’t interfere with the faster speeds required on its layer-2. The TEA network only needs to use the Proof of Trust (PoT) data on layer-1 to reach a consensus on the trustability of nodes on layer-2.

In the TEA Project, dApps run Web Assembly code on layer-2 within hardware-protected enclaves. TEA’s root of trust comes from miners’ hardware that forms the distributed nodes of the TEA network. Each mining machine has an embedded TPM chip that generates PoT data, along with a GPS module for Proof of Time for transaction timestamps. The TEA Project uses GPS time to order transactions, reaching finality faster than competing blockchains like Solana. The PoT data is stored on TEA’s layer-1 blockchain. The beauty of this setup comes from the layer-1 trust data that TEA mining nodes can poll to reach consensus. This allows client dApps to run at the speed of a typical cloud computing setup, except these dApps are now fully decentralized on the TEA network.

The Tech Stack Behind TEA’s Layer-1 & Layer-2 Blockchains

TEA’s layer-1 is based on the Substrate framework from Parity Technologies. As a Substrate blockchain, TEA is natively compatible with the Polkadot network. TEA’s layer-1 is also flexible enough to work with any other blockchain.

TEA Project’s layer-2 currently uses the file storage and networking services provided by IPFS. Any current IPFS miner can begin participating in the TEA network by adding a TEA hardware security module (such as a Raspberry Pi with a TPM chip) as well as a GPS module. The TEA Project effectively adds computing services on top of IPFS.

Client blockchains can use TEA as a layer-2 to offload complex computations onto the TEA network. The client blockchain can verify the PoT data on TEA’s layer-1 blockchain to verify that the returned execution result is trustable.

The TEA Project has two tokens; TEA and Camellia (CML). TEA token is a stable utility token as gas, while the Camellia token is an NFT that’s necessary for bringing a TEA mining node online. CML will be prized by investors for its scarcity with only 10,000 CML in the genesis block, and by miners for its ability to generate TEA. We envision a high demand for CML by the participants in the TEA ecosystem and its price will serve as a proxy for the continued growth of the TEA Project platform.

By leveraging the technology of trusted hardware, the TEA Project can achieve the needs of large-scale, high-frequency apps while ensuring permissionless decentralization and privacy protection. It combines the best of both worlds: the security of the blockchain together with the scalability of cloud computing.

Ready to Break up with Valentine’s Day? You’re Not the Only One.,"Last Updated on November 27, 2021 by Carla Jonas

A Valentine’s Day Report from The Pearl Source

It’s that time again — the time for flowers, sparkly bling, red ribbons and an overload of sugary treats. They say love is in the air. But is it really? Valentine’s Day is right around the corner, and in the mist of shopping for the right gift (hello, shiny pearl necklace and matching earrings), it’s the perfect time to ask the right questions. Are we, as consumers, still in love with the romantic holiday? And how do retailers really feel about the love-it-or-hate-it V-Day? The Pearl Source asked all these questions and more in a detailed study on consumer and retailer habits — and the findings were certainly unexpected.

Ah, Valentine’s Day. Romance is in the air. It’s a time of excitement, anticipation, love, and affection. Valentine’s Day has its roots in Christian mythology, originally a celebration of Saint Valentinus. But it wasn’t until the 14th century that the holiday had any romantic connotations, and it took until the 18th century for the idea of gift-giving to take root. As for the chocolate, we have Richard Cadbury, a famous chocolatier, to thank. His bright idea of selling chocolates in a heart-shaped box pioneered the confectionary gift-giving tradition we’re so familiar with now. Eventually brands saw the holiday as a marketing opportunity, creating the environment we know today-filled with jewelry, cards, gifts, teddy bears, and more.

For fans of the consumer holiday, many will likely be ready with flowers, chocolate, and the perfect card for their significant other, ready to shower their partner with the attention they deserve. For others, this holiday is a little less about love and a little more about one thing: anxiety.

For many, Valentine’s Day comes with high expectations and a laundry list of plans to make and items to purchase. From scrambling to find a last minute gift and worrying about securing the perfect romantic dinner spot, to spending yet even more cash right after a busy holiday shopping season, Cupid apparently comes with a lot of stressful baggage — at least for some.

In the study conducted by The Pearl Source, one of the largest online pearl jewelry retailers in the United States, Cupid wasn’t able to win over everyone. Far from it, in fact. As it turns out, Valentine’s Day may be doing more harm than good when it comes to two key areas: relationship health and financial security.

In order to truly understand how people feel about Valentine’s Day, we polled 1,000 men and women across various ages, educational backgrounds, and income levels. Here’s what they had to say.

Valentine’s Day: Love it or Hate it?

VALENTINE’S DAY: LOVE IT OR HATE IT?

30% of respondents say Valentine’s Day is an unnecessary consumer “Hallmark holiday” that forces people to spend money.

Love is very much not in the air. 30% of consumers think Valentine’s Day is an unnecessary “Hallmark holiday” and nearly 15% would completely strike it from their calendars if they could. Men drove this sentiment most. Nearly twice as many men said they’d abolish Valentine’s if they could.

Valentine’s Day and Relationships

For a holiday known for love and romance, quite a few survey respondents felt Cupid put a great deal of strain on their relationship. Not only is it seen as a superficial holiday that speaks out of place, the holiday also raises questions people may not want to address at that time.

20% of all survey respondents said Valentine’s Day is not healthy for their relationship. Of those, nearly 41% said it sets a false reality of what romance is. Surprisingly, more women (45%) felt this way than men (33%). Men’s second-most common reason why Valentine’s Day isn’t healthy? Commitment pressure.

Remember the 30% who thought the holiday was unnecessary? 50% of those respondents said it’s not healthy for relationships.

V-Day Blues: When Cupid Disappoints

40% of all respondents say their partner has disappointed them 70% say they’ve never disappointed a partner

By Gender: Men 63% , Women 77%

The pressure isn’t only in our heads, as most people seem to take a more critical eye towards their partner rather than themselves. 70% of survey respondents said they haven’t disappointed their partner on Valentine’s Day, but 40% said their partner disappointed them. Women win the confidence game, however; nearly 80% of women said they have not ever disappointed a partner on Valentine’s Day, but only 63% of men felt the same way.

Valentine’s Day and Finances

The NRF found that 2019 was a record year for Valentine’s Day spending; the average person dropped $161.96, up from $143.56 the prior year.

When love gets expensive

35% of respondents feel financial strain around Valentine’s Day

Unsurprisingly, cost was one of the biggest issues people had with the holiday. Nearly 35% of consumers said Valentine’s Day puts financial strain on them right after the holidays, with some picking up overtime or extra shifts to pay for it.

What’s the cost?

6% — It’ll have to go on a credit card

7% — I’ll have to borrow some extra funds from a friend or family member

13% — I’ll have to pick up an extra shift/hours/overtime to pay for it

14% — I’m already in debt from the holiday season

(Not) putting their money where their mouth is

Who’s willing to spend over $50 on Valentine’s Day?

Out of all respondents: 47%

Out of those who think VDay is unnecessary: 30%

Of those who said they think Valentine’s Day is unnecessary, only 30% said they were planning to spend over $50, compared to 47% of the general population. However, among the general population and across men and women, the most common budget range for gifts was $25-$50.

And what are they planning to buy? Here are the top three gifts by gender.

Valentine’s Day Self-Love: What we gift ourselves

When looking at the answers of those who would treat themselves to a little something on Valentine’s Day, the top three gifts look a little different. Here are their preferences, by gender.

Valentine’s Day and Retailers

Retailers and e-tailers aren’t feeling the love when it comes to this holiday. Marketing spend tends to increase due to rising advertising costs and a need to stand out among other retailers. According to Mediapost , companies spent 23% more on online search advertising even though consumers only spent 5% more on online purchases. With markdowns and specials eating into profit margins, you might not even be doing your mom and pop shop any favors by participating in the holiday.

The holiday is a tough sell for retailers,

because a lot of jewelry was already just purchased for Christmas so we need to find a compelling reason for people to revisit jewelry for Valentine’s Day. In order to have a new angle on the holiday, we offer a discount promotion for the holiday and look to market new and relevant products. Leon Rbibo, President of The Pearl Source

In a survey of 500 retailers and e-tailers, specifically those in marketing or ecommerce management roles, we found that most feel like they needed to discount and market themselves heavily due to the holiday even though it led to little success. 68% of retailers would do away with the holiday altogether and over 70% felt they needed to spend more to promote discounts, existing promotions, and products.

Retailers show no love for Valentine’s Day

Nearly 90% of retailers said that Valentine’s Day WAS NOT a lucrative holiday for their brand. When asked why, here are the options they selected (respondents were allowed to select more than one option).

Making a monster,"Ray Dillahunty stands next to the largest Audrey II puppet used for the production of ‘Little Shop of Horrors’ at the Port Aransas Community Theatre on Tuesday, Nov. 9. Dillahunty designed and built the puppet for the show. Staff photo by Graysen Golter.

For audiences at the Port Aransas Community Theatre’s (PACT) production of “Little Shop of Horrors,” the monster Audrey II is an R&B-singing, man-eating plant that frightens and entertains all at once.

Behind the scenes, the four puppets used for the plant are a testament to over a year of hard work, practice and ingenuity by more than a dozen people.

The show opened on Thursday, Nov. 4, after the PACT was closed for more than a year due to COVID-19.

Director Ken Yarbrough said the largest puppet exceeded his expectations and that the people behind it are to be commended for their work, ranking it as high as the dragon created for PACT’s production of “Shrek the Musical.”

“That dragon is legendary,” he said. “It had eyes that lit up, it had smoke that came out of its nostrils. It was the best piece that we had ever had on the stage… until Audrey II. Couldn’t be happier. (During shows,) there’s an audible gasp from the audience, then they laugh and they clap. That’s real rewarding when you know that you have done something right.”

Ray Dillahunty works on the frame of one of the Audrey II puppets used for the production of ‘Little Shop of Horrors’ at the Port Aransas Community Theatre in early September. Courtesy photo.

The crew members behind the puppets are Ray Dillahunty and Rick Adams, puppet design and builders; Laura and John Garcia, puppet artwork and Justin Revels, Raina Smith, Aubree Boyer, and Tammy Weidemann, puppeteers. Actor Tre Minor provided the vocals for the character. Volunteers who consistently have helped with the puppets include John Krampitz, Scott Collins and Ed Tobia, Dillahunty said.

Dillahunty said there wasn’t much of a blueprint to work from when designing the puppets, but the delay the coronavirus put on the production allowed him to get creative and use unconventional means to put the Audrey IIs together.

One example is a playground slide that he got from a junkyard, using it for actors to go down when Audrey II “eats” them. Others include using a store- bought Easter egg to mold one of the smaller puppet’s mouth around and making teeth out of bits of a swim noodle.

“This, by far, is the most complicated contraption I’ve made,” he said of the largest puppet. “The best quote Rick ever said was, ‘It’s like building an airplane in midair.’ It’s just a hell of a lot of thinking out of the box.”

The largest puppet is about 4 feet wide and 6 feet long, Dillahunty said, and about 11 feet tall when it reclines into its resting position. In order to make its mouth open and close, puppeteers stand inside the mouth, behind a dark veil, while pushing and pulling two handles.

Minor had been an actor since 2006 before Yarbrough offered him the role of Audrey II in June 2021.

The role wasn’t as simple as talking and singing, Minor said, because he had to coordinate with the puppeteers to make sure the plant’s voice and mouth aligned.

One technique the puppeteers employed was memorizing Minor’s lines, he said. Meanwhile, he would practice the same line with different inflections so that he could react to the puppeteers’ movements.

“ It was a bucket- list role… (and) this is probably right at the top,” Minor said. “Playing Audrey (II) definitely has probably been one of the biggest roles that… I’ve had the opportunity to play.”

For artists Laura and John Garcia, the show was the first time they had ever gotten involved with PACT. While others handled the mechanics and structure of the puppets, the two said they enjoyed being responsible for the aesthetics and making Audrey II look “real” through painting and airbrushing.

“It was awesome,” Laura said. “I’ve seen (the puppets) grow from a piece of plaster… to this real-life thing on stage.”

Hong Kong as the epicenter of Cantonese,"The dialectal density and diversity of Chinese is something that has escaped many people’s attention, since, contrary to widespread popular (mis)conception s of Chinese as bidialectal (Mandarin vs Cantonese), it actually consists of hundreds of thousands of regional dialects that are distributed throughout the Chinese-speaking world. In addition to the wide array of variation among the seven major dialect families — Mandarin, Yue (Cantonese), Hakka, Wu, Min, Xiang and Gan — there is a significant amount of micro-variation among the various sub-varieties of the same dialectal groups.

This has been noted for Cantonese, which, as mentioned before, is not only a major dialect spoken in the southeastern parts of China but also a heritage language in the West, with several generations of speakers in North America. A major dialect like Cantonese consists of numerous sub-dialects that can be distinguished by their unique characteristics and among which there is a range of infinitesimally small micro-variations, as demonstrated in the following rap battle (誰語爭鋒) where local forms of Cantonese from different parts of the Canton province are represented in turn:

This Cantonese rap battle shows the many microvariations between regional varieties in the Canton province.

As urban centers and big cities have great influence in terms of population movement, sociopolitical prestige and (social) media coverage, it is no surprise that the speech of urban communities tends to be taken as the norm and disseminate beyond the boundaries of their precinct. Of all the major urban centers in which Cantonese is spoken (Guangzhou, Dongguan, Shenzhen, Xiamen etc, all of which are represented in the rap video linked above), Hong Kong is without doubt a prominent hub, not only because it is a cosmopolitan international city that attracts visitors from the mainland and all parts of the world, but also because its semi-autonomous status as a Special Administrative Region is such that its societal and sociolinguistic norms are quite different from those of mainland China.

In contrast to the mainland, Hong Kong Cantonese permeates society from top to bottom and is used for nearly all sociolinguistic functions, including many traditionally high (H) functions for which Mandarin is standardly used in the mainland, for example education, public media, and literature. This subtle yet crucial discrepancy in how H functions are conducted between Hong Kong and mainland Cantonese cities carries far-reaching consequences and significance.

As remarked before, the code-switching between Cantonese and Mandarin is not determined purely in terms of geography (HK/Canton versus the rest of China) but also in terms of literary formality, since in addition to being perceived as “local,” Cantonese is also commonly seen as “colloquial/informal/spoken” (even “vulgar”), whereas Mandarin is not only the official lingua franca in mainland China but also the register that underlies the common literary language (白話), which makes it “literary/formal/written”. The use of Cantonese as the language of instruction in both school (primary and secondary) and higher education (university), therefore, is consequential, since children raised in Hong Kong have a relatively high level of Cantonese literacy as compared with their mainland Canton counterparts, and Hong Kong schoolchildren and students have a stronger ability to read, write and recite in Cantonese (as pointed out to me by Dr Sik Dennig, former Cantonese lecturer at Stanford University). Hong Kong children and students also have a wider sensibility and versatility in their use of Cantonese as they are able to tailor and adapt their Cantonese for discussing a range of topics, both informal (mundane) and formal (academic), all in Cantonese, including Mandarin-based literary Chinese (白話). Mainland Cantonese speakers, however, have been shown to have a lower ability in using Cantonese for formal academic discussions, which can be explained by the fact that they use Mandarin at school for all academic subjects. The other side of the coin is that mainland Cantonese speakers do have a significantly higher level of proficiency and fluency in Mandarin than people in Hong Kong, but as argued before, there are still good reasons for keeping the status quo of Cantonese education in Hong Kong, since the level of Mandarin in the city can be raised effectively by implementing foreign language teaching methods of Mandarin, which is in line with the fact that Mandarin is mainly used in Hong Kong when dealing with external visitors such as those from the mainland (in effect rendering Mandarin a super-H/foreign variety).

Another major use of Cantonese is in public media, that is, literature, journalism, television, radio and cinema, where Cantonese is standardly used for official announcements, such as news coverage and press releases, and different forms of entertainment such as TV shows, films, books, magazines and plays. The former ties in with the use of Cantonese in schools as described above, since people in Hong Kong have acquired the ability to conduct formal discourse and use literary Chinese in Cantonese, while the latter has given rise to artistic and commercial products in Cantonese that have become crucial in disseminating Cantonese to other parts of the world. The use of Cantonese in the Hong Kong entertainment industries has a profound effect in promoting Cantonese abroad, since such media products as Cantonese music (Cantopop), films, and TV series have entered the mainland and foreign markets, which has increased global awareness and familiarity of Hong Kong Cantonese. One major incentive for learning Cantonese among foreigners is their interest in and exposure to Cantonese forms of art and entertainment, which has inspired many people both in the mainland and abroad to learn Cantonese. Hong Kong Cantonese media and written products (books, magazines, comics, music, TV shows, films) are also instrumental in preserving cultural heritage in Cantonese-speaking diasporic communities abroad, since Hong Kong publications are immensely popular among expats in the West who rely on these for cultural connection. It is without doubt that Hong Kong Cantonese is a major driving force in the internationalization of Cantonese, and the quotidian nature of Cantonese in Hong Kong not only has a robust effect in preserving Cantonese within Hong Kong but is also replicated abroad in the commercialization of media merchandise.

One final important aspect of Hong Kong Cantonese is the formalization, establishment and education of Cantonese as a linguistic variety in its own right, since the study of Cantonese linguistics has become a major field of research in Hong Kong universities. The formal academic study of Cantonese did not begin in Hong Kong, since from as early as Chao Yuen Ren scholars were already interested in comparing Chinese dialects, as seen in Chao’s seminal Mandarin and Cantonese primers. In recent years, however, while the study of Cantonese has become a research topic of international reach as there have been international conferences organized exclusively and specifically for Cantonese linguistics, academics in Hong Kong universities have initiated some radically important developments that have revolutionized the study, research and teaching of Cantonese. An example is the formal description of Cantonese grammars at different levels and the formal definitive codification of Cantonese phonemes and phonology — yuetping (粵拼) — which are among the pioneering developments in promulgating the study of Cantonese both in Hong Kong and beyond. Such formal descriptions of Cantonese grammar and pronunciation are highly influential as they have provided a standardized way for referencing and teaching Cantonese (on a par with Mandarin pinyin) and vastly facilitated the learning and teaching experience of Cantonese. All this is a credit to the many scholars based in Hong Kong universities whose work on Cantonese has modernized the teaching and research in Cantonese and thereby improved its credentials as an object of study for foreigners and locals alike.

In this piece, I have tried to show that Hong Kong, being a predominantly Cantonese-speaking city where that language is used from top to bottom (sociolinguistically speaking), is especially powerful both for the maintenance of Cantonese as a unique and independent linguistic variety and the exportation of Cantonese to other parts of the world, which can all be tied to the various H functions that are uniquely conducted in Cantonese in Hong Kong, namely education, media and research. Contemporary Hong Kong, therefore, serves as a model of how Cantonese is conducted as the predominant language variety in society that can be exported and replicated abroad, as seen in the various Cantonese-speaking expat communities scattered all around the world.

China's Plan for Total World Domination,"""Let the Lion Sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world"", is a quote famously attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte where he refers to China as a Lion; this article will be an inquiry into how true this statement holds and what Bonaparte's prophecy means for China and The World.

In this article, we will discuss Chinese Ideology, the vision of the CCP for the next century, and how it plans to achieve this using Chinese Foreign Policy (CFP), and other strategies. This article is purely objective and should not be construed as the personal opinions of the author

We study the past to understand the present and we understand the present to guide the future. So to take a look at China's vision for the future and to understand where we are headed from here, we need to take a look at what led us to this point, and how we arrived here. What were the guiding principles of China? What has shaped its present and set it up on the path for the future? China is poised for a meteoric rise in the coming decade, and this is all thanks to the vision of the leaders at the helm of the Chinese Dragon Boat. Visions of world domination have always been a recurring theme in the communist ideology, tracing origins back to Karl Marx. For China, this is blended with its long history. To the outside world, it isn't clear whether this is simply rhetoric to keep the Chinese peasantry in line or if China sees this as their destiny, and Xi Jinping believes he is the leader who will deliver this vision.(Hille, 2020) With thousands of years of continuous history, Ancient China to date is unabated as one of the world's most significant players, in terms of trade, population, and culture. In the book, ""The Hundred-Year Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower"", Micheal Pilsbury goes into depth about China's plan for world domination. And how they aim to do this by 2049, the centennial of China's communist revolution. So the theory being discussed in this article is neither a foreign one nor a conspiracy theory as some Chinese mouthpieces may claim it to be. It is rooted in evidence and statistical data. To understand how China arrived at this point, let's dive into the Cold War era, where the generation of Xi Jinping was coming of age. The birth of Xi Jinping was around the same time as the start of the Cold War, and during those years China was a huge, impoverished nation. In the 1970s as China slowly started opening up to the west, it gradually unfolded itself and by the 1990s China wanted to step into the modern world along with the rise of Globalization. In 1980 Chinese GDP was under $90 billion in current dollars, whereas today it is over $12 trillion. This kind of exponential economic growth is unprecedented. Simultaneously In the 1990s the Internet was booming and the Soviet Union seemed to have collapsed, the US, as a sole superpower exploited these opportunities and shifted large parts of its production to lower-cost countries which ushered in the aforementioned era of Globalization. The Western world arrogantly thought that everyone else wanted to be like them, as looking back their ideas seemed to have made sense. They won WW2 and the Cold War with their technology and overzealous ideals of freedom and democracy. To the Americans, their way seemed the best, but apart from the Americans that hadn't seemed so obvious to people elsewhere, especially China.

Beijing may have admired American achievements, but not enough to abandon Communism. China seems to have adapted and rebranded its idea of Freedom. Modern Communism is quite distant from Maoism. The -ism that present-day CCP has gone with is ""Xiism"" (as I like to call it) or ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era"" also abbreviated as Xi Jinping Thought; as most people refer to it, is understood to be a dynamic, capitalistic, totalitarian, top-down structure with rigid rules and social restrictions. The Xi Jinping Thought consists of 14 principles, which can be found in this BBC article His own words: The 14 principles of 'Xi Jinping Thought'. This ideology is largely seen to be the guiding principle for the rising Chinese Star. All these seem to be rapidly happening since 2013 when Xi ascended the throne and took office as the President of China. Much of his thought seems to come from his 2013 speech where he discusses Marx and Mao, China's place in history and the competition of the state with other capitalistic nations, and a plea to adhere to Communism.

Xi is also seen to be consolidating power and is seen as the most powerful Chinese leader, especially since the ending of the two-term limit for presidents. Pre Xi, leaders mainly focussed on a collective leadership image, Xi seems to have departed from it and moved into a cult of personality. With books, cartoons, mass media, and propaganda honoring his rule. He has also set up many administrative bodies and appointed himself in key positions which help him dish out his agenda more effectively. Most notable he is the leader of the cyber security and internet policy body, and the National Security Commission of the CCP gives him control over the internet and national security affairs. So we can see how internally and externally this affects Chinese foreign policy.

In pure numbers, China is set to overtake the US economy in less than a decade. This is in large part thanks to China's accelerated production and growth, coupled with the USA's plateauing economy, as is the case for developing and developed economies respectively. We will also be taking a look at how China is growing, not just by ramping up production within its borders but by also playing a strategic game of Wei Qi ( or Go in English) on the world stage. To understand Strategic behavior, we must decode strategic thinking. Thinking that originates from a nation's history and culture. It is a uniquely Chinese game that is believed to be the oldest board game in the world, having originated 2500 years ago in China. The goal of the game is to slowly and patiently build up assets and tip the game in one's favor. The strategic end is not full victory, but relative victory and is a long strategy game. In English, it translates to a game of surrounding pieces. This might sound eerily familiar, China is playing this game in real-time, In real life. We just have to take a look at the activity in the South China Sea, surrounding pieces, and usurping assets that they do not own. (""WION — Does This Board Game Explain China's Expansionist Strategy?"" |2020) China has had a long history of strategic acumen being used by Leaders, including the immortalization of the book, The Art of War by the Ancient military general and strategist, Sun Tzu. In recent years, the world has seen a rightward pro-aggressive nationalism shift on the political spectrum with China being no exception. You have Modi for India, Trump for the USA, Bolsanaro for Brazil, Boris for the UK, et al. And all of these leaders subscribe to a similar school of thought. Xi has adopted a hard-line on security and foreign affairs, appearing to be a more assertive and nationalistic player. It has even been termed the wolf warrior diplomacy by some academicians, referring to a Rambo-style Chinese movie by the same name. In comparison, the prior Chinese diplomatic practice was to avoid controversy and the use of cooperative rhetoric. The present style seems to be confrontational and combative and given China's size and ability to bully other players, it comes as no surprise that Xi is ramping up this diplomacy style. Ironically Wolf Warrior 2's tagline is ""Whoever attacks China will be killed no matter how far the target is."" The Chinese Foreign Ministry is one of the organs increasingly employing aggressive diplomacy tactics. This diplomacy has been noticed since 2017 and has increased in the run-up to Covid. European leaders have also been taken by surprise because now China is engaging with them in a tone of opposition rather than collaboration, where previously this style of dialogue would have been reserved for smaller or weaker countries (Hille, 2020). This is characterized by an incident late last year, where the foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian posted a photo of a child having their throat slit by an Australian soldier (Rej, n.d.). This was understood by political analysts as an attempt to escalate the Chinese-Australian dispute. Reuters reported that the Australian PM termed this post repugnant and that the Chinese government should be ashamed of this post. The next day the foreign ministry rejected the demand for an apology. Furthermore, the engagement of Chinese diplomats on Twitter has also grown fourfold from April 2019 to April 2020. A culmination of these foreign policies and ideologies in the past year has seemed to manifest itself very aggressively. It has taken a rather dramatic and sinisterly aggressive turn. It has lashed out at Australia, for questioning its handling of the Covid 19 Pandemic, tightened its hold in the South China Sea, clashed with India in regions like Aksai Chin and the Himalayas, deployed warplanes across the median line in the Taiwan Strait, and even boosted patrol around Japanese controlled Islands. Within Hong Kong, we are no stranger to China increasing its grip over the autonomous region in recent times. We have observed and been witness to the crackdowns on free speech and dissent within the SAR. It has enacted a far-reaching national security law and arrested multiple pro-democracy activists in the process. This is the most striking of all as Hong Kong has for a long time been treated as its special region, but the Pearl of the Orient seems to be rescinding its status as a world city and is slowly falling back into the shadow of the Mainland.

Moving on, we have gathered a brief understanding of What China's guiding principles are, a brief rundown of its ideologies, and what its internal system looks like. To answer the questions of What? Why? And How? We have understood the 'What' and the 'Why', now let's take a look at the 'How'? To recap: ● What? Chinese World Domination ● Why? Chinese ideology and Rejuvenation of the Chinese dream. ● HOW? What strategies and techniques are being used? Strategic Trade routes and economic relations with other players. How does China plan to dominate global trade? A few key concepts we will be exploring are the String of Pearl's theory, the Belt and Road Initiative, Debt Trap diplomacy, and the Salami slicing strategy. The String of Pearl's theory is a geopolitical theory of how China plans to strategically place points of control and the Chinese intentions in the Indian Ocean region. In theory, a pearl refers to a military base, mega infrastructure project, economic corridor, or other such locales where China has a geostrategic advantage.The string of these pearls refers to China's possibility to connect these pearls via a maritime route.Chinese development over the last quarter-century has been heavily dependent on foreign sources of energy, and sustained growth would require a consistent energy source. To meet future demand, China has signed several projects to develop Iranian Oil Fields and to build a pipeline, port, and refinery in Sudan for oil exports. International responses have been varied and accusatory towards China. But China seems to view its actions in an entirely different light, calling it an effort to establish and strengthen the efforts of a Maritime Silk Route. China ramping up its economic investments has raised concerns about the political stability of the countries they are investing in. Secondly, we need to look at the Belt and Road initiative or the BRI which is the second piece to the puzzle of China's trade route, along with the Maritime Silk route. It is considered the centerpiece of the CCP's foreign policy under Xi Jinping. We can term it as Xi's crown jewel, it is a global infrastructure development strategy adopted in early 2013 to invest in nearly 70 countries and international organizations. Some estimates peg the amount to be invested by 2027 to be nearly $1.3 Trillion, which is a mind-boggling amount. The project also has a completion date of 2049, which coincides with the centennial of the PRC. Many observers including the US, interpret it as a plan for a Sinocentric international trade network. Simply put China is trying to buy friendship and political influence by building and investing massive amounts of money in infrastructure projects along with the One Belt One Road initiative. The stated objective is to construct a unified large market whilst making full use of the international and domestic markets, through cultural exchange and to enhance mutual understanding and trust among members resulting in a pattern of capital inflow, talent pools, and technology databases.(The Belt and Road Initiative, n.d.) It has even been incorporated into the constitution of China in 2017, the CCP calls this a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future. There has been a range of mixed reactions, from many African countries seeing this as their ticket to independence from foreign aid and foreign influence. More than 130 countries have issued endorsements.Many countries support this and see it as a way to boost trade. But some pockets have heavily opposed this and leveled accusations of neocolonialism against the Chinese State. Some western countries have accused the BRI of being predatory and neocolonialistic in nature due to China's debt-trap diplomacy to fund the infrastructure projects of the initiative Next, we will discuss what debt-trap diplomacy is and why China is engaging in it. Simply put, debt-trap diplomacy is a theory to describe a powerful lending institution or country seeking to saddle a borrowing state with enormous debt to increase leverage over it. The term is attributed to an Indian Academic Brahma Chellaney in early 2017 and has widely garnered traction to describe China's lending policies. In simple terms, this Chinese development policy is called the Debt Trap diplomacy, because once indebted economies fail to repay their loans, they are pressured to support China's geostrategic interests (Abi-Habib & Bradsher, 2020). In April 2019 China released a Debt Sustainability Framework which has been described as being virtually identical to that of the World Bank and the IMF(Center For Global Development, n.d.). Oftentimes China has also been accused of imposing unfair trade and financial deals when cash-poor countries are unable to do without Beijing's money. China has also been accused of requiring secret negotiations and non-competitive pricing on projects, in which bidding is often closed and must go to Chinese players. Lastly, we will be taking a look at the Salami slicing strategy being used by China. It refers to a series of many small actions, none of which warrant heavy opposition by itself, but the cumulative result is a large one that would be difficult or unlawful to perform all at once. The String of Pearl's theory is seen to be a manifestation of this strategy. The BRI and its debt-trap diplomacy are said to be the economic slice of the strategy. It has various other dimensions such as culture and demographic slicing ( Sinicization and Re-education of minority groups), and Territory Slicing ( Indian dispute in the Himalayas, etc) among other things. Throughout this article, we have observed many aspects of China's salami-slicing strategy, keeping this in mind If we were to re-read the article: we would look at the bigger picture and be able to connect the dots and see that China is making its moves in a calculated manner. ""Today, the lion has woken up. But it is peaceful, pleasant, and civilized,"" said Chinese President Xi Jinping while addressing a meeting in Paris. Indeed it looks like Napoleon Bonaparte's prophecy has been fulfilled (China, The Sleeping Lion Has Woken Up, Says Xi Jinping, 2014). In Conclusion, China is going to become a force to reckon with in the near future. And if any other nations want to challenge its dominance, they have to act fast and they have to act first. Some might speculate that it is already too little, too late, and to better ally with China rather than oppose. Indeed this may be true and the rejuvenation of the Chinese Dream is en route, and Xi Jinping will deliver China to the Promised Land. In 2049, Xi will be 95 and the PRC would be celebrating its centennial anniversary. 2049 seems to be the grand milestone and culmination date for a lot of Chinese Milestones, it should come as no surprise that this is going to be the greatest year in Modern Chinese history. The realization of many of the dreams of Xi and the Chinese Dream seems to be on schedule. Love him or hate him, there is no denying that this man has left a mark on China's history and has ushered in China's most significant era in modern history.",https://medium.com/@yusufshah/chinas-plan-for-total-world-domination-46ed05d38e3d,['Yusuf Shah'],2022-01-09 21:26:46.599000+00:00,"['Us China Relations', 'Chinese', 'China', 'Geopolitics', 'Foreign Policy']"

How to get started on Online Casinos In South Africa.,"South Africans, like most people, enjoy playing at the Casino for different reasons. While some may gamble to catch fun and connect with people, others do it to solve their financial problems.

Today, casinos now host their games online. As a result, South African players can invite their friends to play along and enjoy gambling from anywhere.

However, with government restrictions on online gambling in the country, it is difficult for South Africans to make money playing online casinos.

So, if you’re new to the world of online casinos in South Africa, you’re in the right place.

This article will discuss online casinos in South Africa, how they work, how you can make money with online casinos, and lots more.

Let’s dive in.

What are online casinos in South Africa?

Online casinos in South Africa are the virtual version of traditional brick-and-mortar casinos. These virtual gambling sites allow players to wager on games and withdraw their earnings from anywhere in South Africa.

The top online casinos in South Africa host hundreds of games. From the classic 3D online roulette, video poker, slots, and craps to unique arcade and Asian games,-these gamble sites offer a fun and gratifying experience.

Some online casinos even publish their payout and win percentage ratings on their website so that potential players know they are legit and what to expect.

Now, let’s talk about how they work. Shall we?

How online casinos in South Africa work

Online casinos in South Africa are hosted on the internet, allowing players to play different games against each other. They are either web-based, download-based online casinos, or both.

A web-based casino is powered by your web browser’s plugin, making it ready to play without you downloading any software on your devices.

However, to enjoy a smooth gaming experience on web-based casinos, you need a fast internet connection to load the graphic components quickly.

Download-based casino games, on the other hand, are played on mobile and desktop devices. To play these games, you need to download and set up the casino app.

Also, software components like the graphics, sound, and user data required to play the game are stored on the device’s internal storage. As a result, download-based casino games may run smoother and faster than web-hosted casinos.

Notwithstanding, both types of online casinos use a technology known as a random number generator (RNG).

The RNG is software designed to turn out a sequence of unpredictable numbers. Therefore, the numbers make up your winning combination for table games like blackjack.

Is online casino in South Africa legal?

It is illegal to own or participate in online casinos in South Africa. In 2010, the National Gambling Board (NGB) in South Africa enacted a strict policy against online gambling.

Nevertheless, hundreds of online casinos outside the country allow South Africans to play and make money without problems. Some of these offshore online casinos are advertised as South African owned.

As a result, online gambling and casinos are booming today in South Africa, with hundreds of people registering daily.

Most of the time, the NGB can only take action against the operators- but they are not residents in the country.

It is important to avoid processing your payment via the local banks to play safely in South Africa. That is because local banks in South Africa are not permitted to carry out transactions with online casinos outside the country. So instead, use digital wallets to fund your casino accounts(more on this below).

What South Africans should know before registering on an online casino

There are hundreds of casinos on the internet for South Africans. They all put up flashy web pages advertising enticing promotions and bonuses, which is not bad.

Since the country has banned online casinos, you may fall victim to fake offshore sites seeking to exploit you. As a new player, you may easily fall for a scam on some websites. Or worse, have your personal information and credentials stolen.

To avoid a red-face moment like that, these are the five most important things you should check before playing online casino games.

License and registration

The best online casinos in South Africa hold an operating license and are regulated by an official body.

These operators know that having a license gives them an edge because players trust them more than their unlicensed competitors. Because of that, they would happily display a license badge on their website.

Therefore, a casino website with no license is potentially harmful, so you know you should not deposit your money or input your personal information on such a website.

Website Safety

“Is this website safe?”

This is another question to ask before spending your money on an online casino.

Even though a casino website itself may not want to harm users, hackers can break in and steal user information and money if it is not adequately protected.

A quick way that we recommend for you to quickly screen out unsafe websites is to check if the website has SSL encryption enabled.

Think of this SSL certificate as a digital certificate showing that a website is secure. With this certification, you can rest assured that information sent between your browser and the website cannot be read by someone else.

Secured online casinos for South Africans have a padlock displayed before their URL in your browser to show that they are safe to use.

Quality of games

Even if a casino website is safe and licensed, it will be of little benefit if your chosen game is not available. Therefore, an online casino committed to its players’ satisfaction should offer all types of games.

The best online casino games in South Africa host all games, including traditional titles like Poker, Roulette, Baccarat. Bingo, Keno, BlackJack, and Slots.

The slot is the most widely played casino game online because it’s easy to learn and doesn’t require complex calculations in games like Poker. So you can quickly get started with that if you’re new to online gambling.

Welcome Bonuses and Promotions

Welcome bonuses are like a birthright for all online gamblers. That’s because casino websites know that giving you an excellent first impression through enticing welcome bonuses goes a long way to determine how much time you commit to playing their games.

There are many South African online casinos offering great deals and bonuses for new players.

To ensure that these welcome gifts are fair and realistic, you should also read a couple of reviews from South African players about the casino website.

Easy Deposits and Withdrawals

There is no point playing online casinos if you cannot trust the casino website to send your winnings as scheduled.

A casino website with a reputation for slow deposit and withdrawal may not be worth your time.

However, popular casinos for South Africans mentioned in this article seamlessly process their players’ earnings and support the South African local currency (ZAR).

Also, knowing the restrictions on online casinos in South Africa ensures using a supported banking method to avoid problems.

Reliable Customer Service

An online casino website that is committed to supporting its users will not compromise on its customer service.

The best online casinos for South Africans have a reliable support network through live chats, emails, FAQs, Online calls, etc.

In that mind, you should be able to file a complaint and get instant feedback any time of the day or week.

Device Compatibility

You should be able to wager on a game anywhere at any time as long as your mobile device is compatible with the network requirements of online casinos.

Most of the casinos where South Africans play online supports Androids, iPhones, and Windows operating systems.

So you don’t have to sweat yourself about that.

Suitable payment method

An ideal casino website will offer its players various methods to withdraw their earnings.

Do you prefer a cash check, gift cards, coupons, or direct bank transfer?

South Africans enjoy the best time on online casinos offering all of these payment methods. Some of them will even allow you to donate to a charity if you’re that kind of person.

Customer Reviews

No online casino is perfect. But there is a minimum standard for quality service all casino websites should fulfill.

And it’s only through user reviews you can judge whether an online casino meets these standards.

The online casinos we recommend in this article are certified by independent regulators, and South Africans recommend them. So you don’t have to worry about that.

How to get started with online casinos in South Africa

You need to create an account to get started with online casinos in South Africa. Creating an account is free, and you can complete the process in under 5 minutes.

Although the registration process for South African casinos may vary slightly, the following paragraphs show what you can expect on most of the sites.

Firstly, after you’ve chosen a suitable South African casinos website to play, click sign up.

Secondly, input your first name, last name, email address and set a strong password to protect your account.

The next step is to complete a short biodata form with your street address, gender, mobile number, country, postal code, etc.

Lastly, confirm that you agree to the terms and conditions for using the online casino’s website and click “register.”

And that’s it, you now have a secured online casino website, and you can start playing from anywhere in South Africa.

Note: Some casino sites require that you deposit money into your account before you start playing, while others allow free play.

Once you start playing, all your winnings are sent to your account on the website, where you can withdraw them using any payment method of choice.

How A Simple Notepad Can Change Your Life,"A person likes to improve himself. He is looking for ways and methods, sometimes complex, often simple. He is willing to spend a lot of money. Trying to catch a crane in the sky, not realizing that the tit is his happiness, is in his hands. And you don’t need a lot of money for this tit. And all you need is nothing — buy a notebook. And a little time and effort to write down your thoughts in it.

Some will consider it complete nonsense. Others will think they don’t need to write anything because they don’t complain about their memory. No. It won’t work. Our brain sees and perceives differently on paper. What is recorded helps to better organize and clarify your thoughts.

So what do you need to write in your notebook?

1. Write down what you are looking forward to.

People who know how to dream are happier. Make your plans and “castles in the air”, but be sure to write them down. People who are just thinking about an upcoming purchase or vacation, endorphin levels rise by 27 percent. After all, the most enjoyable part of the activity is waiting. And when you need a charge of happiness, just look in the notebook.

2. Record your progress.

Whenever you decide to do something, write down your forecast. What you expect to see. After six months or a year, compare the practical result with your expectation. You will see what has changed for the better and what for the worse. What should you pay more attention to, what habits interfere with in order to get the desired result.

By writing down your goals and obstacles in their path, you increase the hope of success. Such recordings will make you healthier and happier.

Everyone has goals, but few people write them down. Why? Because people take it too seriously and therefore are afraid to jinx it. No need to worry. Goals may change, but at the same time, if in doubt, they will be a guide in decision-making.

When identifying opportunities, do not waste time improving those skills in which you are incompetent. Instead, focus on your strengths. Making notes about your preferences and experiences will help turn a notebook into a personal reference. Based on it, you will be able to make more informed decisions in the future.

3. Write down your ideas.

Why did all the great people keep notebooks in which they wrote down their thoughts, doubts, decisions? They didn’t rely on their memory. They trusted paper more. Their creativity began with brief notes, which, accumulating, spilled out into powerful projects.

Have a thought? Good or bad — it doesn’t matter. Write it down. Even if it will never come in handy.

4. Record your worries and doubts.

What is written on paper, unlike internal thinking, helps not only to calm down, but even to increase productivity. Write down not only your problems, but also a plan for how to deal with them. It is quite possible that a completely different solution will be found as a result. But it (the solution) it will already be based on what was recorded.

5. Write down the good things that happen to you.

In the evening, take ten minutes to your notebook. Write down just three things that went well today and why they went so well. They don’t have to be epochal. But they must be important to you.

Next to each positive event, ask why it happened and give an answer. It will take a few minutes. Just make sure to do it in writing.

By rethinking your life events in the past, you can change your behavior in the future.",https://medium.com/@arturkh/how-a-simple-notepad-can-change-your-life-99abc868aed3,['Artur Kh.'],2022-01-24 09:31:40.804000+00:00,"['Self Development', 'Simple Living', 'Lifehacks', 'Self Improvement', 'Life']"
Optimism Can Make You Feel Better,"Hey there­­ you— Here is a secret. Get excited!

Look. You can live longer, stronger, happier, and more creatively. Right now. Instantly. Guaranteed.

Listen. No one is the same. Your truth is your passion. But finding the right fit can be a lonely dance.

Start by becoming more optimistic. Researchers found optimism had a remarkable impact on physical health. Heart disease, immunity, cancer, pregnancy outcomes, pain tolerance.

People with more optimistic outlooks had better results and did better in the long run than pessimistic people. Having a positive attitude boosts physical health, no matter the problem.

Optimism is timeless and global. Nelson Mandela called it heading for the sun one step at a time. Let it burn your eyes. Sometimes you will fail. You are the future, bright and powerful.

Benjamin Franklin explains it like this. We can’t control all that happens to us, but we can control what happens inside us. In the future you will fail much better.

So be a bulldog. Like Winston Churchill. Because it does not seem to be much use to be anything else.

You will grow stronger. Here is a haiku gift to get started. These describe things I found extraordinary in the mundane, sand, boats, dogs, cats, sheets, love, laundry. They can be useful for wrapping your head around things, or opening your mind.

"Change your habits, change your future","Creatures of habits as we are, we love to dwell in the past and often feel that that defines us. We couldn’t be more wrong.

Photo by Hadija Saidi on Unsplash

A study showed we have around 6,000 conscious thoughts a day (‘thought worms’ as the researchers call it).

“I feel a bit under the weather, do I have corona? Would I end up at the ICU? Could it really kill me?”

“Damn, it’s cold. Why don’t I live in a place where it’s warmer? The Caribbean or something… that would be nice. Damn cold weather.”

“I wonder what Jane thinks of me when I tell her I bought these new shoes. She’s probably saying she likes them and telling Carol I have no taste. What a bitch.”

You know, the important stuff…

Hopefully, you also have some uplifting thoughts, like:

“I look good today in that new dress shirt!”

Or: “There, booked. Spain, here I come. I love it when I can just go on a short vacation and have the freedom to do so.”

Chances are though, most of your conscious thoughts aren’t all that positive. Because our mind is generally speaking more focused towards the negative. And it should, because the only task of the brain is to keep you alive, so it’s programmed to look for potential danger.

That is if you keep running it on autopilot.

The autopilot is turned on by the subconscious mind. You don’t actively decide to think something, therefore we call that the subconscious mind. And that’s where most things happen.

Once we have repeated a thought worm long enough, it becomes a habitual thought, and it kind of just happens.

The worries you have, the reminder of that pain in your left shoulder, the decision to scroll your social media feed, etc.

Most thoughts we have are habitual thoughts.

The total number of thoughts we have in a day has never been scientifically been discovered, although numbers between 20,000 up to 80,000 spread over the internet. And that’s all right, it doesn’t really say anything. Important though is, that all our neurological pathways make us think and feel. If indeed we have around 6,000 active thoughts, it means that most of the thoughts we have, has its source from our (habitual) subconscious mind.

And our thoughts (and feelings accordingly), determine our actions.

So the results we see every day, are the results of these actions.

That means, if we don’t like these results, and want different ones, we should change these habitual thoughts and feelings.

So, change your habits, to change your results.

But how on earth do we do that, if most of these thoughts are happening without us even noticing them?

Well, that’s exactly the first step to take. Start noticing them.

By creating awareness, and then reverse engineering it, using our senses and something called ‘anchoring’.

An anchor is a trigger that leads to a combination, a train of events. One good example is our taste. If we see food, our brain triggers hormones that will increase our saliva. You are preparing yourself for eating the food. And that anchor is so strong, that even the thought of food alone, can do that.

Let’s do a little thought experiment: Think of a lemon. See yourself in the kitchen, cutting the lemon in half, picking up one half, and taking a huge bite out of it.

What just happened? Did you notice the increase of saliva in your mouth?

That’s the result of an anchor.

When we become aware we have these anchors then we can redesign the train of events following the anchor.

Let me give you an example.

Every morning when I drove to work, there was, at some point in the road, a hole in the road. Not being fully awake, I always forgot where that was, and a big KADUNK of my wheel hitting that hole in the road. Every morning. Only then realizing again there was that hole again.

So I decided to put an anchor on the event ‘do not hit the hole’.

Photo by Taha on Unsplash

The next day, it happened again, and I quickly realized I needed an anchor. I saw that about 50 meters behind the hole in the road, there was a parking sign, next to the road. So I actively started thinking: “When I see that parking sign, I know there’s a hole in the road.” and repeated that over and over again for about 5 minutes.

The next day, I saw the parking sign and steered around the hole.

Up till today, when I see that parking sign at that road, I think of that hole (that has been fixed for years now). It’s the power of an anchor.

You can use this same technique to reprogram any anchor.

How to reprogram an anchor

Let’s say you want to cut on the amount of sugar you eat since there are a lot of health benefits to that. Sugar or sweet food has anchors all over the place. The nice taste, the way it makes you feel in the moment, and all kinds of biological processes that keep the train of events alive.

So we want to reprogram that anchor.

What if you would connect sugar with poison? Would you eat poison?

Hopefully not. Because instant death will probably occur. Now, from the health perspective, isn’t sugar doing the same thing, in the long run? If you agree with that idea, why not connect the term ‘poison’ to sugar?

So next time you are in the store looking at the cookies, say to yourself: “These cookies are like poison to my body.” And keep repeating that for as long as you can see the cookies. Or candy. Or the Pain du Chocolat. Or even the bottle of ketchup (which contains also a lot of sugar).

By doing that for a week, I guarantee you that you will not buy those cookies anymore.

You’ve reprogrammed your habitual thought from “I want it, it’s not that bad” to “That will kill me, I’m not eating that.”

Now, it does take time to really make this into a belief system. Old patterns don’t die easily. So if you don’t keep reprogramming yourself, the old habit will return.

Studies showed that these habit changes take about 66 days on average. For some more, for some less. But to really build it as a full habit that comes from the whole body, it may take up to a full year before it has overruled any other old habit. So, know it might take a while, and don’t be discouraged if it’s not working after 2 weeks.

Habits, beliefs, action and results

Habits come from our past actions, which we kept repeating. Actions that came from the way we think.

Habitual thoughts are called ‘beliefs’. Thoughts you have been repeatedly thinking, and therefore have become true to you.

A belief is what you think is true.

It’s not a matter of the truth, because for you it is. We have thousands of beliefs. Of whom we think we are, what we’re good at or not, our religion, how we feel about money, our job, our love life, what healthy food is, what you like or love, your whole life is built on beliefs.

And those beliefs come from our experiences, what people tell us (parents, friends, society), and the thoughts that we connect to them. An experience will be added with older beliefs we already had, and add it up to a new belief, based on the experience. Makes sense, right?

So if you agree with all this (which is also a belief funny enough), then you can also imagine that when we change a belief, we will change our habits, so we will change our actions, and therefore our results.

We’ve seen that in our subconscious mind, most things are running on autopilot. We’ve programmed it that way for the most part.

The beauty is that our subconscious mind just has to accept the (conscious) thoughts we’re putting in there. It has to, it’s how it’s learning.

And it doesn’t care what kind of thoughts they are. Positive or negative, it will accept them all.

If we only feed it with our past experiences, our results we had in that past, it will always keep chasing the rabbit and be totally reactive to the circumstances. You can’t get in front of the game.

Change the predicted future

What would happen if we start feeding the subconscious mind with what we would want to happen? If we feed it, with the same intent as our experiences, where we’ve truly lived it and felt it, then that subconscious mind also has to accept it as being true and part of a new belief. A new habit. A new anchor.

As we’ve seen with the example of the cut-in-half-lemon, our subconscious mind doesn’t know the difference between if it is real or just a thought. It will fires the same hormones, create the same feelings as if it is real.

So when you imagine what you want to have, or experience, or create in your future, and see it, feel it and believe it as if it is happening right now, you are actively changing your subconscious mind.

And that works for any belief you have, for any result you currently experience. Your love life, your career, the amount of money you make, losing weight, literally everything.

It is like you are reprogramming the matrix, as Neo is doing in the movies.

Hacking your own matrix. Your own subconscious mind has created your reality, your world, based on your habits and beliefs.

So change your habits, both the actions and your thoughts, and you can change your future.

Introduction

Marty Neumeier:

‍Understanding how brands work will make your work so much more powerful and give you access to better projects, because you’re thinking in a way that matters to a business.

Arek Dvornechuck:

‍What’s up branding experts? Arek here at Ebaqdesign, and my guest today is Marty Neumeier. And Marty is a brand consultant now, but he began his career as a designer working for over 15 years in brand design and advertising and soon he added writing and strategy to his repertoire. And move to Silicon valley to work with big bands like Apple, Adobe, Kodak, HP and hundreds of others. And now Marty works as a director or CEO Branding at Liquid Agency. And Marty has also written several best-selling books, including “The Brand Gap”, which is a book outlining how to bridge the distance between brand strategy and design. And this is the book we are going to talk about today. So Marty is the foremost expert when it comes to brand strategy. And that’s why I really wanted to have him on our podcast today to talk about becoming a bandmaster and almighty, thank you so much for taking the time to join us on our podcast. Okay. So first I want to say to our listeners that the book is, is probably quite different than anything else out there in the sense that the book is, is brief, but, uh, don’t get me wrong. The book is very informative and it’s packed with lots of great tips. And as Marty explains himself, I know you’re a busy, my goal is to get you started right away. So you can read most of my books on a sort of plane, right? So there is no fluff, no filler smarter, just get straight down to the point, which I really like, okay, mark, this, you present in your book, five disciplines. I wanted to make this podcast actionable for our listeners. And talk about a bit about each of those five disciplines. Okay. But we thought we’d do that. I wanted to start with a basic question. What is a brand? Because it might be a trivial question for some, but I think it’s important to just get us on the same page. So whether it is for designers who want to become a strategist or for entrepreneurs interested in brand strategy, so different experts will define what a brand is differently. So what’s your best definition of what is a brand

Marty Neumeier:

I’d like to start with what a brand isn’t, because there’s so many definitions out there and I find most of them unhelpful. So if the goal is to be helpful to today, to, to your listeners, um, I first have to kind of address all the other definitions, which aren’t completely false, but they’re just not very useful. So the F the first one is that a brand is a logo. People often stay, look at the, on that package there, can we make that brand a little bit bigger? Uh, what they mean is the logo or the trademark. Um, and we just have to that’s, that’s the oldest wrong definition, uh, out there. In fact, that’s completely wrong that a brand is a logo or a logo is a brand. We have to just get rid of that. And so what, let’s move on to another one. That’s a little harder to get rid of. Some people say brand, when they mean a product, like what, which brand did you buy? That’s wrong too. You can’t buy a brand. You can buy a product, come back to that one. The other one is that this is a more sophisticated run. A brand is the sum of all impressions, all the impressions we get about a product, a service, or a company, add those all up. And that’s the brand. That’s very appealing to people in the advertising business, for example, because they, they want to sell impressions, right? They get paid by the impression they get a percentage of each impression. So the more impressions they sell the better. So that’s the way they presented the sum of all impressions. So let’s create a lot of impressions, but anybody in the business knows that not all impressions are created equal, right? So some things aren’t impressive at all. They they’re, they’re not even impressions. You don’t even notice them. Other ones are huge. They’re super important. So that’s not a very useful definition. Another one to address is the one that I hear from CEOs and leaders of companies, which is, they say our brand is our promise to our customers. That’s not entirely wrong. A brand does create a sort of implied promise, but typically you’re not telling people, we promise to, you know, fill in the blank. Then we never say that, you know, it’s something that customers take from what you’re doing. They see an implied promise, and that’s good, but it doesn’t help you to think of a brand as a promise, just discount all those. And I think the best way to look at a brand is to think about it as a person’s gut, feeling about a company, product or service. It’s a gut feeling because people are attracted to companies and products, emotionally, as much as we like to think, we make our buying decisions. Logically there is a bit of logic, but mostly we make them because it’s an emotional connection that we feel strongly about or strong enough to make a purchase to gut feeling. And so right there that makes it more difficult right now. And now we’re dealing with gut feelings instead of actual data and, you know, things like that. So it’s a person’s gut feeling, not a company’s gut feeling company’s got feeling is not going to create the brand. It’s what customers think of you. Again, a brand is a person’s gut feeling about a company, product or service. Now what that says to anybody creating brands is it’s not important. What you say the brand is as the company, it’s what customers say. It is. The customer defines what the brand is. And once you know that, then you realize, well, that’s where the work is. The work is in people’s heads. You’ve got to how they think about your product or your service. So, and that’s what has happened. You have to change people’s minds, you have to change their lives. And that means knowing about summers really deeply,

Arek Dvornechuck:

‍Right? So just to sum up for our listeners, our brand is not a logo and it’s not a product or service. It’s just a person’s gut feeling. And each person is going to have a different feeling, right?

Marty Neumeier:

‍Every person has a different brand of you. The goal is to get as many people thinking about it the same way as you can, but you can never get everyone thinking the same way. So do the best you can, but you need to know what people are thinking. And you also need to know which customers bought, not going to get them all, which customers do you want, and which customers can you get based on your offering, because those customers be your customer tribe. And typically they have in common with each other. And that’s why you want to pick carefully. You want a strong tribe because you’re working with them because they’re buying your products. You make them a stronger tribe, stronger people, because the strongest tribe, usually in the long-term, you don’t want to be selling to people who don’t have the money, or aren’t loyal in nature, or are only looking at you as a transaction. You know, those kinds of things don’t make for a good tribe. So you want the best people you can get. You may have to compete with other companies to do that right, to get those people. So that’s where the work is. And so branding is a lot of strategy and it’s also execution. So you can have great strategy and it could on paper look like it’s going to really drive success for the company, but you have to execute that. And that’s where design and creativity comes in. And that’s no easy trick to get really good design that’s on strategy. And that’s going to change people’s minds and win their hearts. That’s the connection we have to make between design and strategy. They have to connect and they haven’t connected for a long time. That’s the movement that’s happening that we’re calling branding is to get those two things together, strategy and customer experience.

Arek Dvornechuck:

‍And that’s the premise of your book, right? So it takes both strategy and creativity. So good strategy and good creativity. Also, you point out in your book that the problem is that the strategists think differently. They are more analytical, logical, linear, or concrete, and designers are more like emotional, intuitive. They think visual, physical, that’s the premise of the book. There is a gap between them and we need to work together as a team to bridge that gap and to build a charismatic brand, right? That’s it. And

Marty Neumeier:

Interestingly, those two ways of coming at the world, one is sort of the logical way. And the other one is more creative way mirror. The way our brains work, the human brain is divided into two halves. And the feeling is that one half is much stronger in the creative side and the other half is stronger on the analytical side. And that’s the way society is broken up too. There’s people that are good at one and not good. The other, most people are better at one than the other. A few people are good at both. They’re strategic and they’re creative. They’re analytical and really imaginative at the same time though. But those people are rare. Maybe one in 10, people are like that. Most people fall to one side or the other because they are really successful doing it. That way. We learned that early on in our lives, which of the two sides are best for us. And we work at, you know, we learned to be better at that. And then for us, the world starts to look like that. To us. We think everything should be creative or everything analytical depending on our orientation to the world. No, we are

Arek Dvornechuck:

Going to take a quick break here, but we’ll be right back. Listen. My mission is to help people build and design iconic brands. So whether you’re a business leader who wants to become more intentional with branding and all of its aspects, or you’re a creative professional who wants to attract powerful clients and surely be able to help them with branding, then you need to start with a discovery session in order to develop a strategy that will inform all your creative work and everything that you need in order to learn how to do that. You can find in my online courses at com slash show, where I share with you, my worksheets, case studies, video tutorials, and all the additional resources to help you feel safe and strong about your process. Now let’s get back to our interview.

Marty Neumeier:

Now in business, a business makes up for analytical people because it ties into math. So well ties into profits and dollars and everything. It’s a natural to get political people into a business. It’s not so natural to get creative people. And that’s the missing element. So when you get people involved in a well-organized business, it produces greatness. I look at apple slightly more on the creative side than on the business side, but pretty well. And so you get these great products that actually work, and you get this tribe of people that are crazy for the company. They just love it. And they were going anywhere else. Okay. So, so that comes from having a charism. That’s a charismatic brand where you get both sides, analytical and creative working together. So yeah, that’s the gap. And I’ve been working for almost 12 years to close that gap and I’m seeing good progress, but you know, this is going to take a long time because we’ve had a century of people discounting native thinking, the left brain, which is the analytical brain acts that bully the other side of the brain. It’s smart enough to be a bully. Whereas creative people tend to not be bullied. They’re open they’re everything. They’re open to experience their brains. Don’t work that way. That’s another reason that creativity has been kind of blocked in a lot of companies, but now it’s quite different in companies are actively looking for creative people. And now we’ve got to create real progress and business.

1. Differentiate

‍Arek Dvornechuck:

Bending is the process of connecting good strategy with good creativity that brings to talking about those five disciplines of branding, right? So starting with discipline, number one, which is differentiate. So here you talk about three basic questions that we need to find compelling us to be in order to build a charismatic brand, right? So those three questions are, who are you? What do you do? And why does it matter? And as you say in your book, and I also have experienced that with my clients, that most companies have trouble us reading them, especially the second and the third one. So why does it matter? That could be a quite problematic question to us where, so can you talk to us a bit about this first discipline and perhaps give us some examples of sort of brands. The three

Marty Neumeier:

Questions are about three different aspects of a business. Who are you? What do you do as a matter, why are you is who are the founders of the group? Why are they doing it? What’s their passion, their passion do this. What’s the vision of this company. You know what, what’s the purpose of this company in a broader context, you know, beyond making money, what are they trying to do? People want to know that? So that’s really important. Second question is pretty easy. It’s what business are you in? In other words, what is the category that you’re selling? Oh, it’s a retail bank. Oh, well, we sell, you know, the software or, you know, whatever it is, you need to know where you’re playing, what you know, name, the playing field that you’re on. So that’s pretty easy. The last question is hard. Why does it matter? That’s really getting at the definition of a brand. Why does it matter to customer? Why should they care? Why should they choose you over a competitor? The answer to that one is usually rooted. Different customers have to see you as different in some important way that does something right, that they want. If you’re the only one, they have no choice, but to come to you and pay whatever you want to charge, if they can afford it, if they see that you’re the only one and they can’t afford it, you know, maybe someday they will, they’ll go someplace else because they can’t afford the best, but they definitely have an idea of what’s the best. And that’s very valuable for a company to be seen as is the best at something. And typically the best isn’t about doing higher quality products or services that doing something different and being seen as the only in that industry for your customers. And then they’ll do anything to have that, to choose that product service over the other ones. So you have to have that. So differentiation is the basis of any good brand without that you’re stuck. You’re not going to go anywhere.

Arek Dvornechuck:

‍Right. Also it’s about specialization here, right? It’s about being super focused and also, right. You should be number one in your car to go to any, if you cannot then, you know, define another category, right? So

Marty Neumeier:

If you’re, if you’re number one or number two, or maybe number three, if you’re number five or number seven in the ranking, in your customer’s mind, the only way you can win is by just suffering. You know, just getting lucky and making a few sales or lowering your price so that you can compete. That’s not a good thing to do. So if you’re lowering your price just to compete, that’s your branding. Uh, you should be different enough where you don’t have to lower your price. So if yourself below lowering your price, been a customer, then go back to where one you’re out, your differentiation be more different in some way, it was finding a niche, finding some space that you can own. It’s important to customers, enough customers to build a business on.

2. Collaborate

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right. Okay. So the second discipline, uh, we’re going to talk about is collaborate, right? So can you talk about how brands are built and why collaboration models and basically the premise of this, the second discipline is that it takes collaboration to build a brand. So it’s just not about executives and marketing people who manage the brand, but also are all sort of, you know, the, uh, specialists like strategy consultants, design, funerals, PR firms, advertising agencies, industrial designers, and so on. Branding requires a team of specialists. They’re sharing ideas and working together towards a common goal. So can you just talk to us a bit about this second discipline? Yeah. So

Marty Neumeier:

Collaboration requires people, right? Like with any, you don’t want everybody to have the same skill. Well, nobody’s going to have all the skills. You don’t want a football team, or every player is a kicker, right? Passers and whatever, or you’re blank. You want variety on your team and you want every player on the team to go really deep into something, to be really expert at something and probably not very expert at other things. So that means you need to collaborate. So, you know, so it’s those two things go together, specialize and collaborate. So you become a specialist and work with other people, uh, in the capacity that, you know, best. If you’re a graphic designer, you want to be the graphic designer on the team, right? If you’re a business consulting firm, you want to be the business consulting firm or that team. So everybody needs to specialize and then they can work together. So a good example is, uh, he would works on a collaborative model. So Hollywood is just a big industry where you have a lot of specialists. You have actors, you have directors, you have set designers, you have sound people. You have, you have artists who work on backgrounds and you, you know, just like hundreds of people, you you’ve sat in a movie and watched all the credits and you go, how can so many people work together on one two-hour movie? I mean, it’s thousands of people. Well, because that’s what it takes. And this is the same with the brand. A big brand takes quite a bit of people somewhere on the inside of the company. Some are on the outside. And so what you do is you build a big team to make that movie. And when the movie is done, large park team, go back to their businesses and they go and do a movie for somebody else. They just, they go back into their, uh, their, their specialties and get another client. So that’s the sensor bill too. So someone has to orchestrate all that too. You know, I mean, that’s a lot of P two. And so you need new ways to do that. You need like brand Bree. You need someone to manage the whole project. You need team managers, you need a lot of coordination. And so if you don’t know how to that, or you’ve never worked on a team successfully, probably not gonna get a chance to, because you know, you have to sort of work your way into this, this knowledge out of work with people. And when you, when people find out you’re a really good collaborator, they’ll want you on their team in the, but it’s not something that’s taught in design school or in business school, how to collaborate. It’s just not. So that’s one of the teaching in our first course or brand or class masterclass one. So that’s the importance of that. No brands are built by one person.

3. Innovate

Arek Dvornechuck:

Okay. So, uh, and the next discipline is innovate. So here we talk about the importance of execution. So if you have good strategy, but poor execution is not going to work, as you mentioned at the beginning. So in this part, you talk about innovation that it requires creativity, which means thinking fresh ways, right? So can you just give us an overview of this third discipline and how you see that? Yeah.

Marty Neumeier:

‍It’s really important not to do what everybody else is doing. And what’s hard about that is most of us, the way we learn is by imitating other people, right? We see somebody do something and then we go, I can do that. And we practice a bit and we get good at it. And we admire people’s skills. And so we want to have those skills too. And that’s great. That’s good for learning, craft, whatever you’re learning. You know, you have to learn by watching other people, but to succeed in a brand situation, you have to go further than that. And then you have to do something that’s never been done before. A lot. You have to do a lot of that. You have to always be thinking in fresh ways. You don’t have to be completely innovative, but you need to be at least fresh. You need to surprise people. Surprises is half the battle. And branding is surprising customers with what you create, what you say, all those kinds of things surprise them in a good way, because if there’s no surprise, they understand that there’s not anything new here. If there’s nothing new, there can’t be anything really valuable that they’ll want to pay for here. If there’s nothing valuable, then you’re a, basically a commodity and you have to lower your price. So, um, being surprising in the right way is really important. So that’s what innovation does for branding. And it can do it at the product level. At the messaging level, at the business model level, innovation is super important. And yet it’s, again, not something that’s taught in school as a subject, and it should be because without it, you’re just not going to build an important company, right? You’re just not, you’re going to be a commoditized company where you’re selling your products on price. You have to do something different, but of course you can be different and not be good, right? There’s a lot of different things that are just bad. And that’s probably why they’re different. There has to be different and good. Those two things have to come together. When you can put those two things together, you’ve got the basis of a very strong offering where you find that kind of thinking is in the creative arena, you don’t find it so much in business schools. You know, business schools teach you to mitigate risk, to play it safe, to protect the company, to keep it running smoothly, like, like piloting a ship between reefs. You gotta be really careful. Don’t wreck the ship. That’s a lot of what, uh, an MBA teaches you to do. Design school teaches you to go right for what customers love and create some experience for them. That’s magic. So that’s way different than what you learn in business school, but you need both to create a very strong brand. So that’s logic plus magic,

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right? And the, also in this part, in the book, just for you guys, really give us principles for coming up with a good brand name. What are the qualities of a good brand name? You talk also about icons, packaging, web designers, so on. So if you guys want to learn more, I invite you to check out the book.

Marty Neumeier:

‍So my background is in design. That’s all I ever wanted to be when I was younger, just as a designer, I started moving into branding because I realized that design is not very powerful on its own. It’s only powerful when it connects with something that matters to businesses and branding is that area where design and business success overlap. So that’s why you want to be in branding and not just design. If you’re a designer, understanding how brands work will make your work so much more powerful and give you access to better projects, because you’re thinking in a way that matters to a business. But that doesn’t mean that all the other stuff you do, isn’t super important. All that craft stuff that you do, all that quality that you put into everything really important. And don’t ever cut back on that. There’s such a need for that, but it’s just, if you want the best projects and the most influence in the world, connect your design work to branding,

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right? So that’s for, for you guys go on to become strategist. And, and I can definitely relate to that because all I wanted to do when I started, when I was 16, I just wanted to design and I love designing. But as you already mentioned, design on its own, it doesn’t give you that much power. You actually need to get to know how business people think and to be able to explain some of your creative choices and work with them. So I really appreciate you and all the content you’re putting out to teach us as designers and open our minds and learn how actually branding works. You know how we should combine strategy with design, right? Not just,

Marty Neumeier:

If you want to be a strategist, you don’t have to be a strategist, have to be a designer who understands strategy. So you know how to contribute to the whole project in a way that really makes a difference. And also it allows you to get better work because you can talk about it, right? If you can talk about strategy and how your work is strategic, oh, it probably will double the value of your work. At least the perceived value with customers. And so that’s what a lot of designers never, they just want to do the work and they don’t understand why they never getting the best projects and other people are getting them that maybe those other people aren’t even very good designers. Well, they’re probably not, not, but they’re probably understanding something that you don’t about how business works, right? So you just don’t want to let them take the stage when you should be on the stage, you should be the one doing it. If you’re the better designer, you need to have those jobs, not those other people who don’t know how to design all they have is some information about business. So just don’t let that happen a lot about this so that you can elbow them offstage,

4. Validate

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right? So you don’t have to be a strategist, but you should be a strategic designer. Okay. So the discipline number four is to validate, right? So we need to violate our ideas and turn our, while the gases into more educated ones. So whether it is about new packaging or a brand name, you talk in this part about validating ideas and getting feedback, right? And there are different ways, you know, quantitative studies research and qualitative research. And I know that the premise of this part is that quantitative studies, they just lead to like analysis paralysis and small improvements, and at least have a lack of courage. And this is something we’ve talked about earlier. So focus groups, they don’t bring best results. And you would actually advise us to do more of qualitative research quick and dirty and one-on-one interviews. And you also present us with different tools, select swap tests, test the concept, test the field test and so on. And so if you could just talk about some of those tools so we can understand the concept.

Marty Neumeier:

Well, I started learning about these because I was asked to way back in the late eighties, when I was doing a huge project for apple redesigning all their software packaging, they had their own software company because in the beginning there weren’t enough diverse apple had to start. They had to get the ball rolling by putting out their own, super into the company. It’s the make or break part of the company. And because I had decided to specialize that word again, right? I differentiated my company, specialized in software packaging for retail. I got the job. And part of it in the process of designing all this, I was asked by the president to test these designs because there was a difference of opinion on which designs were going to work the best, and they really needed these packages to sell. And so I course will have to figure out like, what are all these, oh, you know, what’s possible. And that led to a huge awakening for me to the power of testing, to better design, not to hold back to them, but to lead you into directions that you would never be able to go because you just didn’t have the insights or couldn’t convince the client or the bot to go along with your idea, because it was too bold, right? So bold ideas get shot down in the absence of proof. If you can’t prove your bold ideas going to work, then who’s going to take you up on that. That’d be crazy. So you have to be able to test your prototypes, prove that something is going to work, and then you get permission to do something amazing, but you have to prove it. So how do you do that? I’m just a designer or, you know, what do I know? Well, I found out I didn’t have to be a professional researcher to get this job done, to satisfy even a client as sophisticated as apple. I just had to have something. And so we started just testing packaging in a store in various stores and found out all kinds of things. People didn’t know about packaging software and all kinds of things. People didn’t know about design, even designers because designers never test their work. They just like, oh, I just thought it would be cool. So I did it well. Um, yeah, it can be cool, but you want to know whether it’s going to work or not in the marketplace before you spent and millions of dollars on it or hundreds or whatever, you know, whatever level you’re on. You want to, I don’t know if this is going to work or be a waste of money. So the testing is the answer to that. And focus groups is kind of like the common answer you say, oh, we’re going to test these designs. And people say, oh, focus groups. You know, they love to say focus groups, focus groups are easy to put on. You go to a firm and they got a room. You can stand behind the glass. And the people in the groups can see you and you can listen to all this stuff. And it’s just all a bunch of opinions, right? I mean, it’s its own focus groups were invented to focus research. So it’s a way to find out what’s important about a brand. I’m going to find out what people are thinking. Then we’ll focus our research on that, that thing. It’s not a method of choosing the best design. You know, it’s not, it’s horrible for that. So what you have to do is create situations where customers can see whatever you’re doing in a realistic situation, as realistic as possible. And you have to ask the right questions. One-on-one not in a group for patterns, look for patterns in what they say. And if you do this as the creative person or a strategist, you’re going to go, oh, that’s what happening here. Okay. See how they’re thinking about it. And you’ll learn things that you’ve never would have guessed. And so you get insights from this, and then you go back to the drawing board and you do better work because now you know what people are thinking. And when you do that, your work can be two, three times as powerful as just winging it. The other thing it does, if you have a creative firm or you’re a freelancer or whatever that, you know, you’re running your own business, you can get work based on your ability to test your own work. Like if that’s built into it, it’s like I always test my own work. And that part of the price is that, yes, the price is higher. But when you work with me, you get a proven result. You feel confident about what we’re doing. So it’s not my opinion of what’s best. It’s not your opinion of what’s best. Neither of us has the answer. The answer lives with customers because, you know, they say it is right. It’s not what you say it is. It’s what they say it is. We need to find out how they’re receiving our work before we finalize it. Very simple. And nobody does it, but I’ve been doing this for 30 years and there’s no way I do a significant project without testing various parts of it, because I really do want to be successful.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right. I think that what’s really interesting here is those different tests, right? Like swap tests and test the concept tests and so on. So for example, just for your guys here, listening here is here, for example, one of those tests, right? So we have the, the nationwide and Polaroid and I happened to ward on the rebrand of nationwide. So basically I worked with Jeremiah and Geismar as a designer. So if you can swap the name, any part of the logo. Right. And if it looks, yeah. If it works better for another company, can’t be as

Marty Neumeier:

Good as possible. Isn’t right. Because it’s better just by using somebody else’s symbol. Right. So you know that yours isn’t good. It should be perfect for that company. When you’re doing that, love, it should work for nobody else. Nobody else would be able to use that symbol or that

Arek Dvornechuck:

Name. Exactly. So does the swab test and another, for example, hand test where you basically, if you cover the logo and you can still recognize the brand by messaging, by tone of voice by, you know, all the visuals, that’s a good sign, but if you cannot, that’s a bad sign, right? You don’t

Marty Neumeier:

Want to have to depend on a logo to do all the work. Logos are super important. Probably the most, the logo and the name are the most important touch point of a brand, but they don’t carry all the way. There are elements, important elements, and they have to be right, but you shouldn’t expect them to do it everything. Right. That’s very old school. It’s like, let’s just get a good logo and a good name and be consistent with all the colors. And we’re done branding does that, maybe it was okay back in the fifties, but the definition of a brand has changed. The understanding of a brand has grown quite a bit. So we know that there are many other important touch points also.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Okay. Okay. So let’s talk about the last discipline, which is called Evert. So here you point out that our business is a process is a living. Organism is not an entity. So can you talk about consistency versus inconsistency or imperfection, which I think is really interesting. So can you just talk about this last discipline and what do you mean by consistency versus inconsistency and imperfection? Why we should strive for perfection? Always since

Marty Neumeier:

‍It takes a lot of collaboration to build a brand, you really need to build your whole company around your brand. The company should be built and organized to support that brand. This is where a lot of companies fall down and they haven’t figured that out yet. Like the brand is the most important thing. And we need everybody to work on that brand. I don’t care what department they’re in. Finance included. You have to be very aware of the main asset of a company and for successful companies, that brand is more than half of the value of the company. This is really important, right? So you need to build the whole culture around it. So this is kind of like something that happens between the CEO and human relations, you know, somewhere in there and organization designers have to be in on all this stuff. The other point that you mentioned was that a brand doesn’t have to be perfect. It’s true. I mean, in fact, perfection is boring. Who wants that? What they want to see is a real life thing. They want to see some humanity in a brand. So that means you can make mistakes and maybe it’s okay to make mistakes. But what do you do when you have a mistake? You apologize, you admit your mistake, you apologize for it. And you fix it publicly. That doesn’t make you a weaker culture that makes you a stronger culture. Brewers will love you. If you have a problem or make a mistake and you apologize and fix it, then they start to see that you’re real. You’re relatable. It’s these companies that never admit mistakes. And everything’s perfect. It’s like, who wants to be involved with that? It’s like, it’s like, if you have, if you got a friend who acted like that, you wouldn’t feel very close to that friend. You would just say, this person is very private and impenetrable. I don’t know what they’re thinking. It’s hard for me to relate to this person, consistency, which used to be how you built a brand is you’ve got a logo and some callers and messaging and you always stay on brand. You never change. Right? You just like, you just pound on that thing through advertising and repetition. Well, that doesn’t really make sense anymore. If you’re trying to be a living thing, it’s okay. If your logo isn’t the same every time, or you have different ways of showing up, as long as it doesn’t confuse anybody, as long as they know it’s you, that only helps. Right? I mean, there are companies that change their logo lock have 15 different logos, but they’re all part of the set that they use and kind of a feeling that they have. And people love that. You know, it depends on what kind of company it is. I don’t expect IBM to be changing their logo for every particular use, but I don’t mind it for Nickelodeon. I don’t mind it for MailChimp. You know, they have the Chimp and the Chimp is different every time. It’s just great. It’s just better. Designers can relax about that. The main thing is that you’re creating a character, you’re building a character, building the company into a character and characters have flaws. They do some things well of the things they don’t do. Well, BMW is all about precision and kind of snobby approach to driving. You know, like we’re the best, the most sophisticated, but you don’t see the ultimate driving machine, but you don’t expect BMW to show a lot of empathy, you know, for people and neither do the drivers, right? At least in the U S are they drive faster than everyone? Well, the rules don’t apply to them. They’re arrogant in a sense, but that’s one of the flaws that you put up with, if you want to be that brand that, you know, that’s, that’s that character, the flaws, just make it more interesting. I wouldn’t necessarily try to be perfect. I would try to be something. I would try to be a definable character that everyone can understand and relate to and care about. They have to care about this company, like what happens to, to want the company to win right. For them if the company wins.

5. Cultivate

‍Arek Dvornechuck:

So that’s what it means when you say our brand is a living organism. Okay. So as we are approaching the end of our interview, can you just let us know either for designers who want to learn more from, I know that you organize workshops and seminars. So maybe for designers who want to get certified brand strategists or for entrepreneurs and business owners who want to work with you, how can we get in touch with you?

Marty Neumeier:

Yes. Thing is to go on and buys one or more of my books. They’re easy to read there. They take to read a book and you’ll be reading them probably for years and years, going back to them, that’s the way I have designed them. So that’s the first thing. And for people that already know my books and want to go further, they can get involved in the level C program, levelc.org. And it’s a five tier learning program for people who want to be expert in branding, right? So it’s about brand mastery. You have to work your way up from the bottom to the karate school. We’ll be having other sorts of classes also besides the five main ones. But those are the ones that are going to take you to the level you want to go. And those that are available, I mean, we used to do these only in person like in London and Los Angeles and Philadelphia, places like that. But because of the pandemic, we started doing them online and they’re very popular online. So, um, it’s, it makes it easy for people to attend these things. You know, when the pandemic goes away, we’ll be doing live and we’ll always be doing the online ones too, because it’s a great experience. They like it lasts a week. It’s just two days and you, it tends to be a little evolving. So that’s, I would look at, see, you know, if you’re interested for masterclass one and see what’s where that takes you. So everything we talked about today is in masterclass one. So masterclass one based on The Brand Gap, masterclass two is advanced strategy. And that goes deeper into differentiation. This is for people that strategist at least have a strategy component to their work. And so, but you have to take masterclass one first. Right?

Intro

Arek Dvornechuck:

What’s up branding expert? Arek here at Ebaqdesign and welcome to On Branding Podcast. And today my guest is Sean Adams and Sean is the Chair of Undergraduate and Graduate Graphic Design at Art Center College of Design. And Sean is also on on-screen instructor for LinkedIn Learning. And he’s the only two term AIGA national president in AIGA’s hundred-year history. So in addition to that, in 2014, Sean was awarded the AIGA medal. It is the highest honor in the profession. And previously Sean was a founding partner of AdamsMarioka and worked with clients with big brands like Adobe, GAP, Target, Disney among other big brands. So Sean is also the author of multiple best-selling books, including this one, How Design Makes Us Think. And this is the book we are going to talk about today. Hello, Sean, thanks for taking time to join us on our podcast.

Sean Adams:

Oh, it’s my pleasure. And like I said, this podcast is so amazing. You have such great guests and the content is truly what it’s, it’s one of my favorites.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Yeah. And, um, thank you so much for taking the time you are a great guest actually. So I’m happy that you were able to join us. So I wanted to talk to you about the content of this book. It’s a really great book. You’ll give us a lot of examples to illustrate all of these chapters in the book. So basically the premise of the book is that as designers, we must be more purposeful and aware of the formal choices that we make. Right. Also think like,

Sean Adams:

I think that aim and on the opposite side for people that are civilians to read it and actually understand that the designers are making purposeful choices, that they’re not just arbitrarily saying, oh, I’ll make it red, because I feel funny that day, you know, as designers, we’re logical, you know, smart people. And it’s important for, I think our clients to understand this, we’re not just wacky doodle artists that are toiling away at it in an attic and France.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right. And you talk about that in the book is some of it is intuition, but for the most part, there are some reasons for why we make those choices, right. So, you know, can you dive into those reasons, sociological, psychological historical reasons and asking yourself the question, what visual and conceptual cues resonate with us and why? So, as you said, you know, it could be for creative school, do it more intuitively, and now try to understand perhaps the science behind it, or to be able to articulate better their designs to, to their clients. For example, all just, you know, regular people, as you said to have them understand why we make those choices as designers, right? So basically you divide your book into 13 chapters, right? So what I wanted to do, you know, if time allows, I wanted to spend a couple of minutes just giving out lists and that’s an overview of each. Uh, so starting with the first ones, the action, right? So how do you seduce the viewer? How we can use design to, you know, invite people to become more intimate with our message.

1. Seduction

Sean Adams:

I mean, you know, seduction is it’s, it seemed to me that, that I started with that chapter because it was the entry point to almost anything that, you know, our job as designers is the first thing they have to do is actually get someone’s attention and make them want to get engaged. And there’s ways to do that. And clearly, you know, a lot of those are basic biological reasons that we’re going to respond to brighter colors because they typically meant good things. That’s a good barrier to eat. That’s like a fresh fruit as opposed to, okay, that’s a murky color, perhaps that rotting needs not so tasty. So I think those basic sort of biological reasons that people are attracted things, plus, you know, the reasons intellectually, like why someone might see something and want to want to engage is really critical that, you know, you’re asking the viewer to ask questions, to look at something and say, gee, I don’t under, I need to know more. And that’s sort of what we’re always trying to do as designers. And I have this argument, every one saw with someone and they’ll say, well, I don’t think work has to be attractive. I don’t think it has to be attractive either. But I do think he had asked to reduce the viewer. I think something has to engage the viewer in a way that makes them want to dig deeper.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right so you talked about color, as you said, primary colors and associate them with some positive feelings, right? Like you said, fruits, flowers. And we talk also about forum in this chapter, that there are shapes that, you know, with naturally find attractive and here you talk a lot about, you know, go the proportions golden rectangle and Bonacci sequence and so on. And you’ll give us actually a lot of examples here. So just for our listeners to, you know, we just want it to show us what’s the content of the book too. So there is a lot of examples illustrations.

Sean Adams:

Yeah. I mean, I love that just by her blue ball on, the arrows magazine, which is, um, that was an erotic magazine, right? Like that’s the, you know, and, and it’s amazing that new balance took it and redefined it from sort of the girlymag that was typically out there at the time and used, you know, for the cover of that one bright yellow and a big amount of negative space and, and all of these things that would first get your attention, but then very quickly tell the reader or the viewer, this is not your typical erotic magazine. This is for someone who appreciates good design or understands the negative space. All of those kinds of little cues get thrown in there. So that the, so that if I’m just looking for some like really revolting pornography, that’s not the place to go. You know, that I’m going to know, oh no, I’m going to go there. And there’s going to be probably smart content, something interesting. And LouDelan was a genius to that. This sort of tapping into the, the things that we value in terms of emotional resonance and utilizing those, um, in, in such a great way. I mean, I think it’s fine with arrows too, that we look at it. You can look at it now and it’s so tame. I mean, it’s so like just polite intellectual sort of discussions, but the commentary that they would get back then, like you were going to hell for doing this magazine. It’s just, it’s amazing how times change. Right.

Arek Dvornechuck:

The next one efficiency. So in the next chapter we talk about efficiency. So my question is, so w why efficiency is so important when it comes to design and how we can use it as designers to tower.

2. Efficiency

Sean Adams:

I mean, I think the first thing with efficiency to consider that I had not actually considered until I started working on the book was the fact that efficiency is a modern concept that obviously we’re going to like something that works better than something that doesn’t, I’m going to like a round wheel because of the actually functions as opposed to the square wheel, right. That’s just sort of, you know, a given, but this idea of valuing efficiency as an attribute that we, we should really adhere to, I think is a very 20th century sort of Bauhaus concept that, you know, making something with the least resources to actually succeed is what makes it efficient. But if I have to, you know, if I have to work a lot on this cup to make it be able to drink out of it, I’m not gonna like it. But, you know, we’ve been taught, this is efficient. It has a handle. It doesn’t get too hot. It does all the things that should do, as opposed to say someone in France in the 18th century, they weren’t that concerned about efficiency. They were more concerned about beauty. You know, they’re like, you know, they want that teapot to be like fancy, you know, like a lot of gold stuff all over it. And it’s probably a nightmare claim, but that was that society’s values. And I think it’s interesting that we, you know, in the 20th and 21st centuries really say the least resources necessary to actually achieve the result is what we, we want. Um, it doesn’t mean it’s the right thing. It just means it’s the thing that’s happening right now.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right. So, so in this chapter, we talk about Bauhaus, right? As you said, you know, a day rejected ornamentation and all kinds of unnecessary decoration, right? Focusing on the Fox function and form, and a carrier to also talk about modalities principles like simplicity, geometric perfection form follows function less is more and so on. So I think this is pretty interesting now all of the design that should be familiar with those concepts.

Sean Adams:

Yeah, no, I agree. A hundred percent. I think it’s interesting too, you know, that those principles came out of the wreckage of world war II. You know, that group of artists and designers really looked at world war one and said that what is called caused by the aristocracy. I mean, that was not about, you know, the working man. We just got our hands dirty because there was banking issue sand let’s reject anything that has to do with, you know, this sort of aristocracy or what is seen as corruption and focused purely on these universal forms that in theory, everyone could relate to and deal with discard envy. And it would discard any kind of sense of, of, um, social hierarchy. Obviously that doesn’t work. You know, we’re individuals, I recall like going to the Bauhauson a tour and, and the dorms there are identical, right? Like every room was this exactly the same, every button of the same bed, the same little nightstand, the same desk. And then you see pictures of what the students did to it. And everyone was totally unique, which must’ve driven, the professors mad, like you’re supposed to keep it all the same. It’s not supposed to be individual, but I really liked that idea that they tried, they tried to use design to make a better world. It was one of the first instances of we can create a utopian society if we follow these values. Right.

Arek Dvornechuck:

So that would be about efficiency. So in the next chapter, maybe we can talk about the concept of love here you talk about some brands, aspire to inject love in their message. Right. And an example would be McDonald’s McDonald’s tagline. I’m loving It. The logo, I love New York, right. Which was designed to promote the New York city. So can you talk to us about what are some of the ways to communicate the concept of love in a piece of design?

3. Love

Sean Adams:

I it’s such a great question. Do you have good questions. Um, the issue of Luvois such a complicated chapter to work on. And I actually, at one point thought about discarding it because it was like a whole other book. I was like, this is really getting me in deep trouble because there were different kinds of love.Right? There’s a Roddick love. They’re essential love. There’s fraternal love. There’s all these different facets of love as a concept. And what I found really exciting, and it really wasn’t like a light bulb went off in my head was the fact that as designers, we are somehow able to convey the complexity of that emotion, the contradictions that exist within that state are difficult. Right. Like, okay, I love, you know, I love my mother, but she dragging me. How do you know there’s a, there’s all these issues, you know, involved with something like that. One of my favorite examples I think, was Marian banshee’s, um, Valentine’s cards that are so amazing at their ability to pull in all of these different aspects of travel and romance and PR expectations. And, and, but at the same time as the overlay of the contradictions and the complexities of love, that was extremely exciting. And, and then the fact that, you know, historically we, we looked at erotic love in such constrained ways that really point to, I think some instance, some things we need to think about a society today that, you know, like typically erotic love was defined for the other. Like, it was fine if it was like Aphrodite, right. It was fine if it was some natives in Tahiti, but it wasn’t okay if it was like your next door neighbor, you know? And, and the fact that we would describe these difficult feelings society to the other is something that’s really interesting. And, and, and once I, once I saw that, I really started seeing in contemporary times how that happens, how those, how those really complex difficult issues can somehow be sort of pushed off onto, well, it’s not us, so, but it’s okay with them. But that happened a lot to do with 11. I like Milton’s I love New York. It’s, it’s so simple. So beautiful. Um, you know, so to the point, but like the idea of love it embodied so much complexity, right? I love New York, but good. God, the garbage is awful. I love New York, but the weather is terrible. It’s so hard to live here, you know, all that kind of stuff. Um, it’s inherent in that identity or, you know, McDonald’s, I’m loving it, which is actually kind of a subliminal way of saying don’t feel guilty about going to McDonald’s at not cooking for your family. It’s okay. Cause you love it. Like there’s these sort of messages that I found that, you know, designers, we just started to embed in there without even thinking,

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right. Yeah. Yeah. I’m loving it this long on yeah. It’s brilliant. And I love this expression as well. Okay.

Sean Adams:

Isn’t it gorgeous that Alexander Gerard. Yeah. It’s just, I find that

Arek Dvornechuck:

Highlighted here kochanie it’s in Polish actually.

Sean Adams:

Yeah, Exactly. That’s what I mean, someone like, you know, when you’ve worked with amazing designers, you know, and someone like Gerard who who’s like, you know, thinking globally and integrating like all of these different aspects and then creating something so elegant and beautiful it’s, it’s something designers are so, so good at right.

Arek Dvornechuck:

There are lots of examples, but I wanted to talk since we have 13 chapters to talk about.

Sean Adams:

Yeah. So sorry about that to start with. So I did cut them down. Okay.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Let’s talk about humor. Now we talked about love a little bit. Why humor is an extraordinary tool for designers? Why do you think so?

4. Humor

Sean Adams:

Humor is such a great Trojan force. It is such a great way to get through the door without someone recognizing that you’re actually bearing gifts. They may not want, um, I love the fact that I can talk about a difficult issue. That’s a controversial issue by embedding it in something that’s sort of funny, you know, because by funny you accept it as like, oh, that’s that’s okay. And yeah, like the Neo, Neo, um, posters in there, you know, um, for a festival in Geneva and, you know, they look sweet and funny and soft and humorous, but in fact, they’re talking about voyeurism and selfies and do DIY graph Evans, all these other issues and get it in there or, or on God scenes. Um, I love graphic design poster, which has really corny, you know, like cats with laser eyes and, and, um, it’s, it’s, I love that. I love that thing. I have it on my wall. It’s so great. You know, and the corny gradation sand comic Sans, it does all these evil things you’re not supposed to do. So it’s an in joke for designers like, oh, isn’t that funny? I’m doing all these bad things, but in reality, it’s talking about a new language of means. And in fact that means is actually a language that’s sort of in constant crazy evolution. If I did a poster about that, I’d like to have be boring as hell. Right. But by doing, dragging in the humor, I’m in there already, it’s just such a great way to disarm someone. And then, then they’re like, oh my God, I didn’t even think about that. Now I’m stuck, you know?

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right. So, uh, some of my key takeaways from this chapter, I, as a design that we can get away with more, if the message or experience is humorous, right, as you said, this is going to make it more approachable, especially when we talk about some boring industry or boring messages or something like that, we can make it more appealing to the audience. So, you know, uh, when it comes to coladas, as you say, in this section, bright colors and hoppy symbols that use you are, is going to evoke, you know, uh, positive feelings and some humor in our designs. Right?

Sean Adams:

Yeah. And I mean, I think that the idea of adding the bright colors and, you know, that was another, that’s another sort of interesting aspect of humor that there’s a naughty factor to humor. Um, you know, that’s sort of the typical basis of a joke is that it’s somehow has to lead to the unexpected. Um, I use the example of the Henny young, the joke, which is, um, while playing golf today, I stepped on, I hit two good balls. I stepped on a rake. Right. So you’re forced to imagine someone playing golf, then you’re forced to imagine him or her hitting two good balls and then the rake. And then it’s like, oh my God, that’s not what I expected. And it’s naughty. And I feel sort of like, oh, I got it now. Right. So there’s that sort of release in their attention. Um, and that’s the thing where humor works. Well, it always has that little edge of I’m a little bad. Like there’s a little, you know, um, in here and it’s, it starts off all nice and sweet, but there’s always something that gets thrown in there. And the end that you don’t expect. I like the fact, like I love the example I actually, that I actually referred to in there with star wars, which is that humor is relegated to the PIRO. Can never be funny. Like the hero has to be serious. The hero Luke Skywalker is serious. Like he’s like serious hero dude. Han solo is a little naughty. He can be funny, you know? So that little levity sort of opens that door to, like, you can say things are a little off color or a little like, oh, I didn’t expect that. It’s, it’s a great tool for designers, you know, sort of work around, um, with some difficult issues.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Great example in packaging, for example, this one, which you guys can see, they use vegetables to describe the size of a condom, right. As you can see here, it looks like

Sean Adams:

It just looks like such a what a lovely packaging for something. And then, oh my God, it’s condom packaging and what am I holding? And I liked it. I love the fact that the experience of that, which is critically, you know, the issue that designer found on that was that girth is more problematic than length because of, you know, functional issues. And so getting the right girth is really critical for autonome to work. So in order to figure that out, you’re going to actually have to like, hold something and be like, yeah, that’s about right. I mean, I really think that, you know, what a great experience for someone to have to be like, oh my God, now I realize what I’m holding, you know? Yeah.

Arek Dvornechuck:

I’m not sure if you guys realize, so yeah. They reference vegetables. Right. So you can guys see, so,

Sean Adams:

Um, yeah.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Okay. So maybe let’s talk about one or two more. Um, we have a few minutes, so the next chapter is about intelligence. So how do designers convey intelligence in, in their design, how to communicate, uh, you know, intellectual aptitude.

Sean Adams:

I mean, when you turn that back on, you’d be like, which example in there would you respond to the most that in the intelligence chapter?

Arek Dvornechuck:

Either the first one.

5. Intelligence

Sean Adams:

Yeah. I mean, I love that one. That’s okay. It’s, it’s such a great one. This, idea that, so obviously many of our clients, like, I don’t think we, any of us have clients either whether we work in-house or we work, you know, um, you know, as at an agency, no, client’s going to come to me and say, can I appear stupid? Like, everybody’s basically like list of attributes intelligent, right? How do I convey intelligence? Well, of course in today’s world, we’re going to describe intelligence with really simple things like basic geometry, simple forms, technical looking stuff, you know, things that have to do more with the scientific and the rational, as opposed to the emotional and that, you know, the, the ability to take very simple forms and very sort of minimal tool sand allow them, the viewer to have to do some of that work is what says I’m intelligent. That’s the thing, you know, like my iPhone, like I could be like, yeah, this is an intelligent object, right? It’s it looks intelligent if I have, you know, some big fancy to doodle thing, then it’s probably not right. You know? And so I’m like, well, this is clearly, this tells me I’m intelligent. Well, who knows, maybe the thing barely works, you know, but I’m still going to scribe to it. Oh, that’s intelligent. Or your microphone. It’s like, it’s gorgeously designed. It’s black. It’s telling me I am a serious object. I am serious here. And I work well and I’m intelligent, right? Like this is for someone who knows what they’re doing. Um, as opposed to, if you went and bought the Barbie microphone, which probably would be thinking sort of big and bold to see. Right. Yeah.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Yeah. We can definitely, we can imagine that. So you have some other examples here, as you were talking about scientific kind of look and feel like

Sean Adams:

More so gorgeous. I mean, you know, and I mean, I won’t go into, that’s a deep story, but it’s such a complex story about the musician that the work is about and the ability to replicate it in this form. But the audience was the kind of where the kind of people that responded to intelligent work that they’re like, I’m going to, I want to listen to that as opposed to Justin Bieber, you know, that’s very clearly aligned with that, that I, that tells me all by that record, that that’s for me.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right. So we’ve talked about intelligence and in this chapter, you talk about the elegance, you know, and how we can use foreman and aesthetics in general, you know, when it comes to, for example, using [inaudible] typeface, right. Classical type faces or a certain call orders that would convey that, you know, prestige that value. Uh, so how do you design something that will be perceived as elegant?

6. Elegance

Sean Adams:

The core of Elegance in the end that, that, that it really boiled down to was proportion. I just found that, that, you know, there’s different, different areas, different cultures have different values in terms of like, I, I think this is beautiful and wonderful, but everything that you would say that’s an elegant design is based on really beautiful proportions. And whether that proportion is the golden rectangle that people are utilizing or adding, using an example of a George Nelson, um, um, chaise lounge in there, which is a series of golden rectangles. It’s, it’s built on a beautiful grid. Well, the normal, consumer’s never going to notice that, but it’s going to feel ready. Right. You know, and it’s sort of like, it goes to the heart and when somebody tells me, oh, I hate grits. I’m like, are you out of your mind? You hate grids. That’s the basis of like good proportion. That’s what makes things elegant is, is the ability to work with consistent values that build something, you know, the human mind, we live to put things together, right? Like we just sort of are working hard, wired to try to make sense of the world. So if I look at a box of disparate objects, I’m immediately going to start to figure out, well, I’ll move all the orange ones here. I’ll move all the blue ones. You know, that’s what we do by organizing something with beautiful graded structures. It just feels right. There’s not so much discord. Like it’s already come together in away that I, as a, as a human being be like, oh, that feels right. You don’t like my book case. It’s like, you know, basically like squares, I don’t have to work that hard at it. It’s like, oh, I got it. Right. It’s all where it should be. I can accept this now. So it’s that, it’s that, it’s just that core idea of like work with beautiful proportions and maintain those proportions. And you’ll end up with something that is elegant, um, which I really found, like you can go back to like, you know, Roman statuary and move your way up and anything that we consider. Well, that’s why you’re incredibly beautiful and elegant. There’s some remarkable proportions built in there.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right, so some of examples here.

Sean Adams:

Oh yeah. Like the Ava’s ice soul, um, pottery, just, I mean, beautiful. Right. I mean, so it is exactly the same shapes over and over again. You’re there, you know, wonderfully

Arek Dvornechuck:

Those scores. Yeah. They are beautiful. And the photography itself, you know, of those objects and also like a page layout right here where we yeah. The grids and the proportions. Right.

Sean Adams:

And some of that I really realized, like when I would talk to some of my clients and they’d say, oh, can you move this here? And be like, no, it’s not on the grid. And they’re like, what are you talking about? And so I really feltlike maybe I need to put in something, there is a grid, like for, if you’re a civilian and you’re working with a designer, you say, oh, I see why they’re doing what they’re doing now. This isn’t just, they’re just putting things like randomly,

Arek Dvornechuck:

I definitely can relate. And I think most of the designers can relate to that, that, you know, we, as designers, we know, we know that all, we instinctively align things to grades, to certain elements, like on a page, for example, some layout of a page, right. That is like invisible lines. And, uh, clients don’t realize, you know, they have some requests that would break that the grade because they don’t because they don’t like, they, they, they don’t understand that. Right. But once you show them kind of an option, you know, version B, they, when they look at it and compare, uh, how, okay.

Sean Adams:

And now I understand that it doesn’t key. All right. Something’s wrong. Yeah.

Outro

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right. Um, okay. awesome, Sean, so as we are approaching the end of our interview, I just wanted to ask you, you know, how we can find more about you, whether, you know, I’m not sure if you still work with clients, but creatives who want to learn more from you. What’s your website, social media.

Sean Adams:

Um, you can reach me at, um, my website, which is, um, seanadams.design. Um, there’s also, um, an online publication that I’ve been doing for 10 years now, which is, um, burningsettlerscabin.com And I think my Twitter feed is SeanAAdams. So, um, you can track me down there and, um, yeah, there’s always new books rolling around. I think I’m working on writing one right now for the Smithsonian. So there’s always something kind of fun around the corner when I’m not actually forced to just be dealing with administrative issues.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Right. Yeah. So I’m going to include those links in the description box. So you guys can check it out. And of course, I’m going to link to the book in the description as well. So you guys can, you know, learn more about all those principles, all those concepts that Sean is talking about, we just gave you an overview of some of them, but there is much more information and interesting things in the book. So yeah.

Sean Adams:

I think I’ll have them like the second version. Revenge Of How Design Makes Us Think, because I honestly, I had to adjust in 12 chapters cause they were just, it was like, yeah, you’ve got 224 pages. You cannot have 35 chapters, but yeah.

Arek Dvornechuck:

We should expect the second edition. So

Sean Adams:

Revenge of that’ll be the next one

Arek Dvornechuck:

Okay. Awesome. Thank you for your time, I really appreciate that.

Sean Adams:

My pleasure, thank you for such great questions.

Arek Dvornechuck:

Thank you.

When design solutions create problems: a new logo for sustainability,"Is this not to be celebrated? More and more attention being drawn to sustainable options? Why might I suggest this could be more problem than solution?

Each of these logos requires recognition, cognition, and — crucially — trust. Some companies and certifications are incredibly rigorous, others are plain greenwashing, and the onus is on the consumer to decide which is which. Like I’ve done previously, I compare this to price and quality ratings. Price has one face — a numerical cost. Ratings are almost universally 5 stars. All products play by the same rules, and they are instantly understandable. With the proliferation of sustainability logos, are we solving the original problem? Are we helping make it easier for people to buy better? Or are our well intended individual efforts having a collective effect of making consumers have to work harder? Companies attempting to stand out from one another in sustainability may actually be undermining the bigger cause that has been set out to be achieved.

I believe indicating sustainable products is one place where the design process can and should diverge from the typical design dogma of solving for your own company or cause’s brief. Instead, could companies collaborate, perhaps with the governments too, to try to reach commonality rather than disparity? Fewer, more meaningful, logos, or ratings. Directly competing companies using the same means to judge and indicate sustainability. With a reduced surface area, the pressure increases. The road to get there is fraught, however. These conversations between companies rarely happen, and certainly not commonly between designers who are ultimately the creators of these assets. The certifications are all in competition with each other, each vying to be the truest and most recognised. Could there be a mechanism for designers across companies to create unified thinking, in recognition of sustainability’s greater purpose? How would it happen? It’s the ultimate design brief.",https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/when-design-solutions-create-problems-a-new-logo-for-sustainability-226f349912cb,['Rich Brown'],2022-01-06 12:11:26.929000+00:00,"['UX Design', 'Design', 'Logo Design', 'Sustainability', 'UX']"
How does SatoshiDAO work?,"Basically, SatoshiDAO is a decentralized reserve currency protocol on Ethereum backed by bitcoin assets. Inspired by the spirit of Bitcoin to allow people to collaborate in a decentralized network, SathoshiDAO aims to give Web3 citizens the opportunity to earn higher yields with Bitcoin through an ERC20 token called $SATO.

Each $SATO is backed by but not pegged to 0.0001 BTC-pegged tokens in the treasury. This maintains the value of a $SATO because it can’t fall below the underlying BTC, then the protocol will Mint or Burn tokens directly in response to the price, which has the effect of constantly maintaining a price above the backed assets. To make it simple, take WBTC as an example, when the value of $SATO is below 0.0001 WBTC, the protocol will directly buy and burn the token. If the value of a $SATO is above 0.0001 WBTC the protocol will mint and sell new $SATO.

To accomplish the goal of making people earn more with their Bitcoin, as well as ensure the long-term sustainability of our system, SatoshiDAO employs two main strategies, namely: staking (to better reward stakeholders), and bonding (to efficiently drive liquidity).

Now let’s dive into a detailed interpretation that may help you obtain a clearer understanding of how SatoshiDAO works.

Staking

Staking is how SatoshiDAO distributes the profits of the protocol equitably to participants with a rebasing mechanism. It is designed as the dominant strategy for people to participate in SatoshiDAO. The best thing to do for most users will likely be to just stake, hold, and compound.

In practice, you will stake and lock your $SATO for a certain period of time and receive an equivalent reward in $sSATO at the ratio of 1:1. Your $SATO balance rebases up automatically at the end of a given period.

How does the rebase happen? SatoshiDAO distributes tokens by sending them to the staking contract without asking for $sSATO back. This increases the ratio of $SATO staked to $sSATO outstanding, and results in a rebase to correct the difference.

Note that $sSATO is the protocol’s profit accruing token. Stakers will earn 100% of protocol profits (minus the DAO’s cut). When you unstake, you will burn your $sSATO and receive the equivalent $SATO token at a 1:1 ratio. Unstaking means you quit the distribution process of the protocol’s profits.

The logic behind Staking is to set the staking rewards to exceed the potential loss caused by market volatility over time, so that the incentive structure effectively removes all reason for any staker to sell his/her staked $SATO. This delicate incentive structure is inspired by the game theory, which is the main power to drive the growth, ensure high APY, and keep stability, leading to a further positive feedback loop.

In SatoshiDAO, we want to build a consensus that the more $SATO tokens a participant stakes, the more bitcoins in the market he locks up, and the more rewards he will receive through staking.

Bonding

Bonding is a process that allows you to buy $SATO at a lower cost basis. In return for giving up your LP shares, the protocol will sell you $SATO at a discount, which will be dynamically adjusted according to the protocol’s risk-free value.

Bonding is designed to replace the traditional liquidity mining scheme with the protocol-owned liquidity method. Projects no longer need to sacrifice ownership in exchange for temporary liquidity.

The end result of this design is that SatoshiDAO itself becomes its own market maker, and is able to provide sustainable liquidity for $SATO regardless of the returns, thus ultimately reducing the volatility of the $SATO price.

Furthermore, these LP tokens can constantly generate revenue for the protocol, as they receive the majority of the market maker commissions from the swaps made on DEXes. The benefits, in this case, are win-win, which means the sellers of LP tokens can receive a discount relative to the market price to purchase $SATO, and SatoshiDAO can acquire liquidity and assets for its treasury, further increasing the net asset value of each $SATO’s underlying assets.

And for users, after creating a bond (or shall we say buying a bond), they can continue to enter into the same incentive structure as any other $SATO stakers to boost their benefits.

And More

SatoshiDAO will continue to be expanded on, most importantly by the introduction of other BTC-pegged tokens, which will eventually form the backbone of the whole ecosystem.

Coatue and Tiger Global Betting on Braintrust and a Web3 Revolution in IT and Operations Optimization,"This December, Braintrust announced a $100 million private token sale to an investment group led by Coatue with participation from Tiger Global, True Ventures, Hashkey, Blockchange Ventures. The infusion of funds is specifically meant “to grow the network and fuel rapid community-led innovation.” This indicates that this investment is less about what Braintrust does, match employers with talent, than how it does it, through community ownership and web3 protocols. In so many ways, this investment is about the future of digital transformation and how corporations will, or in this case will not, manage it.

The Disappointing Good Intentions of Digital Transformation

The digitalize or die wave that has gripped IT and Operations for a decade has only intensified over the last few years as dramatic commercial shifts strain bottom lines and remote work becomes the norm. In 2022, IT budgets are expected to eclipse those of the past 2 years and soar to 2018 levels and beyond.

The majority of this new spend will be on Web 2.0 projects that will fail. A 2020 Boston Consulting Group study concluded that an astonishing 70% of digital transformation projects fall short of their goals even when the organization is fully on board. Companies will fully commit to digital transformation this coming year and, sadly, they most likely won’t actually transform the organization in any significant way, leaving users underwhelmed and the IT team hobbled by an already outdated infrastructure. This failure will cost corporations nearly $111 billion.

Braintrust and the Web3 Approach

Braintrust is a web3-powered 2-sided marketplace currently focused on connecting high-end freelance tech and design talent with top employers. It’s main innovations, however, don’t surround its approach to recruiting, but its approach to operationalizing a business.

Instead of bloating an IT department with full-time personnel and expensive consulting firms, it uses grants and bounties to incentivize its freelancing tech-centric customer base to create value within the platform. The Braintrust platform’s initial use case of high-tech talent matching and job bidding is ideal because it attracts the exact people to the marketplace that Braintrust needs to help build out its core platform. In turn, talent is able to boost their value through increased technical experience in an emerging area, web3, further differentiating their talent supply.

Furthermore, The protocols that govern token ownership, voting, adjudication and eventually features like staking (enabling talent and employers to stake tokens to insure delivery on both sides) resolve user research deficiencies (because the users themselves are shaping the new functionality) and reduce bloat in other departments like legal and finance. Not coincidentally, Braintrust plans to expand its services to these other disciplines in the future, further enabling the ecosystem to successfully shape the organization.

The above information comes from Braintrust’s real-time Network Dashboard where community members can openly track Braintrust’s growth.

The $100 million token investment led by Coatue and Tiger Global, among other things, is an investment in the promise of web3 tech to change the IT and Operations cost structure of 2-sided marketplaces, optimizing the IT and operations spend and making them much more profitable, even as both sides get better deals. Braintrust openly targets what it calls “outdated, fragmented recruiting systems” by incentivizing community members to contribute technology, educational services and social marketing. This reduces friction on all sides, making connections between supply and demand quicker and cheaper to execute. Buying $100m in BTRST specifically “to grow the network and fuel rapid community-led innovation,” will act as a catalyst for this virtuous cycle.

Flipping the UpWork Model

To see how this might work long-term, let’s compare Braintrust’s model to that of UpWork, one of its web 2.0 competitors. UpWork generates revenues from membership and transaction fees charged to both talent and employers, with talent shouldering most of the cost.

Braintrust doesn’t charge talent for its services, instead choosing to take 10% of the contract value from the employer.

Because of this approach, the employer pays more in the Braintrust model, but the overall marketplace share (what UpWork calls the “take rate”) of the transaction is less.

Braintrust’s single-sided fees ecosystem is actually more economically efficient and obviously more attractive to top-tier talent. But will the employers pay more? Braintrust is betting that the employer will because it will want to be where the top-tier talent is. This may have them paying more in service fees, but also getting more for their money. One could also envision overall hiring costs dropping due to less friction in the end-to-end process, creating better employer terms as a result of this efficiency. At a cost of anywhere between $3000 and $4000 to hire a single employee, streamlining the hiring process and gaining access to adequately vetted candidates can lead to sizable reductions in the overall cost of recruiting and impactful increases in net productivity.

Expected Challenges Remain

Braintrust has some challenges. It’s talent pool appears web3 curious but more often than not doesn’t understand web3 itself or it’s role in the recruiting world. The talent is often simply there for globally accessible well-priced contracts with good companies. That in and of itself isn’t bad, but it does necessitate continued education concerning the value of the platform, and it means that the current talent pool isn’t likely to be enough to implement the required changes to the protocol. Fortunately, however, its community-based contribution model is designed specifically to address these shortcomings through education and ambassador grants.

Braintrust and the New Way Forward

Today, corporations are spending large sums on digital transformation largely driven and resourced in house. This is costly and often disorienting as the core business suffers under the distraction of technological pressures. The Braintrust web3 approach provides a solution to this model, creating potential for a win-win between corporations that must update their technological core to survive and the increasingly-empowered high-end talent needed to make such updates possible.",https://blog.cryptostars.is/coatue-and-tiger-global-betting-on-braintrust-and-a-web3-revolution-in-it-and-operations-f7666ad60f8a,['Charlie Heinemann'],2022-01-13 20:59:51.291000+00:00,"['Web3', 'Token Sale', 'Technology', 'Information Technology', 'Recruiting Technology']"
🔮 The 10 Best Web3 Design Inspiration Sites,"As former CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey recently tweeted “You don’t own web3 but venture capitalists do” and Marc Andreessen blocked him after the Web3 comments, it is opening up discussions in the community about whether Web3 is really decentralized. However, it is undeniable that Web3 really brings fresh changes in terms of both technologies and design trends — which is really interesting to learn for UX/UI practitioners like me. Below I present to you an awesome list of Web3 companies and hopefully give you inspirations for designing effective messaging on the web platform.

01 Cosmos

Before Cosmos, blockchains were siloed and unable to communicate with each other. Cosmos aims to solve this by decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains that can scale, interoperate with each other, and handle large amounts of transactions.

02 Axies Infinity

Axie is a popular blockchain game in which players buy pet NFTs (Axies), breed them, battle with them, and trade them. It has successfully blazed the play-to-earn path, because rather than selling game items or copies, the developers of Axies focus on growing the player-to-player economy and take small fees to monetize.

03 After Party

Founded by creators, for creators, Afterparty is committed to providing the most powerful Web3 tools that help creators build and maintain meaningful relationships with their fan and supporter communities, including an NFT marketplace through which creators can offer NFT collections. Afterparty’s platform also gives creators the ability to host intimate, live experiences for their most dedicated fans and create exclusive NFT tokens.

04 DeSo Foundation

The DeSo blockchain is supported by the non-profit DeSo Foundation, whose broad mission is to support the decentralization of social media.

05 Foundation App

Foundation is a creative playground for artists, curators and collectors to experience the new creative economy. Creative community can showcase their work to collectors and anyone who wanted to support creators’ work.

06 Llama

For Bounty Hunters, they can collectively join forces to form their own Services DAOs–think of these as organizations that provide outsourced help to DAOs that don’t have the required skills on hand. Llama is such a platform that allows Bounty Hunters to “Contribute-to-earn” using their functional knowledge in treasury management.

07 Snapshot

Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results.

08 Juicebox

With Juicebox, projects are built and maintained by motivated punks getting paid transparently, and funded by a community of users and patrons who are rewarded as the projects they support to succeed. Juicebox believes that the future will be led by creators, and owned by communities.

09 Alchemy

‘AWS for blockchain’ Alchemy wants to do for blockchain and Web3 what AWS (Amazon Web Services) did for the internet. ​​The startup’s goal is to be the starting place for developers considering building a product on top of a blockchain or mainstream blockchain applications. It has reached profitability and raised $250M from a16z leading the financing.

10 RabbitHole

Currently, blockchain technologies are opaque to average consumers, especially on financial transactions. However, to make decentralized identity useful and widespread, it is important to map off-chain experiences and affiliations on-chain, such as people’s educational accomplishments, professional achievements, or fanships. RabbitHole allows users to record professional achievements on-chain.

Welcome to Elacity, the Elastos Marketplace and surrounding ecosystem project. Our goal is to bring smart contracts and aggregated services to Elastos to help power a new economy using Web3 technology. Elacity was first drawn up in 2018 as a digital asset marketplace, UI mockups were made and teased to the community in 2020, and this year, with Elastos technology maturing and support, we began the process of building out the vision.

Elacity wouldn’t be possible if not for the hard work from our development team, from Elastos Orchard, and our community where donations have come through Elastos’ co-founder Feng Han and members via NFT Art and Gold token offerings. Thank you all for your support and encouragement.

Over the past few months, we have built and achieved an Opensea V1 marketplace for Elastos, enabling users to;

Mint Elastos Smartchain NFTs,

Create and browse each other's shops,

Make offers directly to each other,

List assets for a fixed price,

Put on auction for a set amount of time.

As a result, we have brought new contracts and features to Elastos including building the first NFT environment for desktop users which can help lower barriers to external adoption. To celebrate this milestone, we will officially launch Elacity and our limited edition 500 total Bella Series Collection on the 24th of January.

Shortly, we will additionally introduce NFT collections and an ELA to WELA converter, enabling a better user experience and giving creatives a place where they can launch and mint large amounts of NFTs onto our marketplace. We will explore aggregating external ESC NFTs on Elacity and accepting ERC20 tokens such as USDC and Elastos GOLD.

With ESC fees currently less than 1cent, we encourage artists to reach out to our team today should you want to have one of the first Elacity collections prior to launch. We are excited to have already worked with external artists to bring limited-edition off-brand and experimental NFTs to purchase via the Elacity Auction House in 2022. We welcome all forms of creativity and will enjoy promoting artwork and collections on Elacity as we grow.

The Bella Series

Bella is the mascot of Elacity, and this NFT funding round marks our first ever limited edition series where a total of 500 Bellas will be made available to purchase with the official launch of Elacity.

Today, we are pleased to announce that we have teamed up with Profile to become one of the first spaces on its platform, with a goal of building an Elacity think tank and forming a small tightly-knit knowledge hub to support and counsel on important growth decisions. Each Bella NFT will grant you access to the Bella space on Profile.

Whilst the Bella Series are there to make you smile and be enjoyed as original Elacity issued art, it is our wish that as Elacity and users on Elastos grows, so will the desire to acquire a scarce Bella NFT, and Elacity will strive to continue giving privileges and finding utility wherever possible for Elacity supporters and Bella holders.

We welcome artists, engineers, enthusiasts, and business developers to collect a Bella NFT and come connect and have a voice in how we build out the Elacity vision.

Web3 Conference

With the Web3 Conference kicking off on 26–7th of Jan 2022, Elacity is happy to announce it will be supplying the free NFT’s advertised to each ticket holder that attends. This is an exciting step towards onboarding new users to connect, collect and join Elacity and the Elastos Smart Chain environment. We will create a collection for this giveaway in the coming weeks. Suggestions or collaborations are welcome! We will additionally work with our partners to further promote NFT utility and create opportunities for platforms using Elastos technology.

One of the first success stories of Elacity in 2021 has been Elastos GOLD. GOLD was independently created in early 2020 on the Elastos Smartchain where with the launch of Glide Finance this year it’s total supply was made available via a fair launched liquidity contract for the community.

With a total supply of only 1000 GOLD, no inflation, and starting at around 5c per GOLD (with high price impact), GOLD’s price rose to an all-time high of $820 per GOLD, teasing towards a $1million marketcap! As redistribution has taken place, the price has since settled at around $300 per GOLD and we are excited to see its status continue to grow alongside Elastos as a popular ESC collectible whilst we work to bring utility via Elacity.

Long-term Elastos member Vegas Mike helped create the tokens art and the community has donated over 105 GOLD, empowering us to set up the Elacity GOLD vault found here. This will be governed by our City Council DAO with a goal to grow our supply, to lock GOLD and ELA liquidity and bring a healthy trading environment and rising price floor.

As part of The Bella Series, all ELA raised from Golden Bellas will be paired with GOLD and locked into our liquidity vault.

Gold art and donations have been made by the community. We would like to thank the following community members; Pahini, FoxFortyTwo, Uthuk, Bunny Punk, Jeff Way, Vegas Mike, Austrader, Roboznt, Anon 1, Anon 2, Chrono, Nenchy, Mad Max, and Shaq. Thankyou all who have supported GOLDs growth in other ways too, this is grassroots, fun, and really feels like a community token already.

Elacity Map

Welcome to Elacity! This is our home. We have delivered the Elacity map V1, including districts and areas which are inspired by many long-term builders.

We believe the Metaverse will play a huge part in the future with the advancements of VR and AR technologies, we have set a vision for the future where we can build a virtual city under the Elacity name, trade land parcels, and move into an immersive experience. This is a north star, where a simple 2D view of our map today can help remind and inspire. You can zoom in and view the map in 8k here.

Elacity moving into 2022

Today Elacity is focused on building out its marketplace and underlying infrastructure. With all the initial fundamentals in place, we will bring DID and verifiable credentials next and revamp our Passport Office. Our goal is to innovate and create a traffic light system where users can add credentials to their Shops, and with it levels of decentralized third-party verification to build trust with buyers. Such options could include Twitter or Discord log-in DID verification all the way to a fully (real) Passport KYC’d identity credential.

We are excited to announce and talk about our plans to build the Cyber Republic Passport. This will represent the highest level of credential available and will be made available on Elacity in Q1 of 2022. We believe 2022 is the year of DIDs and verifiable credentials, and Elacity will offer tools to buy and trade DID names and reputation before moving into our next phase.

Thankyou everyone for all your support today, we are extremely excited to continue building and growing the Elacity platform and raise Elastos awareness and bring new services.

Please remember Elacity is subject to all the risks of any startup and must continue to raise and bring funding to grow and survive. Today, we are still grassroots and reliant on crowdfunding methods and donations to keep developing. If you believe in our vision and what we are doing, think about ways in which you can help us succeed and grow, from promoting the vision, onboarding creatives, purchasing our NFTs, or making donations.

2022 is the year for Elastos, we have many elements all coming together to be excited about and we wish everyone the best as we move into it. We wish you a great new year and a happy holiday. Keep up the hard work everyone! Onwards. Upwards. Elastos!",https://medium.com/@elacity2822/elacity-moving-into-2022-104d713fdec1,[],2022-01-01 13:30:31.511000+00:00,"['Web3', 'Blockchain']"
Why Does Web3 Matter? (Part 3 of 7),"Value Proposition of Web 3

Here, we’ll dive into the three core value propositions of Web3 which are interoperability, low barriers to entry, and decentralization.

Interoperability

If you wanted to switch from Spotify to Apple Music or vice versa, it would be a pain because you would have to remake all of your playlists, listening history, liked songs, and more. Data within applications is centralized and siloed, built with the purpose of locking users in. The lack of interoperability between the Web 2 music streaming services makes it annoying and difficult for a consumer to switch.

We’re excited about Web 3 applications because they are much more interoperable, meaning that as a user you can switch between different applications with ease. This is driven by the decentralized nature of storing, exchanging, and programming property rights for things like currencies, assets, and identity.

However, if you wanted to switch from Uniswap (a decentralized Web 3 exchange — DEX), then you could do so easily since Web 3 services are interoperable. You could switch to Amber, Sushiswap, Bottle Pay, or any other Web 3 DEX and have all of your information transferred over with ease. This is because everything is tied to your wallet address. Think of it as an email but with an associated public transaction trail and all of your assets plugged in. Gone are the days of going through a KYC/AML process and a lengthy fintech app onboarding flow. All you need to do is simply plug in your wallet address and you’re good to go!

Low Barriers to Entry

Developers have a much lower barrier to entry when creating a Web 3 application because data is being shared at the protocol level.

“Protocols are basic sets of rules that allow data to be shared between computers. For cryptocurrencies, they establish the structure of the blockchain — the distributed database that allows digital money to be securely exchanged on the internet” — Coinbase (Source)

Some of the most common protocols used today are in financial and trading use cases. Think of things like asset derivatives, yields, and lending. You’ve probably heard of something called DeFi (decentralized finance) before, and most of the protocols in this space enable that to happen.

Since protocols are open and transparent, any new developer will have access to the same information. This is in stark contrast to Web 2 where the large tech companies have siloed data with much higher barriers to entry. Since all data is being aggregated and kept in silos at the application layer for Web 2, barriers to entry are higher for new product creation in the long run.

Further, developers are also able to self-finance projects by leveraging future speculation of the success or failure of the project. Developers can supercharge the innovation cycle by creating a project token, bypassing the need for traditional venture capital or debt financing. We’ve even seen DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) raise capital to finance projects and innovations in this space. The pace of development in this industry is performing at an unprecedented pace due to some originally Web 2-focused tools expanding into Web 3 like Vercel (frontend development).

Decentralization

Since Web 3 uses blockchain, data and computing power is not centralized like it is in Web 2. This means that there is no central point of failure and that there could be anywhere from 10 to 10 million individual computers validating transactions, storing data, or providing computing power to back the applications happening on Web 3.

Further, there is no central decision making party for Web 3 applications (most of the time), which means changes to the rules of an application are voted upon with governance tokens allowing for community based decision making — rather than a centralized authority changing the rules. We explore why this is so important in our previous blog post here.

(Fat Protocols by Joel @ USV)

The left diagram showcases Web 2 — a small protocol layer with a fat application layer where large companies aggregate and store data in silos to stifle competition. The right diagram shows how Web 3 will create lower barriers to entry for developers. The protocol layer is much larger and the application layer is smaller — this means that the data is aggregated in an open and transparent way for all developers at the protocol layer.

Will Web 3 phase out popular Web 2 applications?

Traditionally, it has been very hard for decentralized networks to gain momentum because it would be difficult to incentivize thousands of strangers to maintain and build out a shared ecosystem. This is because Web 3 companies have been typically operating without a central authority to control decisions, capture data, and earn profits. There have been some comparisons on Web 3 development and DAOs to democratic governments moving slower than others. We’re still in the early days to add in a lot of infrastructure and governance tooling, but this is definitely a risk to mass adoption in the short term.

However, token economics and protocols have changed that and have been the main driver in allowing decentralized networks to coordinate, pool together resources, build, and maintain a shared ecosystem. Token economics and protocols enable decentralized networks to work because, despite no centralized authority, it creates an economic incentive for users and developers to grow an ecosystem.",https://medium.com/rippleventures/why-does-web3-matter-part-3-of-7-7fc2d841f949,['Ripple Ventures'],2022-01-21 12:56:55.059000+00:00,"['Venture Capital', 'Web3', 'Crypto', 'Startup']"
Solidity — transfer vs send vs call function,"In Solidity, there are three ways in which one can send ether. Namely transfer(), send() and call(). In this article, let us discuss how each function call works and which is the best one to use.

transfer vs send vs call

transfer -> the receiving smart contract should have a fallback function defined or else the transfer call will throw an error. There is a gas limit of 2300 gas, which is enough to complete the transfer operation. It is hardcoded to prevent reentrancy attacks.

transfer() function

2. send -> It works in a similar way as to transfer call and has a gas limit of 2300 gas as well. It returns the status as a boolean.

send() function

3. call ->It is the recommended way of sending ETH to a smart contract. The empty argument triggers the fallback function of the receiving address.

(bool sent,memory data) = _to.call{value: msg.value}("""");

using call, one can also trigger other functions defined in the contract and send a fixed amount of gas to execute the function. The transaction status is sent as a boolean and the return value is sent in the data variable.

(bool sent, bytes memory data) = _to.call{gas :10000, value: msg.value}(""func_signature(uint256 args)"");

call() function

Hope this article helped in understating the transfer, send and call functions.

"CGV Research: an Insight into Top 3 Projects in the Web3 Index Chart: Pocket, AR, and LPT","By Vargason, CryptogramVenture FoF Research Fellow

Before the rise of blockchain, Web3.0 can only stay in the concept stage due to the lack of solutions. With the development of blockchain technology, a number of Web3.0 related projects have emerged.

According to the Web3 Index compiled by web3index.org (a website that tracks protocol usage across the entire Web3 stack), in the past 30 days, the revenue and other comprehensive indexes of Pocket Network, Arweave, and Livepeer ranked among the top relative to other projects. Pocket Network is currently the Number 1 middleware, with its 30-day revenue more than 30 times that of Arweave. In November, the fees paid by developers increased by 208%.

In the Web1.0 era, the transmission of information was one-way, without interaction on the user’s side. Web2.0 gave users the right to edit, use, and interact with information. However, privacy protection remained an issue, and the value of user participation wasn’t explored. Web3.0 broke large intermediary platforms’ monopoly that had resulted from Web2.0, transforming the platform-centered value distribution mode into one that allows each participant who creates value for the platform to have a share of the profit.

Web3.0 cannot be built in the air. Before Web3.0 applications can be adopted on a large scale, the blockchain infrastructure must be improved. In this article, CryptogramVenture FoF (hereafter CGV FoF) focuses on three blockchain projects, namely, Pocket Network, Arweave, and Livepeer, and introduces the important infrastructural components of Web3.0 from three aspects: API, storage, and streaming media.

Note: This article is a CGV FoF research paper and is for reference only. It does not constitute any investment proposal.

Pocket Network

1. Basic Introduction

Pocket is a distributed API infrastructural project built for Web3 applications. It provides a trustless API protocol that is available for all major blockchain networks.

Pocket project aims to build a complete distributed network of blockchain nodes. Through the trustless API protocol, developers can seamlessly access thousands of nodes, building a DAO ecosystem in combination with cryptoeconomic incentives.

2. Pain Points Solved

On November 11, 2020, Ethereum suffered an outage that lasted nearly four and a half hours. Infura, the API service provider of Ethereum and IPFS, said that its Ethereum Mainnet API service was temporarily interrupted, which resulted in this outage incidents. This is also one of the many Single Points of Failure (SPFs) perplexing centralized service providers.

CGV FoF has learnt that this incident did not affect users who added Pocket RPC’s Ethereum nodes to their wallets. They could still trade and interact through DApps or smart contracts. This was possible mainly due to the fact that the Pocket Network node operator has a variety of Ethereum clients, which makes the network service more flexible.

Michael O’Rourke, CEO and co-founder of Pocket Network, believes that centralized infrastructure providers must have a large number of available buffers to meet additional needs. Due to the decentralized design of Pocket Network, it only needs to start and run a small part of the backup buffer, thus reducing the service cost. According to the company’s estimates, the Pocket Network services are “at least 10 times cheaper” than centralized services.

3. Token-based Economic Model

Pocket Network has designed a unique economic model based on its token POKT. The model, which is based on DAO, creates a decentralized and trustless bilateral market between nodes and developers in its ecology, which enables all participants to benefit from it. In the Pocket ecology, developers and nodes are the rigid demanders of POKT.

Developer: Uses POKT tokens to implement API requests, thus obtaining more efficient but less expensive distributed API request services.

Node: Possesses a certain amount of POKT tokens to provide node services, and is awarded with POKT tokens for providing API services and implementing developers’ API requests.

Because each party of the market has its own unique incentive mechanism, the bidding prices of both sides also vary. The total supply will be limited by the burning mechanism established by DAO that controls the token policy. The ultimate total supply of POKT will be determined by DAO.

How does POKT become a cheaper solution? The answer is to stake POKT instead of paying AWS bills. As the number of relays and nodes increases, data will become cheaper. It is expected that the price of each relay will eventually stabilize at a certain order of magnitude in the next few years.

Although the network is still in its infancy, the number of nodes keeps increasing at a significant rate.

This new form of payment by staking may become a source of potential friction in the process of adoption. However, once POKT succeeds, we may have found an effective way to connect various Web3 middleware infrastructures with tokens.

4. Partners

Algorand has announced its initiative to enhance interoperability by integrating the decentralized API infrastructure Pocket Network, and is slated to develop cross-chain bridges.

Some cutting-edge blockchain projects have also participated in the pocket ecology, such as SOLANA, Matic, iCon, etc. Technical teams such as BlockSwap Network, Api3, Web3API, Fuse, and SKALE have also adopted POKT. see the figure above.

5. Team Members

Information publicly available shows that Pocket Network currently has more than 20 full-time professionals around the world. As the co-founder & CEO, Michael P O’Rourke took the lead in creating Pocket Network in April 2017. He also set up Nonce+1 Labs, a blockchain development company, and has served as CEO ever since.

The Pocket Network has a strong technical team. Core personnel includes senior blockchain engineers, APP engineers, full-stack software engineers, Big Data architects, cross-chain technology experts, financial technology talents, cryptography experts, etc. The consultant team has a balanced configuration, covering business, technology, operating, market and other fields.

Arweave

1. Basic Information

Arweave is a decentralized network focusing on permanent storage of data. It aims to build a data storage platform that features one-time payment, permanent storage, free reading, and tamper-proof.

Arweave is one of the preferred storage methods for NFT/Web3 projects. As a decentralized storage network based on Blockweave technology, it adopts the innovative Proof of Access consensus mechanism to adjust the amount of data stored by nodes, thus ensuring balanced data distribution.

2. Pain Points Solved

Web3.0 is committed to breaking the monopoly and control of data by centralized platforms. From this point of view, Web3.0 projects will not store data on centralized servers. Therefore, Web3.0 projects will have massive data storage requirements, rendering distributed storage an important infrastructure. Compared with the traditional centralized storage, distributed storage has the advantages of high security, privacy protection, and prevention of single points of failure.

Arweave has changed the data structure of traditional blockchains. Not every node needs to store all blocks, but each time a new block is recognized, it needs to verify a previous random block. This mechanism is called Blockweave. Combined with the Blockshadow mechanism that allows nodes to reconstruct a complete blockchain according to the blockshadow and their own transaction files, Arweave is able to speed up consensus and provide TPS.

3. Token-based Economic Model

Arweave’s token is called AR. The total number of 66 million AR tokens are mainly distributed as follows: 31.4% for financing, 13% for the team, 7.1% for strategic cooperation, 2.9% for consultant, 19.1% for ecological construction, and the remaining 26.5% is reserved. The part for ecological construction is mainly to reward storage suppliers and encourage storage suppliers to process orders, actively provide storage services for users, and effectively maintain network nodes. A total of 11 million block award tokens are available.

In the intrinsic incentive mechanism of Arweave, users mainly consume AR tokens to purchase storage services and store data, whereas storage suppliers obtain revenue by obtaining block rewards and providing storage services.

At present, the tokens obtained by providing storage services account for only a small part of the revenue of storage suppliers. Arweave has created a new consensus mechanism, Proof of Access (POA), which requires storage suppliers to verify historical blocks before getting rewards. The more blocks a storage supplier has saved, the more likely it is for the storage supplier to obtain block rewards.

4. Partners

In the Arweave ecology, the most active tracks are finance, social networks, content distribution, verification, storage and archiving, DAO, and infrastructural tools. At present, the ecology is still in the early stage of construction. The following figure shows Arweave’s ecosystem.

5. Team and Investor

The Arweave team is composed of senior blockchain engineers. Dr. Sam Williams, founder & CEO of Arweave, is a decentralization enthusiast with rich experience in distributed system design and implementation. Sam Williams is an Englishman and currently has 15K followers on Twitter.

Investment institutions are very interested in the storage track. Arweave has raised funds from well-known investors, including top investment and financing institutions such as a16z, Multicoin Capital, Union Square Ventures, and Coinbase Ventures.

Livepeer

1. Basic Information

Livepeer (LPT) is a decentralized and highly scalable protocol at the streaming media layer. Content creators share real-time live videos and receive tokens (LPT) as rewards through video transcoding. Livepeer can function as real-time media layer in the Web3 stack.

Transcoding is the process of reformatting the original video file to ensure the best viewing experience. Anyone can participate in Livepeer and become an orchestrator by running software that allows them to contribute their computer resources (CPU, GPU, and bandwidth) in service of transcoding and distributing video for paying broadcasters and developers. Such orchestrators earn fees in the form of a cryptocurrency like ETH or a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.

2. Pain Points Solved

Live video streaming consumes more than 80% of the Internet bandwidth. For start-ups and developers, using traditional video infrastructure to build a new live streaming platform means high costs. For streaming media applications, one of the most important cost contributors is video transcoding. Take Alicloud as an example, the average transcoding cost of an HD live video streaming is as high as US$6.2 per hour.

Livepeer’s open Web3 video infrastructure provides a creator economy platform for live streaming applications. The platform supports the advertising support mode of traditional technology platforms and promotes a more economically feasible ecosystem than those delivered by centralized live streaming service providers.

3. Token-based Economic Model

LPT is a native functional token of Livepeer. Users can contribute their computing resources to the network through a proprietary “transcoder”. Livepeer network will assign tasks to the user’s GPU. After transcoding is completed, users will be rewarded with LPT tokens.

At the same time, ordinary users can obtain income by staking their LPT tokens (thus becoming a delegator), and the staked tokens can vote for an orchestrator. At the beginning of each round of consensus, the network will select a group of orchestrators who get the most votes for task execution, and the orchestrators will get a corresponding number of new tokens. If an orchestrator is found guilty, the staked tokens voted for the orchestrator will be deducted.

Delegators who vote their tokens to an orchestrator can get a part of the earning from the orchestrator as commission. Therefore, the delegator needs to find a reliable orchestrator to vote in order to avoid penalties, and the orchestrator also needs to establish a good reputation to ensure the support of the delegator in the future.

According to the data CGV FoF finds on Livepeer’s official website, the total number of active nodes has exceeded 100, the total fees earned are around US$322,000, and the total minutes of transcoded video are 8..4 million. The capacity on Livepeer’s network represents access to 70,000+ GPUs, or enough to encode all the realtime video streaming through Twitch, Facebook, and Youtube combined.

4. Team Members

Livepeer lists 22 team members on the official website. As a project that made its “debut” in 2017, its main team members have rich experience in blockchain and successful entrepreneurship, as well as strong technical background. CEO Doug Petkanics graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor’s degree in CS, and CTO Eric Tang graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a bachelor’s degree in CS. The two co-founded the Wildcard mobile publishing platform.

In terms of financing, the project has prominent performance and has been invested by many well-known investment institutions. At present, Grayscale Investment Trust, Coinbase Ventures, PanteraCapital, Digital Currency Group, CoinFund, Animal Ventures and other institutions have invested in Livepeer.

Summary

Web3.0 has been established as the next direction of human innovation. Now we are standing at the forefront of Web 3.0, feeling the impact of the digital world and the physical world.

Pocket Network has entered a huge and extremely dynamic emerging market. It has become an indispensable solution for Web3.0 infrastructure by providing trustless API protocol and relay network infrastructure. If it succeeds, the costs of building applications will be greatly reduced.

Storage has always been the key investment field of all parties, and the importance of decentralized storage will become more and more prominent. With the increasing importance attached to data security and user data ownership, the future performance of data storage networks such as Arweave in the vast and promising terrain of 3.0 is worth looking forward to.

If the video infrastructure solution provided by Livepeer is comparable to the centralized alternative in terms of quality and costs less, it will promote the development of the ecosystem, which is more economically feasible than the centralized live streaming services.

With the development and maturity of Web3 market, decentralized infrastructure will continue to grow and become more valuable, which will fundamentally change the relationship and interaction mode between users and the Internet.

A Dark Forest New Year’s Community Round: Death of the Universe,"Art by komosotweets.

Welcome back to Dark Forest!

dfdao and friends present: ☠️ Death of the Universe 🪐, a community round which will begin on Saturday, January 1, 2022, at about 12 pm PST. The round will end on Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 11:59 pm PST. Gameplay will occur at game.dfdao.xyz.

The round theme and name were decided via community vote, which was the first ever use of Dark Forest points for a governance decision. 17% of the v0.6.4 scorers participated!

This article contains information on the round objective, changes to game mechanics, player eligibility, and whitelisting instructions. Information about how to make sure you’re eligible to play is in the final section.

Objective

In this round, the universe is dying: the radius is shrinking and planets can be destroyed by other players.

To simulate the chaotic nature of the Death of the Universe, for the first time ever, there will be 3 separate scoring functions:

Finding artifacts and extracting silver from spacetime rips (similar to v0.6.2 and v0.6.4). Owning a broadcasted, not destroyed planet lvl 3+ based on proximity to the center of the universe (similar to v0.6.3).

3. Destroying the most planets, weighted by rarity (boom).

For each scoring function, the top 7 players will be rewarded with dfdao POAPs. However, only one of these leaderboards will be awarded prize NFTs.

The decision about which scoring function receives NFTs will be decided in-game: whoever owns the level 9 space-time rip located at (0,0) by the end of the game will have the ability to choose the winning scoring function. This final vote will only be possible once the round has ended.

Changelog

Gameplay:

The ruleset is the same as v0.6.3, except for the following changes:

The speed will be 5x the base speed.

Planets can be broadcasted every 30 minutes.

The universe will start at an initial radius of 400k and shrink to a radius of 80k.

Scoring

Artifact and silver scoring is unchanged from v0.6.2

Proximity to the center of the universe is simply the radius of a planet.

Destroying a planet is worth 4^planet level points.

Destroying planets

A planet can be destroyed if:

It is owned by another player; The energy arriving at the planet is twice the amount of energy the planet has when the attack arrives.

This has the same effect as the Black Domain artifact.

Check out a demo here.

Shrinking Universe

The area of the universe will shrink at a near-linear rate via this algorithm.

Moves cannot be to or from a planet that is outside the radius.

Note: This required modifying the move zk-SNARK, which previously only prevented moves to planets outside the radius, not from.

Players can only spawn in a location that has a radius between 75% and 50% of the current radius.

This will provide a measure of equality in spawning while still giving people a chance to explore towards the center and away from the center.

Features

Players will be warned with a purple highlight if their move will destroy an enemy planet at that planet’s current energy level.

The leaderboards will be retrieved via subgraph queries.

Finally, no whitelist keys will be sent by e-mail for this round. Instead, eligible players will have their wallet addresses directly whitelisted into the game. For more details on this, read the next two sections of this article.

Players who are whitelisted will automatically receive $0.15 xDai to start the game, courtesy of POKT Network.

Who is Eligible to Play?

As promised, any player who scored at least 1 point in v0.6 Round 4 of Dark Forest will automatically have the burner wallet address they used in v0.6 Round 4 whitelisted into the game. You can simply visit game.dfdao.xyz, add your address, and the game will load.

New players and players who have lost their burner wallet addresses from v0.6 Round 4 can join the dfdao Discord to request up to 3addresses for entry into the game.

Whitelist Keys for New Players

If you are a first-time Dark Forest Player, if you did not play in v0.6 Round 4, or if you lost track of your burner wallet address from the round, you can request access to the Death of the Universe by taking the following steps:

Join our Discord server. Visit the #join-whitelist channel. Type the command “-join” followed by up to three addresses you would like to be able to play the game.

Once you’ve done this, a discord bot built by Velorum will add your addresses to a .csv file that we use to enable access to the game.

We will run the whitelisting process just before we launch the community round, and then periodically once or twice a day until the round is over. To maximize playtime, please submit your request to our server before the round starts!

Please note that the amount of addresses that we approve to play depends on the volume of requests we receive. We can accommodate a lot of players, but if we end up getting inundated with requests, we will revert to making a random selection of players to whitelist from the request list.

See you in the Dark Forest.",https://medium.com/dfdao/a-dark-forest-new-years-community-round-death-of-the-universe-785af7c2b56e,[],2022-01-01 21:40:47.399000+00:00,"['Web3', 'Xdai', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Blockchain', 'Dark Forest']"
Web 3.0 and Dapps: How are they going to impact today’s Businesses,"There is no better invention to have come out of the Industrial Revolution than the Internet. Pioneering scientists, computer engineers, and talented programmers have created the Internet as a worldwide information center, altered communications, and now functions as an everyday hangout place because of their amazing achievements. No one person can be credited for making it possible.

It was Nikola Tesla, on the other hand, who first floated the notion of a “global wireless system” back in the early 1900s. Also in the 1970s, Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf created control “transmission protocol” and “Internet protocol” that provided communication frameworks for arranging data interaction and networking.

For those who have witnessed the evolution of the Internet over the past three decades, this is a sentimental occasion. The Internet has gone a long way, and it’s just going to keep getting better and better.

Web 1.0, which served as a directory of information, is well-known to many of us. Data has become more dynamic and available on a wide range of devices thanks to the progression of the web from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and now to Web 3.0. Web 3.0, on the other hand, is a quite vague term.

What changes have occurred in the online ecosystem throughout the years?

When it comes to creating a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly database, the web has gone through numerous stages. Let’s take a detailed look at how Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 have changed over time.

The first version of the Internet, known as “Web 1.0 (1989–2005)

The first version of the Internet became widely used.

static web pages

Information is hard to come by.

There is very minimal interaction between the user and the system.

Insufficiently developed algorithms.

There are fewer ways to connect.

The Next-Generation Internet Web 2.0 (2005-present)

Adaptive web design.

Scripting languages like Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Python, and so on.

a time when everyone has a social media account of some kind.

Interactive platforms may be built using this technology.

Connectivity, resource sharing, and data backups have all been much improved because of these changes.

Apps for cell phones were developed using new tools and technologies.

The Web 3.0 (Present — Upcoming Future)

Websites that assist Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Machine Learning, and the Blockchain.

The confluence of human wisdom and cutting-edge technological innovation

Systems based on decentralization that disperse power equally and do away with hierarchies.

Ingenious gadgets that bring more of the Internet to light.

Without the involvement of a third party, smart contracts operate.

The semantic web is being used to advance the Internet of Things.

Making the web more interesting through the use of cutting-edge visuals, 3D, animation, and virtual applications.

Increasing the personalization, customization, and privacy of the Internet for end users.

What is a Decentralized Web App?

The dApps that would make the web open and transparent are the decentralized web app (Web 3.0 Blockchain app). Ending the monopoly of the IT behemoths, these applications will deliver the power of data back to the end-users thanks to blockchain technology.

What New Business Models Will Web 3.0 Bring?

To a large extent, Web 3.0 is being propelled forward by the decentralization offered by Blockchain. As soon as Web 3.0 is fully implemented, the organizations that rely on user data to run will cease to exist, and the ones that have been working in the background will emerge to the fore In an era where everything from banking to data is open and accessible, businesses will have to find new methods to conduct their business.

To us, Web 3.0 is best for small enterprises as big giants will have to undergo substantial rebranding in order to remain relevant in a rapidly changing marketplace.

What is semantic web technology?

To define and link data on the web in a way that only machines can process, semantic technology uses languages to describe extensive, self-describing associations between data points.

Machines will soon be able to comprehend people virtually flawlessly if this technology is included in the Web’s architecture. When people engage with the web, they will always be able to find what they’re searching for.

Advantages of Web 3.0 for your Business

Pro-privacy and anti-monopoly models

Pro-privacy and anti-monopoly models will be on the table with Web 3.0 characteristics. It won’t encourage the usage of centralized systems that maintain control of users’ data in their own hands.

Decentralization and privacy will be at the core of a shift. Because people may now choose how their data is shown, the monopoly of computer firms will be broken and data privacy breaches will drop to near-zero levels.

Permissionless Blockchain

A central authority will be unnecessary in a blockchain-powered by Web 3.0.. By generating an address, anyone may join the network and take part in it. As a result, users will no longer be excluded because of their gender, income, sexual orientation, geographic location, or any other social aspect.

Transferring digital assets and money across borders will be faster and cheaper thanks to this technology.

Exceptionally Safe

The Web 3.0 is going to be much safer than the previous versions of the Web. It will be very hard for hackers to break into the network without being identified, thanks to the dispersed and decentralized architecture of the system.

Ownership of data

Until now, internet giants have controlled and exploited user-generated data. End users will have full control over their data with Web 3.0 powered by blockchain. Data that is sent across the network will be completely protected.

When companies and advertising organizations see the information that users have shared, they will be able to make money from it.

Interoperability

Data from numerous apps might be accessed using Web 3.0 capabilities, which would eliminate the requirement for a specialized platform. In other words, you won’t have to worry about Web 3.0 just working on certain devices.

What Is the Importance of Web 3.0 for Your Business?

Web 3.0’s impact on business will be to make it more open and user-centered. Revolutionary changes will be made to all aspects of the way corporations handle user data.

How will businesses employ web 3.0 technologies?, enterprises will open the gates for Blockchain and the possibilities it brings with it. Businesses, both old and new, will do this. When your applications get a Blockchain upgrade, you’ll see that everything will be available to everyone.

Service of Changing Money

Centralization doesn’t work when it comes to exchanging currencies. The Mt Gox attack, in which $460 million in bitcoins were stolen, is a prime illustration of what may go wrong. Decentralized exchange is the answer to the problem of exchanges being a breeding ground for hackers. Decentralized exchanges will be increasingly popular in Web 3.0 because they offer a flawless trading experience for users without worrying about hackers or a lack of transparency.

Benefits of Web 3.0 in Currency Exchange

Transactions that are both cost and time effective

a challenge to hack

Compatible with hardware wallets without a hitch.

Full control over the user’s money

Social Media

We can’t imagine our lives without social media. It has the potential to change the way we communicate, connect with one other, and establish communities. With one or the other agenda, platforms have been restricted and limited.

Web 3.0 fundamentally alters the way in which social media applications are created by app development firms. The platforms lose control of data and users regain control, making it hard to spin stories and impossible to misuse data, as was the case with the Cambridge Analytics Scandal at Facebook.

Benefits of Web 3.0 for Social Media

Inability to collect and use data due to lack of centralized authority

Achieves user empowerment through asset rewards

Make sure users’ privacy isn’t violated

As a result, mimicry is rendered impractical

Platforms for Messaging

We’ve always relied on messaging to keep in touch with one another. Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp have dominated our personal lives for as long as we can remember, but Slack and Telegram have taken their place on the business front.

It is true that there are fewer complaints about the contemporary messaging systems, but users continue to suffer from two difficulties — unsafe message transmission and the platform’s vulnerability to hacking.

Apps like ySign, Obsidian, and e-Chat that run on the Blockchain to protect users’ privacy and security are the answer to these problems.

Web 3.0 Messaging Apps Have Many Advantages

Absolute secrecy and non-disclosure of any personal information

Securing and expediting the transfer of assets

Speedy transactions

Browser

Web 2.0 is now dominated by Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, two of the most popular web browsers in existence. However, a decentralized network is required for a web as philosophical as Web 3.0. The future generation of web browsers should be able to save users’ data without leaking it or exploiting it to develop their businesses.

Users’ data should be protected by encryption in Web 3.0 browsers, while also allowing them to be compensated for voluntarily disclosing their personal information.

Why You Should Switch to a Web 3.0 Browser

The internet may be accessed secretly by users.

There are just a few security holes.

Users can profit from the sale of their personal data in a secure and timely manner.

Storage of Data

Data is often stored on Google Drive or iCloud by the average user. Companies, on the other hand, have a very different set of requirements since they want a centralized data storage solution that is considerably more resilient and scalable.

In the current market, most data storage providers are centralized, which means that the data may be modified or sold for advertising purposes, and this is a problem. An issue that has previously been addressed by companies like Uber, LinkedIn, and T-Mobile.

Web 3.0’s decentralized storage facility is the answer to this problem. A peer-to-peer network is used to distribute the encrypted files and data, so they are not kept in one location but on numerous nodes.

For Web 3.0 Data Storage, there are several advantages

It’s compatible with a wide range of blockchain applications and systems.

Strong encryption is used to safeguard the transmission of sensitive data.

There is no central authority.

IoT and other cutting-edge technologies are easily integrated into the system.

Online video streaming

In today’s world, streaming is unquestionably one of the fastest-growing industries of all time. Brands like Netflix and Spotify have become household names in the entertainment sector as a result of the industry’s success.

Despite the fact that the streaming industry is one of the most successful, there are still complaints that user data is being misused for commercial gain and that creators are not receiving a fair portion of the profits.

These vexing problems of Web 3.0 are addressed by the decentralization and smart contract capabilities of the blockchain.

Streaming Services using the Web 3.0 platform have advantages.

Transparency in the work of content makers is possible.

Smart contracts mean no copyright concerns.

Absence of illogical rules for online content producers and broadcasters.

Insurance

For a long time, the insurance and banking industries have been criticized for their reputations as profit-making enterprises. They’ve been working to improve their public image by implementing Blockchain’s decentralized and open nature.

Web 3.0 will be able to process insurance claims and weed out fraudulent ones thanks to current technological advancements. When this happens, we will finally be able to experience Open Banking as a reality for the first time.

Using Web 3.0 Insurance Advantages

Fewer to no scams have occurred.

Increased satisfaction of the buying public

Cross-border payments without hassle

Confidentiality in the bank’s internal audits.

Transition to the Third-Generation Web

As a result of Web 3.0, the way we engage with the digital world will be fundamentally altered, and this shift will affect everyone. Web 3.0 will have a significant impact on all types of enterprises, including established ones as well as new ones.

It’s unlikely that we’ll make the leap from Web 2.0 to 3.0 in a single day. Business owners will be able to reflect on their operations and determine where they stand in relation to decentralization and transparency. However, even if Web 3.0 is still in the future, organizations must begin planning for it today. Help is at hand from our team of Blockchain professionals.

How To Lose Belly Fat Fast & Cure Diabetes! | A Info Buddy,"How to Lose Belly Fat Fast

Hi, I’m going to give you the best reasons why it’s so hard to lose belly fat. Important knowledge is Lisa’s diabetes, which is why we’re alerting this canal, But this direction is not just about diabetes, with talk about weight loss, metabolism, etc. So, let’s delve into why this is so hard to lose, I am belly fat, belly solid is actually a hormonal gland.

Yes, you heard that right, It’s actually the overweight cadres in our torsos, extremely belly overweight, the visceral flab, that we call this and it’s rune fatten. The parts that come out of your belly, Visceral fat, actually act as a hormonal gland. They exude a lot of enzymes, cytokines, and proteins, which actually originate from insulin deficiency.

They are actually protecting themselves, especially in that area, where you do everything you can, but that requires belly fat. You develop that fatty. Well, you will go. But I will tell you, this solid is very difficult to remove because it protects itself from a lot of cytokines.

So the best way to avoid this problem or the best way to prevent it is to not gain belly overweight. We’Ll be talking about that in a second, But I’ll tell you about my belly. Fat is a hormonal gland that protects itself.

Well, we all adored desserts and alcohol right, So social gatherings, you are familiar with, parties, you are familiar with birthdays And on daylights of every kind of anniversaries, we are always subject.

You know, making this difficult decision is the decision to eat and not to eat, to booze and not to suck. It’s a tough decision all around us. So every time you say, oh it’s for once it won’t hurt me it’ll hurt yourself, And that bit of booze and any sweeteners any carbs becomes straight to your belly. Your belly fat will accept that gently and won’t let it go.

low-spirited estrogen positions lead to belly: overweight So it’s no wonder my department is full of women trying to menopause to understand why they are gaining load, even though they haven’t changed anything in “people’s lives”, and I don’t denounce them because when estrogen heights lower, regrettably, your mas switches the force out of your buttocks And? Out of your mas towards your belly.

The Best Workout Exercises For Weight Loss At Home,"In this article, we’d like to provide four exercises that, when done correctly, will help you lose weight and get rid of a sagging and bulging abdomen wtihout gym equipment.

Each person choose whether to workout at home or in a gym. Both solutions have advantages and disadvantages.

If you signed up for group training at a sports club, you must attend to the gym, pay for a membership, and stick to the schedule. It does, however, include all of the required equipment and simulations for efficient weight reduction.

Home exercises have recently become highly popular. You don’t need to go anywhere; just keep to your plan and schedule. To complete the exercises correctly, though, you must have a strong determination and some physical preparation.

Exercises for reducing weight at home and at the gym are not that dissimilar. They must be efficient, intense, and diverse. The press may be worked out at home or in the gym with similar results. You can collaborate with a trainer over a video link.

Circuit training is one of the best option to burn calories.

Circuit training targets the entire body and successfully burns calories. Exercises should be completed progressively, with a minimum rest duration of up to 25 seconds between elements. A cycle or circle can have four to eight activities. Each must be done for a certain amount of time or with the required number of repetitions. Relaxation can be put in the spaces between the circles.

This training plan is appropriate for both beginners and advanced athletes; simply pay attention to your feelings and alter the amount of laps. It is recommended to complete 4–6 rounds every workout, two to three times per week.

Circuit training is frequently referred to as fat burning.

Because exercise involves a large number of joints, ligaments, and muscles, it burns more calories. A general tone will arise within a month if you workout at least three times each week.

It is preferable to measure progress by measuring volume in the waist, chest, and hips: the numbers on the scales may not move, but the improvement will be seen physically. This is crucial for motivating you to keep training.

Measure progress by measuring volume in the waist, chest, and hips.

To keep the workouts interesting, switch exercises and replace them with new ones. When endurance activities are included in circuit training, the calorie expenditure is 30% more than when strength training in the gym.

Begin with short sessions and progressively increase the amount of circles. You can burn out and quit training if you expect a speedy result and quickly tire yourself.

Before you begin training, check with your doctor to see if you have any limits on physical exercise.

Warming Up

A series of exercises at the beginning is aimed at warming up the muscles and ligaments before physical activity. It allows you to train much more efficiently, to avoid injuries and sprains.

In the warm-up, you should include cardio heating: jumping rope, walking with raising your knees or jogging in place. Then you need to do articular gymnastics: rotation with your hands, arms, shoulders, head, etc. Now you can stretch for 2–3 minutes — you need to lock your arms behind your back to stretch the shoulder joints, make bends to the sides.

Finish the warm-up with the same cardio exercises as in the beginning, but at a higher pace. Then you need to restore breathing, alternating deep inhalation and exhalation.

If there is no physical level of preparation at all, the warm-up can be reduced to 5 minutes.

Frontal Lunges

This exercise will help strengthen the inner thighs.

For a frontal lunge to the side, you need to stand up straight and keep your feet shoulder-width apart. Now take a step to the side and squat. We do not transfer the body weight completely to one side, but evenly distribute it between both legs. We make sure that the body does not fall to one side, and the knee does not go beyond the toe of the foot.

Now you need to push off with the leg on which the lunge was performed, take an additional step and take the starting position. We repeat the actions — we perform a lunge in the other direction. Legs should be widely spaced apart. The duration of frontal lunges is 2–3 minutes.

Frontal Lunges. The Plan of Motion.

Push-Ups

If you have physical fitness, you can choose classic push-ups. If it’s too difficult for now, I recommend doing them from your knees.

It is necessary to take the correct starting position: the body forms a single line from the head without bending in the lower back or lifting the pelvis up. We place our palms exactly under the shoulder joints, place the elbows close to the body and do not spread them to the sides.

The body should drop low. It is important to breathe correctly: we bend our arms as we inhale, rise as we exhale. We perform the exercise for 2 minutes.

For push-ups from the knees, the technique is the same: the body forms a straight line. It is necessary to monitor the position of the palms relative to the shoulders.

During the exercise, only the muscles and joints of the arms should work. The rest of the joints should be stable, that is, motionless during training.

Be a “Rock Climber”

This exercise is also called a rock climber. It can be performed in two versions. The first one is for trained athletes, at high speed — with imitation of running or climbing to the top in the bar. At a low pace, beginners can do the exercise.

We stand so that the palms are exactly under the shoulders, we strain the stomach and tighten the pelvis so that the body forms one line, as in push-ups. The press must be tense to maintain the correct position of the body.

First, we pull one leg with the knee to the chest, then we return it to its place, then we pull up the other, imitating a run. We quickly change legs, pulling either the right or the left knee to the chest. The exercise should be done for at least 2 minutes.

Mountain Climber. The Plan of Motion.

Burpees

This powerful exercise uses the muscles of your core, shoulder girdle, arms, legs, and buttocks.

We stand up straight, put our feet shoulder-width apart. We put our hands on the floor and do a deep squat. Without lifting our palms from the floor, we make a jump, straighten our legs and stand in the plank position. It is necessary to ensure that the palms are exactly under the shoulders, and the body forms one straight line.

Now we bend the elbows along the body and touch the floor with the chest. In this case, the body must remain level. We return to the plank position, with a jump we press our knees to the chest, then we sharply jump up with our arms raised. During the execution of burpee, you need to keep your back straight and look in front of you. We do the exercise for 1–2 minutes.

Usually, people see results after a month of performing them, but nevertheless, do not forget about nutrition for achieving better results and stretching after training all muscles.

During stretching, the greatest attention should be paid to Hip Flexors as they are the most important muscles responsible for many details both in training and for physical condition outside of it. For such muscles there is a unique program for their improvement and stretching, which leads to an improvement in physical performance.

For bodyweight exercise to help you lose weight, it must be intense and prolonged. Simply put, if you do 20 squats and then rest for five minutes, you will certainly strengthen your muscles, but you won’t burn a lot of calories.

Therefore, do the exercises at high intensity, or even better, include them in interval training with a certain amount of rest between sets — from 10 seconds to one minute. This will keep your heart rate high throughout your workout and burn more calories.

Also, remember that no workout will help you lose weight unless you review your diet. Combine exercise with diet and you will see the first results very soon. This is your time to become the best version of yourself.

How I Naturally Transformed My Body Composition in 1 Year,"My Training Splits

Over the past three months, I’ve noticed the most improvement in my physique by breaking out my training splits to upper body push/pull days and then incorporating 2x core days and 1x leg day (or I would split up legs into two days with my core). For those that are new to the terms (as I was six months ago), a push workout is where your muscles contract when weight is pushed away from your body. These muscle groups include chest, shoulders, triceps, quads, and calves. A pull workout, in turn, is where your muscles contract when weight is pulled towards your body these muscle groups include your traps, back, biceps, hams, obliques.

So, as opposed to breaking out my training days such as the following example:

Split 1

Monday — arms/back

Tuesday — core + legs

Wednesday — arms/back

Thursday — core + legs

You could do something like this:

Split 2

Monday — Pull upper body workout (biceps/back)

Tuesday — Pull leg workout (hamstrings/obliques) + core

Wednesday — Push upper workout (chest/shoulders/triceps)

Thursday — Push leg workout (quads/calves) + core

Split 1 was the workout I had been using for years and split 2 is more along the lines of how I train now. However, as I write this, I only use the push/pull method for my upper body. Now, into the breakdown of the exact routine I’m using now.

Strength training

For each session, I’ll choose five different exercises for each muscle group and aim for the 8–15 rep range for most exercises (also including a few exercises with higher reps). I’ll repeat each exercise three times (or three sets per exercise):

Monday — Upper body pull — (biceps/back)

Tuesday — Core + legs

Wednesday — Upper body push (shoulders/triceps/chest)

Thursday — Core

Friday — Upper body pull — (biceps/back)

Saturday — Upper body push (shoulders/triceps/chest)

Sunday — No strength

My upper body sessions usually take around an hour or so, and lower body + core around 30–45 minutes. I stick to my upper body splits religiously; however, I’m loose with my leg days. Depending on how I’m feeling, I’ll split my leg day out in two (with core), just once with core, or I’ll separate it out altogether and do legs in its own session on Sunday. This varies week by week.

I’ll typically follow the same routine for a few weeks, and then I’ll add in a few new exercises for each major muscle group and switch up the order. In order to see growth, your workouts need to be challenging and each set should push your muscles to fatigue. Otherwise, they will have no reason to grow. I used to always tell my clients to lift until they physically cannot lift anymore — then do one more rep.

On the topic of muscle growth, an important term worth mentioning is progressive overload. Progressive overload involves increasing weight, reps, frequency of training, and/or decreasing rest periods week-over-week. This is vital in order to see any physical changes to your body. I’m not going to add too much detail about the subject in this post, but I will add some additional reading on the topic in the footnotes if you’re interested in learning more.

Cardio

If you’re one of the people that believe cardio is the way to lose weight, you’re right, but also, very wrong. Let me explain. Cardio burns calories, and at the end of the day, in order to lose weight, you need a calorie deficit. You need a deficit of 3,500 calories to lose 1 lb of body fat. You can expedite this process by doing more cardio, as it typically burns more calories than strength training. However, if you’re only doing cardio, you’re much more likely to experience big fluctuations in weight gain and loss, as your body composition will remain relatively the same. If you do strength training, on the other hand, you build muscle, and muscle burns more calories than fat does.

By doing strength training, although it can be deceiving as it doesn’t burn more calories at the moment, the lean muscle mass you build will burn more calories in the long run while also increasing your resting metabolism. There’s been a long-standing myth (which I fell prey to as well), that for every pound of muscle mass you have, you burn an extra 50 calories per day during rest. This has been disproven and replaced with a more accurate statistic: 1 pound of muscle burns approximately 7–10 calories per day, and every 1 pound of fat burns around 2–3 calories per day at rest. Strength training is also what will really move the needle with your body composition. Cardio has its place. for sure. As aforementioned, cardio can burn more calories (so you can eat more), is great for heart health, reduces the risk of disease, etc, etc.

Now that I’ve provided a brief summary on cardio, here’s a breakdown of my what my cardio split looks like:

Monday — Steady-state run 8km/5 mile run (outdoor or treadmill)

Tuesday — High-intensity interval training treadmill 8km/5 mile run

Wednesday — Steady-state run (lower mileage day usually 5–7km)

Thursday -High-intensity interval training treadmill 10km/6.25 mile run

Friday — Steady-state run 8k run (outdoor or treadmill) run

Saturday — High-intensity interval training treadmill 8km/5 mile run

Sunday — Slow long run (+10k/6.25 miles)

I incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT) runs three times per week to help build up my lactic thresholds and endurance.",https://betterhumans.pub/how-i-naturally-transformed-my-body-composition-in-1-year-481b58dea559,['Emily Rudow'],2022-01-31 19:45:05.973000+00:00,"['Health', 'Fitness', 'Nutrition', 'Fitness Tips', 'Self Improvement']"
How to Become a Hardware Engineer?,"With the development of technology, engineering began to take its place in almost every field. The biggest reason for this is that projects are started to be made in every sector and engineers are needed to prepare these projects. Hardware engineers are also one of the important engineering branches needed. Although the software is often needed in long-term projects, hardware is also needed on the other hand. At this point, hardware engineering is needed as much as software engineering.

Hardware engineers are people who follow the design process of computer components, including circuit boards, processors, and memory cards. In order to become a hardware engineer, it is required to graduate with a bachelor’s degree from Computer Engineering, Electrical — Electronics Engineering, and one of the related departments, which provide four-year education at universities. It is also important that they continue their development processes uninterruptedly since their graduation.

What is a hardware engineer? What does a hardware engineer do? How much salary does a hardware engineer earn? You can find the answers you are looking for to questions:

They check the operation of the equipment and make the necessary changes to ensure that the system works in accordance with the technical specifications.

They determine power supply needs.

They analyze user needs and recommend appropriate equipment to relevant persons or organizations.

They update existing computer equipment to work with new software.

They evaluate factors such as the need for cost and security constraints to determine hardware configuration.

In the product development and application process; they provide technical support to the design team, marketing and sales departments, suppliers, other engineers, and all team members.

They prepare statistical reports and present them to the management department.

They follow the innovations in the field of hardware and continue their professional development.

Hardware Engineer Salaries

The minimum education requirement to become a hardware engineer is usually a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering or a similar discipline. However, having a master’s degree can increase their success in the profession. Graduating from a Higher Education approved program can also attract the attention of a hiring manager. For hardware engineers who want to work in a leadership position, having an MBA will be the right move.

It is very important to follow the developments in this field and to continue the development in order to be aware of the technological advances. It is possible to talk about better job opportunities for graduates who improve themselves. Some institutions provide support training for personal development. In addition, companies that care about language education primarily prefer candidates with high foreign language knowledge. Let’s examine the salaries of hardware engineers.

According to the opinion of the Occupational Statistics Bureau, the average annual salary for hardware engineers is around 115,000 TL.

The lowest hardware engineer salary is seen as 66,000 TL per year in Turkey.

The highest-earning hardware engineer earns a salary of approximately 177,000 TL per year.

In 2019, approximately 74,000 Americans continued their work as hardware engineers. It is predicted that this number will increase to approximately 78,000 in 2029. The resulting increase in the number of common devices using embedded computer chips seems likely to add to the need for hardware engineers.

How to Become a Hardware Engineer

Candidates who want to be a hardware engineer first research what kind of education they should get. Apart from this, they also research what kind of career path they will have as a result of the education they receive.

How to Get Out of Debt — Embrace Frugality,"How to Get Out of Debt — Embrace Frugality

Often times frugality has a negative connotation. Personally, I think the negative vibes should be directed towards the $90,460 of debt the average American carries with them. But there is a light amidst this darkness. It is possible to get out of debt. One of the first steps (among many) to achieve this goal is to embrace frugality.

There’s no shame in being frugal when you’re working towards a goal. I’ll explain how you can slow your spending without feeling like you’re a pompous penny pincher or that you’ll pass away from a severe case of boredom.

The suggestions below are stepping stones. They’re not meant to wipe out your debt over night. The goal is to shift into a mindset that embraces frugality so you can utilize that frugal mindset during your debt-free journey, which will ultimately speed up the process and allow you to become debt free sooner rather than later.

Budget

I’ll die on this hill. The most important tool for managing your money is keeping a budget. This is the script that shows you what you can comfortably and responsibly spend your money on.

I recommend using the zero-based budget. I wrote an article about this and offered some free tools here. This method of budgeting requires you to allocate your money to certain spending categories (or just allocate the money in general) prior to you actually spending the money. You designate a certain amount of money to each category until you theoretically have zero dollars left to budget. Now you know exactly what you can spend your money on and you can do so comfortably.

Look for cash-back opportunities

If you’re going to be spending money, you might as well get a little kickback in return. Often when cash-back opportunities are legitimate, you’ll find that you won’t be raking in dollars, but when you’re working towards your goal of getting out of debt, every little bit counts. I’ll get you started with some cash-back opportunities below.

Credit Cards

First, I recommend using a credit card that offers cash back when you use it. The Discover it card earns 5% cash back on everyday purchases at different establishments each quarter. Amazon, grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations are included in this list. You also earn 1% cash back on all other purchases when using the card. And to top it off, Discover matches the cash back you’ve earned dollar for dollar for the first year.

I currently use this card for most of my everyday purchases, and so far, I have earned about $156.00 (which Discover will match, giving me an additional $156.00).

Note: Credit cards are a great tool only if you use them responsibly. I explain how to use credit cards with your budget here: A simple strategy to manage your credit cards and avoid debt.

Apps

One app in particular that I like to recommend is GetUpside. This app gives you cash back when you purchase gas, go out to eat or get groceries in select areas and at select establishments. You’re going to be getting gas no matter what. You might as well get money back for doing it. Also, I use my Discover it card when getting gas, so I get cash back from the card and from the app. Double dipping in some free money.

Here’s my in-depth look at GetUpside: How to earn cash back when you get gas, go out to eat, or get groceries.

Food

I’m giving food its own section because it’s easy to go overboard here, especially when you’re hungry.

Grocery shopping

I’ve gotten a fair share of WTFs when telling people that I used to only allow myself to spend about $25 on groceries every two weeks. It seems impossible, sure. But I did it.

Where you shop is important. Aldi is a wonderful place for budget-conscious folks. It’s a grocery store that sells mostly “exclusive brand” items. The prices are so much lower than the standard stores like Giant Eagle or Wal-Mart. And to boot, they claim to have “removed certified synthetic colors, added MSG, and partially hydrogenated oils from all of our exclusive brand food products.”

If you don’t have an Aldi in your area, check to see if there’s a similar budget-friendly store.

My strategy for grocery shopping on a tight budget was to only purchase food that I could eat for more than one meal. For example, I would often make chili, make multiple meals from ground turkey, quinoa bowls, pasta, snack on fruits and veggies, etc. You can get creative with your recipes and make some great-tasting and healthy meals that you can eat more than once.

Restaurants

I had no shame in scanning the menu for a low-priced meal when I was out to eat. I kept my ear to the ground for specials on certain days like half-off sushi day. If I wanted a beer with my meal, I didn’t go for the specialty craft beers. I was fine with the domestic that was the beer of the day. When I was finished eating, and I had food leftover, you know I was gettin’ myself a box to take that food home so I could eat it later.

The point is — you can get a satisfying and healthy meal at a restaurant without breaking the budget. Have fun and have sense/cents about it.

Vehicles

You don’t need a new car. You don’t need a new car payment. You’ve heard it before, but it’s true — once you drive off the lot, you now have a used car.

There’s absolutely nothing wrong with driving an older, used car. Even if it’s a little beat up. That’s character. As long as it’s getting you where you need to go then, that’s all that matters. You can save so much money when you shop for used cars vs new cars. Just do the research to find a solid, affordable used vehicle.

Where you live

I understand that adjusting your living situation can be hard. However, if you can do it, it’s worth it. I currently live with two roommates (I used to have three) in a not-so-expensive part of town that’s still safe. So rent and utilities are cut into thirds. With this combo, I’m saving a lot of money. And the kicker — part of the money I make from the band that I’m in pays for my rent. So, in essence, I live rent-free.

I don’t plan to have roommates forever. But for now, there’s no reason for me to triple (or more) my monthly spending just so I can live alone.

Again, I understand that this isn’t possible for everyone. But living expenses are a big expense. If you can find ways to lower these expenses, it is absolutely worth it monetarily.

Clothing

I love a good thrift store. I go thrifting a couple of times a week. I’ve found so many good pieces of clothing while thrifting. Aside from the price difference when buying used clothing vs new, thrifting has sustainability and environmental perks. You’re not contributing to resources required to make and ship new clothes, potentially reducing clothes that will end up in a landfill, etc. I also recommend checking out estate sales for good deals on clothing and household items. Check out EstateSales.net.

Another perk of spending time in thrift stores is that you can find items that you can flip, which can be a great side hustle to earn some extra money.

Save your spare change

This is a slow but sure way build a little money reserve. I always save my spare change. I have jar on my dresser that I plop the change into whenever I get home. You’d be surprised how much you can accumulate over time.

When my jar is full, I take it to a Coinstar machine and it counts my change for me and gives me a receipt with a dollar amount. Then I take that receipt to the customer service desk in the store that the Coinstar machine is in and they give me cash in return.

Coinstar does charge a fee for processing the money but it’s not much. It beats having to roll the change manually.

Entertain yourself for free

You don’t have to throw down serious cash to have a good time. There is plenty of fun to be had at little to no cost to you. Here are some things that I enjoy doing that are completely free or close to it:

Hiking — explore new parks and trails

Open mics

Learning a new skill for a side hustle or to create something

Go to the movies (look for special prices during the week)

Visit family

Simply driving around and exploring aimlessly

Watch YouTube videos to learn something new

Listen to audiobooks and podcasts

Find new music

Attend a class

How These 11 Side Hustles Made Me Over $16k,"How These 11 Side Hustles Made Me Over $16k

“Side hustle” gets thrown around a lot online, but I learned why — side hustling is worth it.

During my efforts to become debt free, side hustles were crucial. I was ready to do just about anything that I was capable of to get some extra cash. Here are a handful of jobs I worked:

Commercial real estate photography

Photography at a comedy club

Freelance web development

Freelance graphic design

Bartending

Yard Work

Flipping items

Podcast editing

Performing

Craigslist

Craigslist is a great place to find odd jobs. Albeit potentially sketchy sometimes, I’ve never had a bad experience with the jobs I’ve worked that I found on Craigslist.

The best way to find jobs on Craigslist is to check the “gigs” listing for your area and surrounding areas. You can either select specific gig categories or you can just look at all of the current gigs listed. I recommend looking at all the gigs incase you see something that you’re capable of doing in a category you wouldn’t have checked specifically.

Craigslist was how I got my yard work and bartending jobs.

Bartending

I’m not a great bartender. I wouldn’t even say I’m good at it. But I was fired up about paying off my debt. So when I saw a job listing for a wedding reception bartender, I jumped on it.

I knew no one at the reception but I ended up having a good time. Most of the drinks requested we simple one-to-two ingredient drinks.

Total earnings: About $200

Yard work

For the type of yard work I was doing, you didn’t really need specific skills. I would just show up at this random lady’s house and clean out her flower beds and tend to the rest of the yard.

Total earnings: About $500

Wonolo

Wonolo is a on-demand staffing application that links business looking to hire people for temporary work.

I don’t use Wonolo much any more but it did help me find a side hustle that I’ve been working for about two years.

Commercial real estate photography

This is a simple job. I work with a real estate company in a different state and take photos of properties to ensure loan money is being used as it was intended. I show up, take the photos with my phone and send them to the real estate company. I earn $50 — $100 per property.

Total earnings: About $3,000

Community/Connections

This one is important. It has been the most effective method for finding side hustles. I will say that, in my case specifically, I had specific skills that people in my circle were looking for. However, I was not particularly great at these skills, but I was willing to try.

Freelance web development (Job 1)

I knew I wanted to learn web development for a while. So I finally did it. I started learning with freeCodeCamp. It taught me basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It took me a while to find work. While I was job hunting, however, I would work on projects of my own to sharpen my skills.

One of the first “jobs” I took was from a friend who needed a website for a business they started. I built the website for free because I knew I needed to start a portfolio to show future clients my past work. I was also happy to gain the experience.

Freelance web development (Job 2):

Jump back to Craigslist. While I was perusing Craigslist for some potential gigs I saw a local marketing firm looking for a web developer intern. It was a paid position (nice). I took the job and worked select days during the week after my day job for about six months.

They didn’t offer me a permanent position but the other web developers I met at that company became friends. Those friendships led to a remote freelance position. They were doing freelance web dev work with a company out of Arizona. That company was looking to hire additional help and the developers I met from the internship recommended me. I took the position and eventually became their lead developer.

Total earnings: Over $6,000

Freelance web development (Job 3):

Working with the Arizona company was going well. It was primarily WordPress development. But I wanted to expand my web dev skills. While poking around on Facebook in a web developer group I was a part of, I saw someone post about a free class in my area that was teaching Python and Django.

In short, I joined that class, became friends with the teacher, taught some of the classes and worked on freelance projects using the skills I learned from that class.

I learned a lot from this endeavor. I also became part of a great entrepreneurial/tech community because of this class.

Total earnings: Over $2,000

Fun fact: Because I learned these web development skills, I was able to land a day job that more than doubled my previous salary.

Freelance graphic design

Again while scrolling around on Facebook I saw someone looking for a graphic designer to create posters for their radio show. I wasn’t the cream of the crop when it came to graphic design by any stretch of the imagination but I knew my way around Photoshop.

I reached out, told them what I’d like to be paid based on my skillset and sealed the deal. They hired me for multiple posters.

Total earnings: About $240

Photography at a comedy club

I’m friends with someone who is well-connected in my area. He’s a solid guy and always looking to help out those who are trying to make their ideas come to life.

This relationship led to a meeting at one of the most popular comedy clubs in town. They wanted to shoot photos of the performers as they were doing their set. Additionally, they wanted photos of the patrons who were attending the shows. My friend knew I was dabbling in photography and asked if I’d be interested in shooting those photos. I agreed and worked at the comedy club on random weekends for about six months.

Total earnings: About $1,500

UpWork

I was only able to pick up a couple jobs on UpWork. As a musician I knew my way around Apple Logic (a digital audio workstation). I was also a big fan of podcasting. So I figured I’d try my hand at podcast editing.

As a new freelancer on the site it took some time to get clients but I did get them. I worked a couple of jobs and earned a little bit of money. While I was able to make money, I didn’t see UpWork as a great way to continue to look for jobs — for me anyway.

Total earnings: About $240

Performing

Like I mentioned above, I’m a musician. Most of the time I’m performing with my band. But when I find a venue that’s looking for solo artists, I jump on on the opportunity. Most of my solo gigs are booked during the week which leaves weekends open for the band when we’re not traveling.

Total earnings: About $2000

Flipping items

I just started flipping items. Currently I have a few of listings on eBay. I’ve found that some of the best places to look for items to flip is at thrift stores and at estate sales.

I recommend checking out EstateSales.net to find estate sales near you.

Total earnings: About $1,000

Grand total: $ 16,680

Desmond Tutu Stood Among Giants at Global Racial Repair,"For sure, Tutu enjoyed an effortless relationship with leaders spanning across the world. His personal sway was marked by his seriousness and an exhaustive, searching disposition toward justice. He dedicated himself to the social and political changes needed to reform South African, even most doubted his tactics. Tutu’s connections with former president Nelson Mandela — who appointed Tutu to head the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in the 1990s — enabled him to foment healing across that country after Blacks and Coloreds had gained de jure civil rights in the country. Tutu stood as a remarkable moral broker; he served as a conduit through which so much acrimony across the nation was released. As chair of the commission he knew what was expected of him: commandeering a delicate balance between the bitter millions who had been oppressed under the weight of apartheid and the murderous predilections of the nation’s former White ruling class.

If there is a precise way of conveying the complexity of human compassion — a way in which Duke Ellington did through jazz or the manner in which Hugh Masekla captured in Afro-punk Jazz — Tutu gave utterance to such sentiment in his daily working and cry for freedom. During the nation’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission process, Tutu proved himself both as a paragon of cautionary calm and applied equanimity. This required, at onetime, Tutu’s ability to hold in check his rage as a victim of apartheid, while allotting also opportunities for Whites to see the errors of their wayward racial ideology. Tutu saw his role as a chaperone who would lead the way toward public lament, apology, repair and reconciliation. And Maskela would be helpful as a artistictically-bent sonic accompaniment during the pre-apartheird days of suffering. In his mid 30s, it would have been hard for the Holy Ghost-minded Tutu to not feel the effects of Masekela’s music — some of which served as anthems for the country’s hardboiled revolutionary freedom fighters. Grazing in the Grass is one of those tunes. It possessed a cultural muscularity that was unmistakable. Masekela would infused those in South Africa, like Tutu, who seemed beyond hope, those who wished and prayed for a North Star.

As much a practitioner of non-violence as he was a strategic planner in the realm of human rights, Tutu was able to galvanize the global imagination with wit and patience, command and a commitment to the integrity possessed by victims and muderous dictators fueled mostly by hate.

Perhaps because he had been inspired by the methodologies of American Civil Rights Movement leaders who sought to “redeem the soul of America” during the 1950s and 1960s, or because he had glimpsed the untidy results of the potential racial recriminations that could have easily been imposed by the majority of Black South Africans upon Afrikaners at the end of aparthied, Tutu acted countered productively: seeking a peaceful transition over some Black South Africans sought revesral and unilateral Black power— always raising his concerns about how he might help prevent his nation from sinking into a racial war of all against all.

Decades later, the ameliorative results Tutu sought are neither apparent nor entirely forthcoming as the nation continues its strides in the post aparhtied reality. Long after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) filed its lenghty findings, South Africa stands, in many ways, remarakbly divided along the lines of racial wealth inequality, housing segregation, heath disparities, and educational attainment.",https://medium.com/@thenewdemocracycoalition/desmond-tutu-stood-among-giants-at-global-racial-repair-87c8de41fc8f,['The New Democracy Coalition Of Massachusetts'],2022-01-10 01:26:17.108000+00:00,"['Desmond Tutu', 'Apartheid', 'South Africa', 'Reparations', 'Nelson Mandela']"
Omicron variant surge,"4,000 flights cancelled worldwide with South Africa ending contact tracing with the exception of prison clusters/outbreaks, where most of the population has been exposed to the virus variant. The variant is known to spread 4 times faster than the Delta variant. The variant neutralizes antibodies, implying even vaccinated citizens can be carriers, yet this does not examine the vaccine effectiveness, and a booster jab will still improve immune response.

Identification of Omicron variant:

- PCR test (Tests for the 3 covid genes: spike [S], nucleocapsid [N2], outer shell [E])

- Genomic sequencing for siting presence in a country.

- LFT (Lateral flow Tests)

Comparison of Omicron variant to Delta variant:

- Increase in transmissibility

- Increase in hostility

- Decrease in effectiveness from public health services (vaccines)

JohnHopkins medicine reinstated the hope for an overruling vaccine for all variants, “When the evidence is strong enough that a viral genetic change is causing a change in the behavior of the virus, we gain new insight regarding how this virus works. The virus seems to have some limitations in its evolution — the advantageous mutations are drawn from a relatively limited menu — so there is some hope that we might not see variants that fully escape our vaccines.”

Australia Omicron variant — reaching 90% vaccination population target, yet Omicron variant averages to 25,000 / day. PCR tests are limited.

Reliance on lateral flow tests caused tension on pricing, being $30 for one RAT (rapid antigen test), in comparison to being $1–2 in Europe.

How to Find Jobs in Canada (Off-Campus)| 7 Tips to Ensure You Land That Interview!,"If you are reading this post, first of all — Congratulations! You’ve reached a major milestone in your life — Be it completing school or simply having made the decision to look for new opportunities. And for those of you who are in the process of planning to move to Canada in order to further your career, great choice!

The tips and strategies I share in this post have certainly helped me in my journey to becoming a Business and Data Analytics professional and should generally apply to any kind of job-hunt, no matter the field or country; My personal experience, however, is rooted in Canada — particularly the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). I’ve had the fortune of facing the job-hunt twice since 2019 — once after graduating from my Master’s program as an international student and the other time while pivoting into a new role amidst the pandemic.

I find that the most prominent issue faced while seeking employment is the frustration surrounding not getting enough interview callbacks after having applied to a laundry list of jobs. It’s common for such feelings of frustration to compound into despair within no time especially if you’re a newcomer to the country, feeling the pressure of settling into a new country whilst managing your immigration status and finances. Well, I’m here to tell you that it’s perfectly normal to feel that way, and it’s all part of the process — A process that millions of us have lived through with much success

Hopefully, the tips I have to provide will prepare you to take the brunt of the job hunt (it rhymes!) and keep you on track to landing those interviews back to back.

Watch my YouTube video where I talk about this topic in detail, and with examples. If you’re crunched for time, no worries! Scroll below for a quick checklist of focus items (in that particular order).

1. LinkedIn is King

Set up your profile today and start connecting with professionals in your area of interest. Make sure your profile is complete and up to date.

Tip: Ensure search engines are indexing your profile in the search results by setting your profile link to public

2. Build a Personal Brand

Your online presence matters. Though optional, it is highly recommended you maintain an online portfolio showcasing your interests and skills. It could be a website, an article or a blog; a social media account, or an educational platform that you have contributed to (e.g YouTube, Kaggle, GitHub).

Food for thought: Imagine you are a recruiter at a large firm and want to know more about the candidate (yourself) in order to make a decision about contacting them. Where would you go?

3. Resumé Resumé Resumé

I cannot stress the importance of having a crisp, clean, and effective resume. It is so important that I had to say it thrice for effect! If you think about it, this is the one document showcasing your lifetime’s worth of experiences and achievements. So spend some time and craft it wisely.

Tip: Avoid using online resume templates that have graphics and symbols as Application Tracking Systems (ATS) are usually unable to accurately parse non-text objects. Wherever possible, upload the file in a Word .docx or .pdf format.

4. Build a Network (a.k.a Make Friends with Professionals)

In the process of building your personal brand and resume, you will have gained a better understanding of where your strengths and interests lie. It’s a good time to then start thinking about how you can leverage this newfound awareness to connect with like-minded professionals in the area of your interest. LinkedIn can be a great place to start extending your network beyond your peers from school or coworkers from previous jobs. Reach out to industry experts with the sole purpose of seeking information, advice, and/or support on challenges and experiences — You may even end up learning about a job opportunity not published online.

Networking is a good way to get insight into the industry and gives you an opportunity to learn from others’ experiences. It is also a great way to practice ‘selling’ your personal brand to others.

5. Find Jobs (Literally!)

Okay! By now you will have laid the foundation for your job search. You look great on paper, you look great online, and have even managed to make trusted friends in organizations who can potentially vouch for your greatness! The next step is to actually perform the search. Indeed, Glassdoor and Randstad are some popular job boards. Personally, LinkedIn is my most preferred platform when it comes to learning about different companies and job vacancies. I would also recommend attending career fairs to learn about companies that are actively hiring and/or companies that you would not have heard of otherwise. Once you’ve done your homework and shortlisted a set of target companies that you think would be a good fit, simply log in to their respective careers websites and start an application!

6. Customize your Resume and Cover Letter

Tailor your resume and cover letter with the keywords mentioned in the job description. This is particularly helpful in case companies are using AI tools to match candidates’ applications with the posted job description. Besides the benefit of passing AI checks, using the same jargon as the company can help the recruiter better understand how you could potentially add value to their team.

7. Be Open to Learning

Chances are there will be multiple job listings that match your interests exactly but you find that you only meet, say, 60% of their criteria for eligibility. Don’t be discouraged, but also avoid applying for it just to try your luck. Make an effort to close any gaps in your skillset by taking up online courses or by doing some extra reading on the side (this prepares you for more types of opportunities, in fact!). Hiring Managers appreciate when you go the extra mile to improve yourself.

In Conclusion

In all likelihood, you’ll be switching jobs a couple of times in your career, and having a framework that you can build from is super advantageous. Hopefully, I’ve been able to help you lay the foundation for the journey you’re about to embark on with this post. I wish I could tell you that there was one tried-and-tested job-hunt strategy that works for everyone, but unfortunately, there isn’t :(

Rest assured, you will learn something new in this process — something that’s unique to your own journey. It’s all onward and upward thereafter. Good luck!

Resume Building Tips And Tricks,"Your Resume is the most widely used document for job applications in North America, displaying qualifications such as individual skills, qualifications, and job history. However, the resume is even more confusing for Europeans accustomed to CVs, as it takes a lot of effort and serious strain to prepare even for a native North American.

That brings to mind the question, “ Is it really that difficult to prepare a document with a maximum of 2 pages? “ Actually, it is not. Or it would be more correct to say if you can distinguish a quality resource from a bad source on Google and know how important the special recruiters of the organization you are going to apply to this issue. Your job is not as difficult as it is exaggerated.

Of course, this is true for a moderately smooth resume. But, on the other hand, you can also prepare a high-level resume that can be shown as a “legend” by paying companies that do this job professionally. Of course, as in every subject, there is no limit in this regard, but the important thing is that we do this work ourselves and do not have to pay anywhere. The purpose of this article is to give you tips and tricks to achieve this. Let’s learn more…

The Difference Between Resume and CV:

CV is the most common format throughout Europe, The Middle East, Asia, and much of South America. A resume is used in all fields other than medicine and some academic jobs in Canada and the USA. If you are asked to use a CV, it is indicated in the job announcement. Although they coined its name as CV, a unique format is used between Resume and CV in the UK.

While CV generally includes personal information (marital status, age, military service) and photograph, these are not used in resumes. Especially avoid photographing resumes because, according to a study, 88% of resumes with photos go directly to the garbage without being read at all.

CVs are usually 2–3 pages long, and even longer, there is no problem. A resume shouldn’t be more than two pages long, 1–1.5 is ideal. According to another research, a recruiting employee spends an average of 30 seconds examining each resume. Therefore, your resume should be short, direct, and purposeful.

Another difference is the frequency of writing and the purpose. The CV written once can also be used for other job applications, regardless of the position and job applied for. This is because you add a new experience and skill if you happen to acquire it. In addition to this, a resume is written separately according to each job and position applied; hence it is more specific.

What is a Resume? How is it Prepared?

Aim:

As mentioned above, the purpose of writing a resume is not to display all your knowledge, experience, every education you have received, and your entire career. On the contrary, the resume focuses heavily on the job/position applied for.

For example, suppose you have studied sociology and economics, and you are going to apply for a credit officer position in a bank. In that case, you should not mention your sociology undergraduate study or you previously worked as a teacher. Now you are applying for a human resources position; in this case, you should not mention the sales representative in your resume. The basic logic is to talk about the work experience and academic background directly related to the position applied for.

Structure:

The key point here is length. It is good if you can fit it on one page, 1.5 pages are not bad, and 2 pages should be an upper limit. If you go over this 2-page limit, your resume will probably go to the waste bin without reading. To deal with the length, there are a few more important rules about the structure:

Choose a legible font, avoid fancy and waxed fonts; Cambria or Arial is fine.

You should use the same font throughout the article; for example, Ariel in the “Work Experience” section, Cambria in the “Education” section, and Times News Romance in the “Summary” section is not a good means.

You can play around with the font size, provided that it is not too radical. For example, it is fine to use 14 size fonts for headings and 12 size fonts for normal body text.

Avoid italic and underline as much as possible as they make it difficult to read. You can use Bold.

You can put the date in the upper right corner in the form of a header (it should be on every page).

As with any text, use spacing between lines that makes it easier to read. If you have enough space, double spacing is ideal. If not enough, it should be 1.15 at least.

Format:

In a resume, a few items in the format may vary by country, but the general rule is as follows:

a. Heading/Contact Information:

This is the personal information part that we know very well (let’s not forget that we do not include personal information such as age, photo, marital status, etc.). In this section, we write our name, surname, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and LinkedIn URL information, if available.

It would be better to write your name and surname in bold. If your resume consists of more than one page, you must have your name and surname on every page.

b. Profile Summary:

This part is the summary part that we talk about in a maximum of 4–5 lines. Avoid using personal pronouns (“I”, “Me”, “We”) in this section and throughout the resume. For example, instead of starting with “I am a result-driven marketing specialist who…” we should introduce ourselves “A result-driven marketing specialist who is eager to learn every day…”

c. Skills:

This part is how we state our specialty, competencies, knowledge, and skills. For example, technical Skills, Soft Skills, Transferable Skills, IT skills, the software you can use, your features, problem-solving skills, writing skills, organizational skills, etc., can be specified here.

Around 6 lines and 12 items are ideal.

d. Education:

As the name suggests, it is the section where you mention your academic background. If your work experience is more than your education, you can add work experience to item 4 and education to item 5. Let us remind you again, only include your educational background related to the position you applied for. Additionally, never include other educational information unrelated to the position you applied for.

e. Professional Experience:

Again, as the name suggests, this section is entirely devoted to working experience. To put it emphatically, in this section, mention only your work experience related to the job and position you applied for.

f. Additional Information:

If you have a significant interest, hobby, or related professional organizations and volunteer activities you are a member of, you can write briefly to this section. The key is to keep it short and not go into detail.

Language to Use:

First of all, you should use formal language, as you can guess.

There should be no grammatical errors, spelling, and punctuation errors in your Resume. Thus, read at least 2–3 times before submitting your resume and get support from an expert if necessary.

Use action verbs that express self-confidence and action. What are these action verbs? Managed, challenged, built, earned, boosted, chaired, accomplished There are dozens of them. You can find the ones that will work for you with a simple Google search.

Based on the logic of the necessity of using action verbs, avoid using verbs and expressions that express insecurity such as “I feel, I believe”. For instance, rather than saying, “I believe that I can be a substantial component for your organization”, say “I am confident that I can be a substantial component for your organization”.

Stop ruining your RÉSUMÉ.,"by: Priyansh Khodiyar

So you think you have a good enough resume to get shortlisted for any interview?

Think twice.

According to a recent CareerBuilder study, these mistakes in your resume would get you disqualified immediately:

Bad grammar and typos (77%)

(77%) Unprofessional email address (35%)

email address (35%) No quantifiable achievements on a resume (34%)

on a resume (34%) Long paragraphs of text blocks instead of bullet points (25%)

points (25%) A generic resume that’s not tailored to the job (18%)

resume that’s not tailored to the job (18%) Resume longer than two pages (17%)

(17%) No cover letter attached (10%) (Optional)

“It is your Resume, not your team’s resume, not your mentor’s resume not your manager’s resume, so talk about yourself.”

A good resume is one that:

Beats the other 250 resumes in the recruitment process.

in the recruitment process. Goes past the ATS scan(read on)

scan(read on) Earns more than 7 seconds of the recruiter’s attention.

But,

I get it Resumes are too boring, but they get you a job.

17 mistakes that people generally make.

You probably won’t finish this article. In fact, I may have already lost you to another tab in your browser. Or an email from your boss. Or a ping from a coworker. Or any number of other digital distractions that have come to define your modern life. If you are here, why not share this with 2 friends?

The following is my knowledge about resumes accumulated over a period of 2.5 years and so one can say it took me years to write this article. :)

Mistake 1: GRAPHICS

Left to Right? Which one would you choose?

So, you got 3 stars at Javascript? What does this tell me? — Nothing.

Mistake 2: CREATIVITY

Do not be too creative with your resume.

A resume is not the right place for your creativity. The recruiter sees 100s of resumes each day, what if everyone had a different resume format?

It will be very hard for a recruiter to understand each resume format and look at proper places to see your details.

After your resume has passed the initial screening, it gets a lot of attention so give it a personal touch (optional, just 1 line)

eg — I have traveled to 5 countries in the past 2 months,

Dinner with Elon Musk,

Danced with Hillary Clinton, or something like that.(more on this at the end)

Not something like using a fancy font.

Wow, I really hate this now.

Please Use Good Resume Fonts:

Times New Roman, Georgia, Helvetica, Arial Narrow, Calibri, Cambria.

Use a 12-point font.

Mistake 3: OBJECTIVE

c’mon man you can do better

You wasted two lines telling me you’re looking for a position in software engineering. Of course, they know it.

That’s the whole point someone is looking at your resume.

Is there anyone shouting out loud “Hey man look I am not a hard worker” NO!

Unless you have a unique objective statement, don’t include one. We know your objective is to get an internship/job. That’s why you’re applying.

Write something (if at all) more like this. ⬇

Mistake 4: FORMATTING AND COLOR

You need some space. You really need some space.

Fix your alignment disaster.

Prioritize Important Sections, have consistency in the entire resume.

Being consistent means if you are applying for a Frontend(FE) role, there’s no point mentioning how good you are in Machine learning.

as colorful as a rainbow.

Do not use more than 2 colors.

Do not complicate, keep it simple. don’t make a designer resume.

Do not include a photo unless asked. Including a photo is rarely a good idea.

Use a different shade of black as shown below ⬇

Mistake 5: NOT USING A TEMPLATE

You know how hard it is if your ‘creatively designed’ resume suddenly flashes before the eyes of the person scanning your resume and then they have to look around and be like:

— ‘Where the heck is his education and skills mentioned? Top? No, Bottom? No, Oh there you go, right in the middle of nowhere.’

Please use standard templates like these. (you can edit this template)

Totally killed it.

More like this(7–8) can be found in this google drive link here.

Or use this template — https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H6skY0Lh7jMJDdsWKcbPCjP9I34yw0v0/view

Some more:

Mistake 6: YOUR EMAIL

Quick Tips:

Do not use _underscores.

use _underscores. Avoid the letters ‘O’, ‘i’, ‘o’ and ‘L’, and numbers ‘1’ and ‘0’ as `O0o` is difficult to differentiate.

Bad Ones:

its_me_rahul@gmail.com

cat_lover43@yahoo.com

10403rahul@gmail.com

Good Ones:

FirstNameLastName@<provider>.com

LastNameFirstName@<provider>.com

elizabeth.smith@email.com or esmith@email.com

Mistake 7: SKILLS

“Don’t add Irrelevant Skills or Basic Skills Everyone Expects You to Have.”

Soft Skills:

Communication, Teamwork, Time Management,

Leadership, Detail Oriented, Problem Solving, Critical Thinking,

Decision Making, Customer Service, Self Motivation.

Hard Skills:

Big Data Analysis, Social Media Experience, Project Management,

Skills, Programming, Technical Writing,

Computer Skills, Debugging, Troubleshooting, Network Security.

Mention only relevant tech skills according to the job profile and not every technical skill that you have.

For Software Engineer :

Not Important — HTML, MS-Word, MS-Excel, Powerpoint — are unnecessary. They dilute your resume.

Also, do not list down the 5 languages you can speak and your proficiency in each. Totally irrelevant.

Machine Learning Engineer

For Cloud Engineers:

Tech: AWS API/GCP/Azure CLI, Kubernetes, Go.

DB: Hadoop/Spark/Flink/Kafka/Redis/Cassandra

Infra: OpenStack, Docker, Cloud Foundry, AWS ELB

For Backend Engineers: Sample

Tech: ASP.NET Core, Spring-Boot Framework, Java, C#, Git, NodeJs, Laravel, Ruby on Rails.

DB: RDBMS or NoSQL

Infra: Salesforce & Adobe AEM/CQ (CMS and CRM)

For Frontend Engineers:

Tech: React, Angular, Vue, Javascript, Flask, Django, jQuery, Bootstrap.

Material-UI, antd.

Adobe Creative Suite — Photoshop, Illustrator, In Design, Fireworks.

For DevOps Engineer:

Tools: Puppet, Ansible, Chef, JIRA, saltstack, Opsworks, Cloud Formation, Jenkins, Maven, Gradle

System’s Engineer

Mistake 8: EXTRA and UNNECESSARY DETAILS

Signature and Photograph (unless relevant to the position)

Social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram. Unless relevant to the position)

Full education History right from nursery to elementary till graduation, mention recent education only.

Personal details like Birthdate, Age, Gender, Marital status, Religion, or Nationality.

Full native address.

A list of all your previous roles and responsibilities.

Your salary expectation.

Have you ever seen a 20-something with a CEO, CFO, CMO, or any manner of executive job title in their resume? It’s pretty common these days with the proliferation of startups. Such titles aren’t always impressive though.

Mistake 9: MISSING IMPORTANT DETAILS

[Include this if you are applying for software roles]

LinkedIn profile and Github account and repository links for your projects.

Overall GPA of your degree. [Unless your GPA is greater than 3.6/5.0 or 7.0/10.0, don’t include it. The only thing it does is discount you and lower your chances of being selected over higher GPA candidates.]

Your position and rank in relevant competitions (coding contests like ACM ICPC, hackathons)

Mistake 10: TONE OF YOUR RESUME

Use Active, not Passive Voice.

“I did” rather than “Was part of”.

“Managed” rather than “was asked/recruited to manage”.

“A promotion to team leader was awarded to me after only six months of service,” is not as direct as the active form, “Was promoted to team leader after only six months.”

“Increased sales” or “Overhauled the department”.

Avoid the use of I/Me/He/She, everything should be in either the First or Third person whenever possible.

Example: “Managed a team of 20.” “Responsible for setting sales targets and establishing individual key performance indicators (KPIs).”

Mistake 11: CLICHÉS AND BUZZWORDS

Avoid using popular buzzwords:

‘Results oriented’, ‘Go getter’, ‘Creative’,

‘Innovative’, ‘energetic’, ‘driven’,

‘motivated’, ‘enthusiastic’, ‘hardworking’,

‘team-player’, ‘loyal’, ‘client-focussed’, ‘achievement-oriented’.

Who isn’t?

Everyone uses these words, how can you make your resume stand out?

Instead use: Powerful action verbs and examples, such as:

“Developed a new training software manual”

“Achieved all my sales targets”

“Managed a team of three”

“Initiated a health and safety program”

“Founded a new society at the University”

“Established new sales targets to help our company achieve a greater share of the market.”

Use — created, led, analyzed, automated, owned, styled,

and not — helped, assisted, worked, presented.

That’s more like it.

Mistake 12: NOT ‘ATS’ COMPATIBLE

Many large companies now use an automated Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to scan resumes and help them identify the most relevant ones.

To do this, an ATS looks for keywords that match the job description.

An organization is more likely to search for a specialist skill they want, rather than candidates who’ve described themselves as ‘enthusiastic’ or ‘hardworking’, using ATS.

Examples of Non-ATS Resume:

Do not use acronyms, as ATS software might not understand what that means, use Bachelor of Technology and not just B.Tech , or write both.

and not just , or write both. Random capitalizations, special characters, lack of consistency, stray blank spaces, abbreviations, and typos. This is bad.

So, make your resume ATS proof.

Mistake 13: PROJECT DESCRIPTION (CRITICAL)

Use STAR technique in resume and in answering questions-

Situation, Task, Action, and Result. Write the timeline, when you did that project. Write the impact of your project. Also state why you did a project you did, what was underlying motivation, if you do not include it, be ready with an answer during interviews. (Optional) If possible, include any test cases or how many test cases you wrote for a project/internship. Have % and numbers in projects, eg — accuracy was 76.15%. Or used 100,000 image samples to train an ML model. Improved performance by 13%. Reduced latency by 2ms/check. Also, include how you reduced latency and how you improved performance. Start your bullet points with powerful verbs. What you want them to talk about in an interview, put it to the top in your resume. Don’t put your job responsibilities, focus on what you have accomplished.

OR Follow this structure to describe your Internships Experience.

What was done?

What you did?

How you did it?

What you learnt?

What was the challenge?

Impacted users?

Should be like:

Grew email subscriber list from 80 to 200 in six months by implementing a new email format.

in six months by implementing a new email format. Reorganized storage of supplies, reducing time spent on inventory by 20% .

. Built a cost-effective face detection API model, which saved $250k+ dollars per year for the company by replacing a third party service used for face detection and blurring technique by using ensemble technique for building multiple ML models and achieved an accuracy of 92% with a less false positive rate of around 5%.

Should not be like:

“Implemented Pixel perfect image processing”

— It’s not quantifiable, write what makes something pixel perfect.

— It’s not quantifiable, write what makes something pixel perfect. Worked with NLP and research work related to image processing and model creation and proving support to other members.

— This is a vague and bad project description. Write what and how you did, not what a Machine Learning engineer generally does.

“Don’t just list your responsibilities by copying the Job description of the opening.”

Mistake 14: NO RESUME REVIEW

Ask friends, family, and peers to review your resume and give their honest feedback.

Don’t be shy stating that “But my resume is not worth showing anyone at this point” or “fear of judgment” because you’ll be judged anyway.

There are multiples online services that do free/paid resume feedback. Use those.

Mistake 15: FALSE INFORMATION

Do not claim way too much. Show honesty. They will figure it out eventually. Do not claim you are an expert at anything. Period. Do not lie. Nobody wins, everybody’s time gets wasted.

Also, don’t lie in your resume because it’s less comfortable than your bed ;)

You don’t need years of experience to get a tech job. Even if the job description calls for “1–2 years experience,” that’s usually flexible.

So how dyou get experience without a job?

Contribute to Open-Source projects. (Always always helps) Do freelance projects. Do volunteer projects or personal projects. Take part in hackathons and list them, you might get an internship out of it.

Mistake 16: VOLUNTEERING ACTIVITIES and ACHIEVEMENTS

You use your skills to give back to society.

One or two bullet points about volunteer experience speak to your character.

Do not explain why you did volunteering.

Do not list every activity you did at college or volunteered for.

Do not list every award or recognition you received to date.

Some Good Examples:

Volunteered at LIFT-OFF C, a month-long Program to teach C language and clear doubts of 200+ participants.

Hosted Eastern India’s Largest E-Summit Hackathon comprising of 113 teams.

Organized and tutored Git workshop, Python workshop and Ubuntu install fest to help bring the student community closer to the field of Open Source.

2nd Runners Up at Hack-A-Bit hackathon. Created a platform for live feedback from the audience through grouped emotion analysis.

Volunteered during summers for Habitat for Humanity and ABC Homeless Shelter.

Mistake 17: HOBBIES (Optional)

Hobbies people mention.

— dancer, reader, traveler, writer, etc are okay, but you can even optimize hobbies according to the job profile.

Mention targeted hobbies.

— finance profiles prefer candidates with poker skills.

— chess and meditation, will be appreciated by all.

— gymming, if the company is a fitness brand.

Some Tips:

Be exposed to reputable and relevant employers.

to reputable and relevant employers. Apply for jobs faster .

. Don’t be shy to talk about yourself. Be humble and brag about your achievements.

Always keep your resume updated with your skills.

Put links at the top or side, but not the bottom.

If student , education, and projects at the top.

, education, and projects at the top. If experienced , experience and skills at the top.

, experience and skills at the top. A 1-page highly targeted resume is enough to get you your dream job.

Employers care about your experience more than education.

Internships are more prioritized than Projects.

Certification and Coursework are good for beginners to have in resumes. Awards and Volunteering too, but keep them short. But other useless certifications dilute your resume.

Hobbies, personal interests, and Extracurricular are not needed for a strict technical position. These hobbies might help if you’re applying to startups. Startups want a mixed profile.

Mention your individual contribution/accomplishment first, then what you did as a team.

Some HRs look for useless things on your resume to judge you and then they look into the real matter.

You may even work on good projects just for the sake to put them on your resume.

An expert once said,

“ Hey, here is what I have done, here is what I can show you, let’s meet and I will be respectful of your time, if this is useful to you.“ This should be the format of you calling out busy people. Do not be vague in your talks. They want to see the product progress. That’s your resume. Proof of work. ~ Naval Ravikant

How to highlight your strengths in a resume. Hint: use evidence.,"Have you ever googled how to write a resume, and found beautifully written phrases that sound so impactful…it’s just using them verbatim, feels…kind of…unauthentic…you wonder if everyone’s resume looks like this and if yours will even stand out.

Photo by Zoltan Tasi on Unsplash

I’ll be honest with you, having a resume filled with well-crafted sentences that you didn’t write and have no substance behind them, will NOT catch the attention of your future employer. Using only a combination of buzzwords is not an effective way to get shortlisted for an interview.

It is not the use of buzzwords per se that is the problem, it is using them without supporting evidence (your experiences). The following task will guide you in re-creating an impactful skill statement that is personalized by you, for you and about you. Cool?

But I don’t have any good experiences…

First get a pen and paper, keyboard, typewriter, whichever you feel most comfortable using (I often start by writing, and once my ideas start to take shape, I transition to typing).

Start by answering the below questions. This exercise will take some time and dedicated thought. However, it is well worth it. I continue to use this process to update my resumes. The aim is to dissect your experiences to uncover your capabilities. Employers want insights into your behaviours, and behaviours are just buzzwords without the work experience evidence.

The more specific you are with the below, the more unique and personalized your skill statements will be.",https://medium.com/@careercalling/develop-your-own-skill-statements-for-a-resume-with-impact-622e4e4888de,['All About Success'],2022-01-26 01:02:30.497000+00:00,"['Cover Letter', 'Careers', 'Professional', 'Hiring', 'Resume']"
“Don’t be one of those People”,"The Power of the Pre-Emptive Public Shaming

www.cnn.com

My dad used to say “Everything you do is a reflection on me. So don’t embarrass me”. He was one for straightforward messaging. He didn’t say this all the time, he didn’t have to. The message he was trying to impart on a young mind was clear. You are not alone here, so f******g behave yourself. He would remind me of this occasionally, but it was always imparted before going to the airport.

Kids behave the way they do on airplanes (and other places) because they are kids. I’d argue that their behaviours and those of their beleaguered parents in terms of guiding them have changed over the years but I’ll save that for another article.

But what is going on with the adults around them? Grown people behave badly in public when they think that they have righteous impunity (and even when they don’t) and that there won’t be any consequences for their idiocy. We don’t have to look all that hard for example, either online or by witnessing it ourselves. And let’s be honest, haven’t we all wanted to speak to the manager at some point and only barely kept ourselves together?

Yeah, people are stupid and yeah, many of them have been on airplanes in the past year since Covid restrictions lifted. My guess is that they have always been among us, but the camera eye has been a recent addition to the mix in the last decade. We all know it’s there and maybe it has helped keep us in line. And yet somehow, despite the almost certain guarantee of being filmed, instances of people completely losing it has not stopped or even lessened. In fact, one could argue that it has increased. And as we all know by now, there is indeed such a thing as bad publicity.

There are clearly plenty of people for whom making a scene so that they get their way or at least get their frustrations and anger out has worked well for them in the past. But what do we do with those people who are already so tightly wound and then snap when they are pushed, such that they won’t comply with restrictions and feel that it is their duty to stand up for their perceived rights and the rights of others, thereby creating delays, elevating tensions, causing discomfort and general mayhem and a generally toxic atmosphere for all on board?

American Airlines, at least, has decided not to shy away from the issue. A few days ago, I flew from Kingston, Jamaica to Miami and then from there to San Juan, Puerto Rico. On both flights, in the captain’s pre flight announcements, he made it a point to address the issue. “We are all aware from social media of examples of people behaving badly and not following cabin crew instructions. It makes things difficult for members of staff and your fellow travelers when this happens. Most likely, you will end up on social media. Please do not be one of those people.”

The bolding and italics are mine. He actually said those words. The problem exists, so let’s dispense with the niceties and get ahead of it before it happens.

As a non-American, the prospect of traveling through the US comes with no small amount of trepidation and anxiety, given the procedures, lengthy line ups and glaring border control agents one will have to endure. This announcement came as a relief. The flight was calm. There were still people who couldn’t seem to figure out how to find their seat or how to fit their giant luggage in the overhead bin. There will always be those people. But aside from that, there were no stupid people behaving stupidly.

A modern day pre-emptive public shaming. It could be the way forward for us all. A quick reminder that you are not alone, a notice that you are responsible as a grown adult for your actions and that your actions have consequences. My dad, if he had had any idea of social media, would have probably posted a photo of him clapping for this. Except that he wouldn’t have wanted to cause a scene.",https://medium.com/@73srabt/dont-be-one-of-those-people-cba567ed7f1b,['Scott-Ryan Abt'],2022-01-09 20:05:21.455000+00:00,"['Travel', 'Public Shaming', 'Behaving Badly', 'Airlines']"
How Much is Fare Scraping Costing the Travel Industry?,"Scraper bots make up the worst of bad bot traffic for the travel industry, with sites witnessing over 90% of traffic attributed to fare scraping. Whilst this activity can be benign or even used for positive means, if uncontrolled it can impact top line revenue, bottom line profits and customer experience.

In a recent webinar, Netacea’s Head of Threat Research, Matthew Gracey-McMinn, and Enterprise Sales Manager for Travel and Tourism, Graeme Harvey, were joined by Ann Cederhall, Travel Technology Specialist at LeapShift.

The panel discussed the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the travel and tourism industry, the damage of fare scraping and excess web requests on travel booking sites, and how travel companies can take back control of their look-to-book ratio.

Catch up on all the key takeaways below or watch the full webinar on demand here.

What is the look-to-book ratio?

The look-to-book ratio is the number of requests made per booking on an online travel site.

Requests can be made by humans or bots, and the lower the look-to-book ratio, the better. A low look-to-book ratio means conversions are high from genuine customers browsing the website. However, scraper activity can cause look-to-book ratios to exceed several thousand. A high look-to-book ratio inflates the number of requests versus the number of conversions.

When scraper bots pull information from a website, they create excess web requests which, in turn, negatively impacts your look-to-book ratio. Increased competition driven from the pandemic, and the popularity of dynamic pricing, means this is fast becoming a top threat for the travel industry.

How does fare scraping work on travel booking websites?

In travel, web scraper bots are mainly used to collect fare and availability information by rival companies and aggregator sites, used for price comparison.

But also targeting travel booking sites are scraper bots, used to discover and publicize the availability of products and services such as flights, hotels or car rentals.

Attackers advertise the scraped information at lower price points on a secondary site, motivated by the financial reward of charging commission, stealing personal data, or generating advertising revenue.

Scraping is also often used to gather the data needed for more sophisticated or damaging attacks such as ticket spinning or denial of inventory. Preventing malicious scraper bots can cut out these further attacks early as the attackers do not have the data they need to progress.

‘The attackers who were working in travel have moved out of the space over the last year, but they are now coming back with new skills and techniques learned from other industries [during the Covid-19 pandemic].’ – Matthew Gracey-McMinn, Head of Threat Research at Netacea

What damage is inflated look-to-book ratios causing to travel companies?

‘The cost for an airline of having excess transactions — of having pricing systems being queried — can be very substantial, and also uncontrollable.’ – Ann Cederhall, Travel Technology Specialist at LeapShift

Excess traffic caused by aggressive scraping and high look-to-book ratios negatively impact airlines and travel companies both on their bottom line and on their technical performance.

Business costs

Additional costs (up to millions per year) to third-party services like Metasearch engines and GDS booking fees, which charge based on traffic volumes

Extra costs for SIEM and anti-fraud solutions, again which charge based on traffic volumes

Loss of pricing visibility leading to competitive pricing disadvantage

Misleading analytics from inaccurate number of website viewers interested in a certain product

Loss of ancillary revenues (or “add-ons”) e.g., hotels, travel insurance and car hire

Technical costs

Excessive infrastructure costs (up to 50%) used to serve bots

IT teams stretched to deal with bots away from daily tasks

Slowed website performance leading to negative user experience

Costly downtime in extreme cases

How to prevent scraping, excess transactions and high look-to-book ratios

The travel industry is one of the most severely affected by bad bots and has been since the advent of online travel. As bots grow in sophistication and volume, it is crucial for travel websites to accurately detect and bad bots without affecting good bots necessary for the steady running of your website, and genuine users’ experience.

As Ann Cederhall concluded in the webinar:

‘It’s all about control.’

What is a Veneer?,"Veneers are one possible solution to help you achieve the look you want. They are a popular choice for people with broken teeth, tooth gaps, or malformed teeth.

Dental Veneer is a thin cover that adheres to teeth and gives a classic shape look. You can choose from a variety of tooth veneer options. Talk to your dentist about what works best for you.

Dental Veneer

If you want to enhance your smile, a veneer is an easy option. A veneer is a thin cover that is placed on the front (visible) part of the tooth. They look like natural teeth. Veneers can be used to fix a variety of dental problems, including:

1)Teeth that discolor and cannot be brightened by bleaching

2) Missing or worn teeth

3) Bent or deformed teeth

4) Non-uniform space or a large gap between upper anterior teeth Veneer is made of either porcelain or composite material. Your dentist will help you choose the material that is most suitable for you. Each type of veneer has its advantages.

Porcelain Veneer

Porcelain veneers are thin shells that are individually adapted to the teeth.

Advantages of porcelain veneer:

1) Durable and durable

2) It has a natural finish

3) Less enamel needs to be removed than crowns and caps

4) Stain-resistant

Porcelain veneer application procedure:

To prepare the teeth, the dentist usually removes a small amount of enamel from the front and sides of the teeth. This gives the veneer space to make the teeth look natural

The dentist makes the impression and shape of the prepared teeth. The dentist will also determine the best veneer shade for your smile.

Impressions are sent to the dental laboratory, which adapts the porcelain veneer to the individual teeth. This may take several days. In the meantime, the dentist can have you wear a temporary veneer.

On your next visit, the dentist will place the veneer on your teeth to check the fit and shape. After adjustment, clean the teeth and glue the veneer to the teeth.

Further changes are possible at a later date.

Composite Resin veneer

Composite veneers are made up of tooth-colored fillers that are glued to the teeth. Advantages of composite veneers:

Usually, less enamel needs to be removed than crowns and ceramic veneers.

Fewer visits to the dentist-these veneers may only need one visit.

Cheaper than Chinese veneer.

Easy to repair if damaged.

Composite veneers are generally not as strong and wear-resistant as ceramic veneers, but composite veneers are easy and quick to repair.

Steps to place composite resin veneers:

1) After the teeth are prepared or reshaped, the dentist carefully bonds and sculpts the composite material using a color that is best for you.

2) A special light is used to harden the composite and bond it to your teeth.

3) The veneers are smoothed and polished to look like natural teeth.",https://medium.com/@chatsworthdentalgroup/what-is-a-veneer-402af113035e,['Chatsworthdental Group'],2022-01-04 12:38:05.134000+00:00,"['Dentistry', 'Dental Care', 'Dentist', 'Dental Veneers', 'Dental Implants']"
Niftyx Protocol: product pipeline and rollout strategy,"Hi Shroomies! As we wrap up this year we’d like to shed some light on what’s coming in early 2022 with our rollout plan, and also show additional sneak peeks of work we’ve done internally.

This past year has been one of transitions, introspection, waiting, planning, and finally all pieces are falling into place. We’ve gone from targeting indie games to doubling-down on AAA-quality titles. From being a pixelated meme to adopting a better brand ready for the mainstream. We have learned that quality takes time, and accepted trade-offs that allow us to not compromise or give up our vision of an open, neutral and community-driven Metaverse.

Just some growing pains! And we did everything to ensure that we end up with a future-proof project. So, here’s what to expect as we enter the new year and in what order…

What to expect — Timeline of Events

Current timeline of events as per best effort estimates

Each of the timeline items will come with a dedicated post in the coming days and weeks, so we will simply go over the overall strategy. There are more items but the general action plan for the first months of the year could be summarised in 3 simple stages.

Liquidity Improvements → Subnet setup → DEX and Game launch

This doesn’t mean that advances for each of these work streams won’t happen in parallel. We have a lot of stuff being cooked in the kitchen at the same time!

SHROOM migration and Liquidity Program.

Drawing inspiration from new algorithmic reserve currencies, we will borrow some of their innovations and apply them to our ecosystem, which already has a compelling use case as NFT trading layer.

Having protocol owned liquidity has undeniable benefits and will ultimately help us solve liquidity issues and slowly build a treasury of risk-free + ecosystem assets that can be deployed to further boost the growth of our protocols.

In the next post we will be announcing the migration plan and the new incentives to attract liquidity as well as honouring the pending rewards as soon as the new GSWAP token is issued in our upcoming subnet.

Gaming Subnet setup

Avalanche Subnets should be feature-complete during Q1, and as you know this is a moment that we’ve been waiting for over a year. Cross-subnet transfer will be the final critical feature that will allow teams to build with confidence without fears of their ecosystems being isolated.

During the Gameswap subnet bootstrapping the new GSWAP token will be issued with renewed tokenomics that we will explain in an upcoming update. The main change will be the introduction of a small inflationary process. Of course the community will need to approve any tokenomic changes.

We remain positive our Subnet will be operational at some point during Q1.

Gameswap DEX release

Following the Subnet launch focus will switch to the Gameswap DEX release, first for beta testers and then for the general public. NFT trading and protocol rewards via staking will be available from the get go.

New staking section

We have been adding additional views such as integrated bridge in the UI, Staking/Farming views, and many more that will be functional on launch day.

A superior bridging experience will help Gameswap attract liquidity to/from other chains

AAA Game dropping during first half of the year!

A lot has been talked about “the game”, and it almost seems like it’s the only topic, but we can’t stress how important it will be for the ecosystem so obviously we should all be very excited.

Not only will it be setting the bar for the quality of the assets that we expect to host on Gameswap, it will also introduce the NFT technology standards that future games will need to adopt there.

The game world is primarily set in an ‘Accretion Class’ asteroid, at geosynchronous orbit in 2126

Gameswap will be betting on new technology and it will be a requirement for listed games to integrate using it. The goal is to progressively build a AAA Metaverse, where true migration of assets from game to game is achieved flawlessly via standard primitives for trading, VFX and SFX.

The development for this game system is designed to be available as a basis for this Metaverse building process, a building block that can help the community build an open system moving forward.

Early Artwork (Q2'2021) of in-game AI (albeit a hacked AI from the Exomarts)

Weapons and characters in the game are expanded by an AI system which adds an extra dimension to the NFT collections, this is along with a number of other features that add a variety of new gameplay experiences are being kept mostly under wraps for now but will be revealed along with the game itself. Achieving composable NFTs across games will unlock new gaming experiences, this is part of a larger system that is built on a standard designed to be beneficial to both players and developers.

There are more than 30 types of weapons and other equipment being built with unparalleled details and most are ready now

The emphasis in this game world is about creating engaging stories with great characters and new, interesting gameplay.. Real quality of immersion is key, blurring the line between the real world and the game world is where the most fun lies.

We have been low-key leaking some details about what’s being built, and who is building it… so there are many reasons to be excited about the 1st upcoming trailer and game reveal in January. And obviously for the playable alpha launch during late Q1'2022 with priority access for the Niftyx community! 🎉

Next steps

The next update will cover details about the SHROOM migration after we discuss and nail down some details with the community.

We don’t want to steal more time from your NYE celebrations. So with this update we want to say thank you for being there supporting us all these past months and we want to give you reasons to believe that 2022 will be a great year for our ecosystem!

Happy Pew Year!!!

Valorant impact value: giving credit where credit is due,"It is indisputable that current Valorant stats are shallow, totally duelist-oriented and do not reflect the true impact of certain actions within the match. Let’s say you are playing Split defense and you guys just won the pistol round against attackers. On the second round, some of your hungry team mates randomly decides to overextend mid and he ends up taking multiple gunfights at once. Roughly speaking: can it be an impactful play? Let’s dive into it

Outcome A: he gets 3 kills and falls back into cover

Outcome B: he gets the same 3 kills, but dies and gives his Spectre to his enemies

Outcome C: he does not get a single kill, dies and and gives his Spectre to his enemies

Combinatorily speaking, going for multiple gunfights at once is a task classified as high risk (there is a chance of gifting your spectre to enemies) low reward (regardless of what you do, your team should always be winning that round). That being said, the duty of winning the round is never in the shoulders of the team that lost the pistol. Because of this, each kill the attackers get brings way more value to the table than each kill the defenders get.

That theory sounds cool on paper, but does it really works like that on real matches? Let’s look at one example and see if things goes as we expected :)

Round example here

Defense win probability at round 2

Impact table on round 2

As we can see in the table, defender kills (and multi-kills) increases little to nothing the chances of defenders winning an already favourable round, while any kill the attacker team gets flips the odds by a huge margin.

Although both MkaeL and dapr got 3 kills, just one of them was supposed to win that round, the other was not. This leads to a 109.99 delta impact for MkaeL and only -0.34 for dapr. Cool, no?

Let’s take a look at how ACS treated the same situation

As you probably already expected, ACS treated both situations as if they were equally impactful, which is far away from being true. I mean, what ACS fails to achieve is capturing the nuances of each situation. Not every multi-kill is the same. Not every gunfight tells the same story. Not every round has the same odds.

What if you got a multi-kill while holding your operator on an empty bombsite? According to ACS you have done one of the best plays you could do to your team. But at the end of the day you did not impact the odds of winning that round, since the bomb was already going to explode with or without your flashy multi-kill.

By saying this i’m not trying to bash on that metric and I totally understand that Riot wanted to have at least a placeholder. After all, having a score system is better than having no score system, isn’t?

Who knows in the future we can have keep improving on this and implement better metrics for non-duelist agents? Let’s give Caesar what belongs to Caesar :)

Final impact table of that icebox match

Final scoreboard

Final scoreboard above. We all know sage players have a hard time on Icebox. Look at how SicK went from bottom to 2nd place, climbing up +3 positions! As much as he had the worst KDA in the whole team (11/14), his 11 kills were impactful. After all, that is what should matter in a Valorant match.

Getting the rounds where at a given moment the minimum probability of winning a round was low but that team ended up winning it anyway. Let’s look at round 6",https://medium.com/@matbessa12/valorant-impact-value-giving-credit-where-credit-is-due-d2b4ca66f03d,[],2022-01-06 02:10:40.066000+00:00,"['Predictions', 'Esport', 'Fps', 'Data Science', 'Valorant']"
"Tips For Better Abdominal Health: Vijaya, Ayurveda & More","Abdominal health is the cornerstone of the body to function optimally since the abdomen is the region that contains the body’s digestive organs. And today, a vast majority of digestive issues and abdominal health conditions are because of improper habits and accumulation and rotting of undigested food, causing conditions like

Diarrhea

Constipation

Ulcers

IBS, IBD, etc.

To improve your abdominal health and prevent such issues, Ayurveda doctors recommend certain dietary and lifestyle changes along with the consumption of the potent herb Vijaya.

Because Vijaya shows robust anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties that help in effectively alleviating digestive disorders and their symptoms in patients and improving their overall quality of life.

Some tips for better abdominal health are as follows:

Eat Fresh Foods

Ayurveda doctors recommend including more fresh veggies and fruits in your diet. They provide the body with the necessary nutrients to improve gut health and digestion.

There are some carbohydrates that the body cannot digest and absorb easily. And undigested carbohydrates, when rotten, can cause excessive bacterial growth, abdominal pain, and gas. Adopting a low-FODMAP diet and getting the best medical consultation to know which foods will suit you the best help manage digestive issues.

Avoid Processed Foods

Processed foods are rich in:

Artificial sweeteners

Food additives

Refined carbohydrates

Trans fats

They can cause much damage to the digestive tract by producing harmful chemicals. Hence replacing them with whole foods (whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables) instead enhances digestive health.

Furthermore, reduce consumption of fatty foods, dairy products with high-fat foods like butter and cheese, and white foods such as rice, potatoes, and white bread. These foods slow down the digestive processes.

Add More Fiber to Your Diet

Choosing whole grains over processed ones and opting for more fruits, veggies, and legumes can help you significantly improve your abdominal health. Fibers help keep the food moving through the digestive tract and alleviate conditions like constipation, diarrhea, ulcers, and IBS.

It is crucial to consume both kinds of fibers, insoluble (roughage) and soluble. The former adds bulk to the stools, and the latter absorbs water to prevent watery stools.

Consume More Pre and Probiotics

Probiotics are yeasts and healthy bacteria in the digestive tract that help combat the symptoms of stress, constipation, diarrhea, bloating, gas, and even IBS pain in people. Fermented foods are good probiotic sources that help with better nutrient digestion and absorption, like kefir, kimchee, low-fat yogurt, fermented vegetables, etc.

And prebiotics are the compounds in foods that aid the growth of these healthy gut bacteria. Some common prebiotic sources include whole grains, raw fruits, and veggies, legumes, etc.

Check Your Medications and Choose Vijaya

There are numerous prescription drugs, antibiotics, and OTC medicines for digestive issues that interfere with gut bacteria, cause harmful side effects to the system and worsen the conditions. Hence, it is best to talk to your doctors, get the best medical consultation.

Choose suitable alternatives such as Vijaya, which can help relieve several digestive problems. There is a reason why, for centuries, this herb has been used medicinally to treat digestive disorders. When people consume Vijaya, it goes into the system and binds with the cannabinoid receptors in the gut.

By doing so it activates those receptors which in turn helps enhance food intake and improve digestion. Furthermore, Vijaya significantly reduces acid secretion that is caused by increased junk food consumption today.

Not only that, because of its direct influence on the digestive system, Vijaya is very helpful in managing disorders like IBS, IBD, Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn’s Disease, etc. Patients report significant decreases in their symptoms such as abdominal pain and daily bowel movements.

Besides that, Vijaya also reduces people’s dependence on traditional prescription drugs, especially harmful and addictive opioids. What makes this herb even better is that it exhibits all these health benefits without showing any adverse side effects on health that are shown by conventional medications.

Adopt the Right Eating Habits

To improve abdominal health, it is crucial to eat the right foods the right way by adopting the following habits:

Have a fixed, regular schedule for meals to keep the digestive system healthy.

Replace frying and grilling with healthier cooking methods like steaming, stewing, microwaving, boiling, etc.

Have a sufficient gap between meals and sleep to aid digestion.

Avoid excess sweet, salty, and spicy foods.

Avoid consuming spoilt foods.

Avoid smoking, drinking alcohol, and consuming caffeinated beverages.

Don’t eat too much too quickly.

Eat the amounts your body needs, not what the taste-buds desire.

Eat slowly and chew the food properly instead of gulping. It helps properly break down the food, produce enough saliva for digestion, and digest and absorb the nutrients better.

Stay Hydrated

Drinking sufficient water is crucial for good digestive health. It helps the body break down the food and absorb the nutrients better. It further softens the stool and allows it to pass more easily through the colon, hence alleviating the chances of constipation.

Reduce Stress

Annoying deadlines and hectic workflows have caused a lot of stress in people, which has impacted digestion and caused various abdominal issues in people. Stress-reducing activities like meditation, yoga, exercise, good sleep, creative hobbies, etc., go a long way in coping with stress and keeping the abdomen healthy.

Exercise Regularly

Regular exercise helps the food move properly in the digestive tract, reduce constipation, reduce excess weight, alleviate stress, and keep you active. Hence ensure including regular exercise in your schedule after a healthy meal.

Get Sufficient Sleep

Lack of sleep can disturb the hormonal balance, causing stress and affecting your dietary choices and appetite. When tired, you might resort to fast foods to get immediate energy boosts and cause long-term damage to the system. Hence, it is important to get at least 7 hours or more sleep in a day.

"Cyprus: Land of love, invasions, and our first Levantine treats","Amazing book a”meh”zing wine

Armchair travelling to every country in the world is not my only grand gesture of love for our planet. The first was promising the children that I would take them to every country in Europe. We had hit country 39 (Poland) when Covid turned our travels virtual. And the very first country we visited on those real travels was Cyprus, an unforgettable, sunny island that is so well placed it has been conquered by Hittites, Egyptians, Phoenicians, Assyrians, Greeks, Persians, Macedonians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Franks, Genoese, Venetians, Ottomans, Turks and British armies. The last time was in 1974, when Greek nationalists staged a coup d’etat and the Turkish retaliated by invading the North, thereby separating this island in two with a “thin green line” between them.

This traumatic period is at the heart of this week’s novel “The Island of Missing Trees” by Elif Shafak, the perfect book to go armchair travelling with. Not only does Shafak weave history into the storytelling, she also teases the tastebuds with evocative descriptions of the food and drinks that would accompany any real trip to Cyprus. It is pretty cheese and honey heavy and so we fell off the vegan wagon for this one, but as this is our first Levantine country, there is plenty of vegan food too. I tried to cook as much as possible, but couldn’t do as well as Ada’s (the main character) aunt who fixed breakfast of “grilled halloumi with za’atar, baked feta with honey, sesame halva, stuffed tomatoes, green olives with fennel, bread rolls with black olive spread…” it goes on… for ages.

Vegan version of Levantine spread

The novel is part-narrated by a Fig Tree, but don’t let that put you off, it is readable and accessible and borrows heavily from the Hidden Life of Trees, and Gods Wasps and Stranglers, two of the best tree books I’ve ever read.

Veggie version of Levantine spread

Whilst revelling in Shafak’s words, I gorged on honey roasted figs, honey baked feta, Greek salad, Makaoronia Tou Fournou (a Cypriot pasta bake), and anything from the Levant that I could find in the supermarket. It was easy to cook and the only complaints were that there wasn’t enough of it. This was one of those countries where you could eat a different dish every day of the armchair travelling week and still not get through the recipes.

Figs baked in honey topped with pomegranate molasses, pistachio and vegan ice-cream

But what do you wash it down with? Well, having visited five different shops looking for Greek wine, I finally found a shop that sells Cypriot wine from Keo, a brewery which seems to have a monopoly on Cypriot booze. It even owns St John Commondaria, which has been brewed the same way since the 8th Century. The only problem is that winemaking has got far, far better since then and so I am not a fan of this sweet, sweet wine, nor, if I’m honest, the Othello wine that we drank with our meal (though it got better after a few glasses!) Keo beer though, THAT I got on well with, though I guess it is similar to good quality lager the world over.

Greek Cypriot food, kinda

For our film we retuned to the 1974 war with “The boy on the bridge”, which tells the story of traumas passed on to generations, coming of age in a small Cypriot village and life growing up in the 1980s. Despite the subject matter, it is slow, relaxing, and like spending a couple of hours experiencing village life. There are twists, there are turns, there is a parrot (just as there is in The Island of Missing Trees) and there are no mobile phones. What more could anyone ask for?

The world is a wonderful place

Cyprus is also the home of Aphrodite, the Goddess of love, beauty and sexuality so you would have thought that it would also be an island of love songs, and maybe it is, it is hard to tell what they are singing about in the excellent Music of Cyprus: it could be love, or God, or death, or war, or losing their favourite jumper in a nightclub, but it is certainly emotive and I should maybe had started by recommending that you listen to it whilst you read the blog, which is now done, until next week, when we visit Czechia!",https://medium.com/@armchairtraveller/cyprus-land-of-love-invasions-and-our-first-levantine-treats-52143153c508,['Armchair Traveller'],2022-01-07 11:22:06.038000+00:00,"['Aphrodite', 'World Travel', 'Wine', 'Armchair Travel', 'Cyprus']"

World of Warcraft is a meta-universe chain game with the theme of Play to earn. It adds the model and story elements of “World of Wracraft”, supports PVE tower defense mission mode and PVP player battle mode, and adds level system, Rune system, guild reward system, players can obtain corresponding game token rewards by exploring all aspects of the game.

In the game, players can summon three heroes: Terran, Orc and night elf. Humans produce meat (WWF), beasts produce wood (WWW), and night elves produce gold (WWG).

Players to participate in the game first select the PVE level, and then select the heroes to fight. After passing the level, the corresponding token rewards can be obtained. The rewards are determined by the hero’s attribute and level, the level’s income coefficient, and the rune bonus coefficient.

For example, if you play a wood hero, you will get WWW token rewards corresponding to the wood hero when you clear the game.

For example, if you play a meat hero and a wood hero, you will get WWF and

WWW token rewards corresponding to the meat hero and wood hero.

The attributes of the heroes chosen to fight are different, and the reward

tokens obtained through PVE missions are also different.

Referral Sharing Mechanism,"Conditions for referrers:

Anyone with an invitation link can become a referrer. If a referrer has at least one NFT in his/her account, the referrer will have a share of the referral earning.

The bond between referrer and referee is valid for a period of 30 days (during this period if the referrer’s account has less than one NFT, no earning from referrals will be given but the bond between the referrer and referee will remain valid).

Referral earnings are as described below:

When a referee buys a mystery box in the marketplace using SEA tokens, 5.75% of the total transaction amount, as well as 7% of the platform fee (4.25%) charged by the platform, will be given to the referrer.

For example: If a referee spends 1500 SEA to purchase three mystery boxes, then his/her referrer can get: 1500*5.75%+1500*4.25%*7%=90.7125 $SEA

2. When a referee makes purchases via C2C, 7% of the platform fee (4.25%) charged by the platform will be given to the referrer.

For example: If a referee made purchases via C2C in the total amount of 3 BNB, then his/her referrer can get: 3*4.25%*7%=0.008925 BNB

3. A referee will contribute promotion points to their referrer for all purchases made in the marketplace. The top 500 referrers ranked by the total number of promotion points during the season will be rewarded a referrer bonus.

Platform fee includes purchase shark NFTs through using $SEA on StarSharks official website and the C2C transactions on marketplace all at a rate of 4.25%, of which the distribution is outlined below;

1% allocated for agency rewards, 2% allocated for guild rewards. 7% allocated for referral earning which will remain valid for 30 days; upon expiry, SEA will be burned and BNB will be put into the staking pool. 70% will be allocated to the staking pool. 20% will be allocated as the platform’s revenue.

Noted: When the referrer/agency/guild does not meet the referral conditions, SEA will be burned and BNB will be put into the staking pool.

Breakdown of the distribution of SEA earnings:

a. 90% Burned;

b. 5.75% Referrer;

c. 4.25% Platform fee:

20% goes to the platform revenue

3% goes to the guild

7% goes to the referrer

70% is burned

Breakdown of the distribution of SEA earnings for the first season without referrals.

500 SEA -

500*4.25%*20%=4.25 SEA to the platform revenue

495.75 Burned

All $SEA Token earnings for referrers will be calculated at the end of the month. Because there was no affiliation in December, the relevant $SEA are burned. The earning from referrals will start in January.

E-sports on the rise; youth sports suffer,"As the sports world is once again colliding with Covid-19, thanks to the Omicron variant, I could not help but notice a recent story in the NY Times’ sports section. It dealt with the rise in E-sports and focused on a family in Texas. E-sports is growing in popularity, helped by the pandemic, when sports activities were curtailed and youth turned to other interests.

The piece is particularly interesting because the parents of the two boys who were the main subjects in the story, did not want their kids playing football. Mind you, this is in football-mad Texas, where the high school football season just ended this past weekend. The parents felt football was too dangerous.

As the story mentioned, youth participation in sports was dropping before the pandemic. The decline has accelerated, as the pandemic continues. This quote by Dr. Travis E. Dorsch, associate professor and founding director of the Families in Sport Lab at Utah State University, is especially telling:

“There is a lot more stuff competing for the attention of young people — E-sports is a big one. As kids get older, there is more tug at them academically and socially. We’re seeing a lot of dropouts. This creates a reckoning for youth sports.”

No question youth sports is at a crossroads. As kids become more adept at playing E-sports, where being all thumbs can be a plus rather than a curse, organizers of youth sports are more concerned they may become part of a bygone era. Professional sports leagues and collegiate sports are also watching the trend.

The University of Michigan, where football is king, is offering scholarships to E-sports participants. An expert in E-Sports can compete for millions in prize money. The possibilities are endless.

The day may come when more people are watching an E-Sports event on You Tube, Twitch or television than the World Series. Think I’m kidding? Many E-sports channels on You Tube consistently draw hundreds of thousands of views. It is safe to say E-sports is more than a fad. In fact, it has the lasting power of a new generation, prepared to relegate the sports landscape on which older generations were weened to the sidelines.",https://medium.com/@danlovallotalk/e-sports-on-the-rise-youth-sports-suffer-689e1a3be052,['Dan Lovallo'],2022-02-01 02:05:30.030000+00:00,"['Sports', 'Esports', 'Youth']"
Let’s Look at December 14,"America has entered a time when major news agencies will divulge only what they want to divulge. It must fit their narrative, or they simply cannot report on it.

December 14th has a major significance because it is the day that the COVID vaccines were distributed and given for the first time to patients. COVID had dominated the airways for the last 9 months. It was the number topic of all news agencies. December 14th was also the day that my wife and I were traveling up to Kansas from Texas to see our two sons that lived up there. It was our only chance to see our oldest son as we were not going to see him for Christmas.

So, as we drive up to Kansas, somewhere at the top of Oklahoma, the wife and I switch out driving. That is the time I get to see what the internet has to tell me. You know, what the news agencies want me to know. At least once a day I do venture over to CNN, to view what they call news. Of course, they did not let my expectation down whatsoever. It was around 3 pm, and the top 5 stories that CNN thought were the most important for the day for all viewers to read about surprised me. For nowhere in the top 5 stories was a word about COVID vaccine distribution. I was completely dumbfounded, in fact I screened shot each story in disbelief.

The top story that was important for all America to drop everything to read was titled, “Congressman leaves GOP, blasts Trump and party leaders.” Now as I read this, regardless of which party switched to what, this happens in every Presidency, this to be honest on the grand scheme of things, is at best, this is a story that is in lower portion of the top 20 stories of the day. If CNN, were a paper it would be right before the classified ads. But CNN felt it was the most important, ok maybe they put COVID vaccine distribution as number two. You know a vaccine that was produced in less than a year and will get out to all of America. Not a chance.

The second top story from CNN on the day COVID-19 vaccine was released was titled, “COVID-19 now kills more than 1 American every minute. And the rate keeps accelerating.” Now that does hint on COVID-19 but is not about the vaccine instead it is showing some data to produce fear amongst its viewers. You know a technique that says, “stay tuned to us because only CNN can scare the heck out of you.”

The third most important story from CNN on December 14 thwas, “Gupta pressures Azar on White House parties: How are we supposed to reconcile this?” Really, if this were a paper it would be back in the “for sale” section of the paper. This is really, more important than the monumental feat of developing a vaccine, going through trial and error, getting it to pass the FDA, and then distributing it throughout the United States properly. Yep, deep down in my heart, I really wanted to know all about this article. An article that gave a futile attempt to paint the White House in less light instead of taking the opportunity to inform America.

The fourth most important story from CNN is “LIVE Updates: America’s electors cast their votes.” Then it has a photo of the Clintons casting. Like they have any relevance left. I do not mind the LIVE update of this due to the election just recently happened but not sure why a photo of the Clinton’s would be put on there. Do not get me wrong, Bill was the 42 ndPresident. Ok I got that. Hillary was just another person that did not become President, plain and simple. No relevance here, except she finally gets a little good feeling payback in 2020 after not getting over losing the election in 2016 to an amateur politician, for the last four years. I am waiting for her memoirs to be released in 2030 called, “I’m still not over 2016 by HRC.”

Then we have the fifth most important story from CNN, “Why the Electoral College has long been controversial?” This is a story that runs after every election. In a paper it would be a prelude to the classified section. But CNN ordained it to be the fifth most important story in America, way above the fact that the COVID vaccine was already being distributed and administered earlier this day.

Just to demonstrate that news must fit an agenda, I’ll even cover their sixth most important story of the day. This story, “even after getting a COVID vaccine, you should still wear a mask. Here’s why-and for how long?” Yep, hey you guys, we still got to make sure we show we are controlling you, so let us push an article saying that you still got to wear a mask. Got to keep the mask making business going. More importantly CNN felt the need to taint the confidence in people taking the vaccine. You know, make sure you wear that mask, you never know.

So, this is my thoughts and other thoughts may vary but I would suggest that CNN is a little lopsided in their reporting. Basically, it is more important for CNN to feed you their agenda instead of simply reporting the news. You remember when that is what news agencies did. Today our expectation is still the same, just CNN does not meet our expectation.

I am just asking the viewer of CNN, “Doesn’t America Deserve Better” reporting, just simply asking for America????????",https://thecoachandthevet.com/lets-look-at-december-14-dcf39f665cb2,['Ian Griffin'],2022-02-01 03:16:40.809000+00:00,"['Doesnt America Deserve', 'Headlines', 'Narrative', 'News', 'Cnn']"

Hackers’ theft of confidential data is a significant threat to businesses worldwide, including the hotel industry, without a doubt. Hoteliers stay powerless to hackers aiming to sensitive and confidential data such as guests’ credit card information and employees’ private details. During a hotel breach, hackers followed a ransom payment after assuming the hotel’s technology instead of pursuing personal data.

During a conference, there was a discussion on how cybersecurity affects the industry. One significant thing indicated that hotels should look at hackers’ physical damage potential. Potential targets can be guest data systems and life and safety systems such as HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning), elevators, electricity, and the like. Financial theft affects property and stature, but a breach of its physical arrangement could also cause it to shut down.

A discussion then turned to a European property that had its systems frozen by hackers resulting in its complete hotel computer shutdown. It suffered two cyberattacks, but this time, the hackers breached the hotel’s keycard system, making it impossible for guests to enter their rooms and stop card reprogramming.

The hackers asked for a sum of money to return the keycard system and room locks control. The administration, wholly occupied with the winter season, preferred to settle the ransom instead of finding a resolution.

The situation could have been more threatening as the entry point remains open once breached until removed. Luckily, the property took the precaution to mend a backdoor the hackers left and sealed their systems.

Within two years, there was a breach in every significant hotel property. Hackers stuck point-of-sale systems intending to get personal information. However, it is the first case where the hackers endangered the guests’ safety which was more concerning.

Hotels rely on intricate overlaying and joining computer systems. Acquiring entry to a system permits hackers to access other spots and presents chances. Moreover, hotel owners and operators should be cautious of ransomware which is becoming more popular nowadays. It gives the hacker a more or less quick return rather than selling private information because its value is rapidly declining. Additionally, they now tend to know the property’s susceptibility leaving a backdoor to target properties numerous times.

Here are recommended actions hotels should take to attain data security:

1. Examine the threat and the risk. Businesses differ, and each must determine the risks it is ready to handle and offset the other hazards. Evaluate disconnecting systems such as preventing the key card system from accessing the hotel’s website and preparing for workarounds. It can also consider allowing a manual system override through physical keys.



2. Train workforce. Human acts influence most data infringements, whether an error or a malicious act. We highly recommend pinpointing hazards and avoiding them through extensive workforce training to reduce cybercrime risks.

3. Strategize for the infringement. Setting up technical or workforce preemptive efforts is not enough since any system able of authorized entry is weak to unauthorized access. There will not be enough time to strategize a form of defense if and when it happens. Hotels should create and enforce trial retort strategies and keep them updated like any other business.

Timeshare Vs Hotel: Which is Right for Your Family?,"The conversation surrounding the benefits of timeshare vs hotel is always ongoing. The pros and cons of timeshares or hotels each really depend on every individual and family. Vacation styles, budget, location, frequency of travel, and length of stay are all important factors to consider. In this showdown, we weigh the difference between timeshare vs hotel when it comes to these major factors.

What exactly are the benefits of a timeshare compared to a hotel? For one, planning for vacations can be difficult, which is where a timeshare can come in handy. Vacation ownership can save you money! If you already have your lodging sorted out, then you can budget for the rest of your vacation needs. You can focus on saving for flights, vacation activities, and more. Plus, with that extra money in your pocket, you can plan on fully stocking the kitchen in your timeshare suite! So, how do you decide when it comes to timeshare versus a hotel? Weighing the pros and cons of timeshares and hotels is a great place to start.

The benefits of timeshare resorts and the accommodations they offer are the spacious, home-like units. Complete with multiple bedrooms, living areas, and complete kitchens, timeshares give owners a home away from home. What’s more, many timeshares encompass everything you could want in a vacation. With all of the incredible amenities, you might not even want to leave your resort.

In-Unit Kitchens and Dining

Unlike a hotel, timeshares have full-size kitchens, not just a microwave and mini-fridge. This is a big factor for families considering a timeshare over a hotel. If you’re just looking for a complimentary breakfast on your way out the door, maybe a hotel would be okay for you. Foodies might love exploring every dining option in the areas surrounding their hotel or resort, but sometimes a home-cooked meal just can’t be beaten. Especially when you’re traveling with a large family! Cooking in your timeshare’s kitchen some nights can be very helpful with staying within your budget.

Amenities

One of the pros of timeshare resorts that is often one of the cons of hotels is access to extensive amenities. Timeshares are designed with luxury and excitement in mind, so many have:

Spas

Multiple swimming pools, water features, lazy rivers, water slides, etc!

Amusement parks

Golf courses

Excursions

Snow skiing and water-skiing access

Casinos

Boating

Restaurants

Bars and pool-side bars

Vacation Exchange

A great thing about owning a timeshare is the chance to become a vacation exchange member. RCI (formerly Resort Condominiums International) and Interval International are two of the largest exchange companies for timeshares out there. Vacation exchange is as simple as signing up for a membership, depositing your week or points, and then swapping for a new location/week. You don’t get access to this type of vacation exchange with hotels.

As we mentioned before, timeshares come with large kitchens and living spaces. Those accommodations that come with timeshares shouldn’t be downplayed. Imagine a standard hotel room. Typically you’ll have a bed, a TV, a bathroom, and maybe a small table. Now, imagine your timeshare suite being three times larger than that! On average, that’s how much larger a timeshare suite is.

Additionally, you can enjoy separate locking bedrooms for extra privacy and relaxation. Not to mention, you won’t have to worry about over-packing-timeshares often come with washers and dryers in your room so you can wash all of your clothes like you would at home. This is one of the major pros of timeshares and cons of hotels, especially if you have a family.

One of the biggest benefits of timeshares is that they can save families money. If you’re able to find a timeshare you love on the resale market, this becomes even more so. Many timeshare resales are priced lower than they are from a developer. With a timeshare, you can guarantee your family vacations for years to come. While timeshare is not an investment, if you buy a timeshare outright, you’ll only then have to pay maintenance fees every year. Not to mention, there are timeshare financing options available to you.

Timeshare vs Hotel: Locations and Flexibility

When you’re looking for the pros and cons of timeshare vs hotel, location is a huge factor! When you own a timeshare, you can choose where you want to vacation from hundreds of incredible resorts. This is especially true when you own with a vacation club. The best part of being a vacation club member is the flexibility and resort locations! Each year, you are able to decide which resort you want to visit! You don’t have to stay at your “home resort” each year! With a vacation club, like the ones below, you are able to experience new destinations every year while still experiencing the incredible perks of owning a timeshare!

Disney Vacation Club is a great choice for the entire family. Their resorts are all within close proximity to major vacation destinations across the country. More than ten of the DVC resorts are within minutes of Walt Disney World. There are shuttles, monorails, and gondolas to transport guests straight from their accommodations to the fun. There are also DVC resorts on some of the country’s best beaches! Disney’s Hilton Head Resort will put you right in the center of the relaxing Lowcountry of South Carolina. Disney’s Aulani Resort provides guests with an authentic Hawaiian getaway, with a touch of Disney magic.

As you enter a DVC resort, you will be greeted by a cast member saying “welcome home!” Disney strives to make every DVC member feel right at home at their resorts and we think they really accomplish that goal. Disney Vacation Club members can submit an order form to have groceries delivered to their resort, giving you more time to spend with family and make memories.

Marriott Vacation Club is another top timeshare brand that offers beautiful resorts around the world. If you’re looking to stay in Orlando, you’re in luck! Marriott’s Cypress Harbor has that “Old Florida” charm about it, with gazebos, porches, and stunning pathways through the resort property. Close to all the attractions of Orlando, vacationers can also enjoy this resort, complete with full kitchens in every unit.

Marriott Vacation Club has over 50 resorts around the globe that have all of the incredible amenities that come with owning a timeshare. The difference between staying at a Marriott timeshare vs a Marriott hotel is accommodation size and sense of community. Being a Marriott Vacation Club member means that you can really experience the brand’s world-class hospitality all over the world!

Holiday Inn Club Vacations is a great option for those looking to buy a timeshare. HICV focuses on family-friendly vacations in fun destinations. If you’re looking to head to Orlando, Orange Lake Resort is a popular choice! With its winding lazy river, mini-golf, and seven restaurants, it’s clear to see why. Another great destination for family vacations is Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Smoky Mountain Resort puts you right in the center of the fun! This resort sits right at the foot of the Smokies, so guests are just minutes away from beautiful outdoor activities. Plus, there are tons of other attractions, like Dollywood, just minutes away from the resort!

Whether you want to have fun in the sun or go on an adventure in the mountains, Holiday Inn Club Vacations can provide the getaway of your dreams.

3 EMAIL MARKETING MISTAKES YOU NEED TO AVOID,"3 email marketing mistakes you need to avoid

With the evolution of marketing strategies, it’s more important than ever to come up with something that is personalized and helps you connect with your target audience without breaking the bank.

Email marketing is a marketing strategy that allows you to reach out to your old customers and score new ones, all while being easy and affordable.

Now you must think, it’s just an email, what could possibly go wrong, right? The answer : everything! There are bad email practices that can drive your customers away and waste all your effort spent on marketing. Here’s how.

Too Frequent Emails:

If your initial email marketing efforts become successful, you might get tempted to increase engagement by sending more emails, but what became the reason the customers came to you, could become the very reason they leave. Email burnout is a grave issue, and if you don’t schedule your emails with enough gap in between them, your customers will start to ignore your brand messages.

Crowded Email Content:

We cannot emphasize enough the importance of a minimalistic approach when it comes to marketing. Keep your motto — the simpler, the better. We get it, you don’t want your customers to miss out on the amazing deals you’re offering, but putting too much content in one email will make it unattractive. Try to stick to the main message of the email and avoid bulk email messages.

Skipping Segmentation:

Let’s face it, customers are tired of generic marketing messages, and everyone doesn’t want the same offers. Not segmenting customer lists based on their past behavior, demographics and interests is a killer email marketing mistake that will drive your sales down the drain. It’s important to segment your customer lists so all your audience gets exactly what they want and not the same boring content everyone else is getting.

Take the Stress out of Sales with Kanban,"A business lives and dies by the performance of its sales team. Businesses both big and small are always looking for processes and software solutions that could simplify the job for the salespeople and make it easier for managers to keep an eye on the progress.

One of the most popular products for this very reason is CRM software. Businesses like the intuitive nature of such software which gives managers an easy view of the whole pipeline while also allowing the sales team to work more efficiently in following leads and turning opportunities into sales.

Still, CRM software has its limitations:

The process of advancing an item through the pipeline is unnecessarily long: you open a record in detail view, then edit and change the appropriate field’s value.

There is no way for a manager to gain any contextual information. In a list view with all records listed at once, it is impossible to determine how one sales item is doing relative to another, or if any of the stages in the pipeline is stalling for some reason.

You have the complete picture of how items are distributed and where each item is in relation to the other.

Kanban Boards

This is where Kanban can help. Kanban boards is an idea consisting of cards arranged in columns, with the ability to shift them around with an interactive interface. Each column can represent a key value, with the idea being that you can filter all items by an entity and group it by different values so that you have the complete picture of how items are distributed and where each item is in relation to the other.

From a CRM perspective, imagine that all your potential sales are arranged as cards in columns where each column represents a stage in the pipeline. This way, you know how many sales are in each stage as well as if one stage has more items in it compared to others.

What’s more, the salespeople can simply drag and drop a card from one column to the other, when moving an item along the pipeline. This is a contrast to having to edit a record’s field after opening it in detail view which is a tedious process, but the only way to do things in traditional CRMs. No more.

RT Dynamic Boards

Now that you’ve seen what Kanban can do to enhance the CRM experience, let us tell you about the other features that we offer in our Kanban solution for SuiteCRM, Dynamic Boards.

Not only do you get the improved view which adds context to your sales, and the ability to easily progress items avoiding the drawn out process of editing fields for each record, you can also:

Mark a sale as closed won or closed lost with the same drag and drop simplicity. Set your own success and failure criteria if you don’t want to mark sales closed right away. See important information such as account name, assignee, and value of an item directly on the card without having to look through the detail view. Interact with the concerned account or contact about the sale record from within the Kanban view, because each card has buttons for email, phone, or even to take notes or add a calendar event for that record. Have all of these features available for Opportunities, Leads, as well as Cases modules.

With such simplification of sales operations, Dynamic Boards takes the stress out of sales for the staff and allows managers to stay on top of things much more easily.

Let’s Talk About pHUMP?,"We’ve had many questions in our Discord that we will address with articles like this one as well as upcoming community calls. Today we’re going to talk about pHUMP and its importance to Whale.Loans.

Overview

pHUMP is to Whale.Loans what pOHM is to Olympus DAO. It was the token given out during our private sale. Our private round was for partners who aligned with our vision and are willing to help us successfully achieve our goals. This money was raised for things like audits, development, marketing and things like that. So we would like to issue a special thank you to Impossible Finance, LD Capital, DeSpread, Efficient Frontier, and a handful of other individual partners.

How it works

As you know, we cannot pre-mine HUMP. So we issued pHUMP which is a derivative of HUMP. pHUMP gives the holder the option to mint HUMP by burning pHUMP and providing the intrinsic value of HUMP. For example, an investor would provide 1 BUSD and 1 pHUMP to mint 1 HUMP.

pHUMP is worth the price of HUMP minus the intrinsic value, and it only makes sense to redeem it when HUMP is above intrinsic value.

The best thing about pHUMP is that it can’t be redeemed all at once and dumped onto the market. pHUMP is vested based on supply. This creates the best incentives for all parties involved. pHUMP is vested along with supply, and are only redeemed when we trade with a positive intrinsic value. We the team, investors and advisors, don’t only want the supply to increase, or the price to go up, we want both. And so do you.

The Specifics

The team, investor, and advisors pHUMP cumulatively vest as 10.5% of HUMP supply. This means that at 1m HUMP supply, a maximum of 105k pHUMP can be redeemed. At 10m HUMP supply, it’s 1.05m pHUMP. There’s a lot of upside for holders, but it is dependent on actual growth of the protocol.

The breakdown is as follows:

Team: 200m pHUMP and 6.5% supply

Investors: 250k pHUMP and 3% supply

Advisors: 100k pHUMP and 1% supply

Ultimately we decided on lower numbers than Olympus DAO because we were not the originators of this token design and we believe we can innovate and build a scalable ecosystem with less.

The Plan

These funds and resources will be used to support and build out our ecosystem. The treasury will be completely separate and will never be used for business purposes such as marketing or salaries.

In the near future, our focus will be on increasing usability. Our ultimate goal will be to onboard a user into any of our products in 1–3 clicks. We are also working on gas optimizations to help users save on gas fees. Most importantly, we want to focus on security for users as well as the protocol so creating products with insurance baked into them for user protection is a top priority. Also, in addition to regular audits we’ll be creating a bug bounty program as a serious measure of protocol safety. These things must be done first before we roll out additional products. Over the next couple of articles we are going to talk more about current and future products and infrastructure that will shape our ecosystem.

FNDZ staking on Ferrum,"FNDZ is teaming up with Ferrum to offer our holders a web-based staking service which allows you to stake your FNDZ tokens for constant time-based returns based on the duration of your staking commitment. In other words, the longer you stake, the higher the rewards.

We will be opening a new staking pool on 1st Jan 2022 at 11am UTC

FNDZ Staking Terms

Full maturity: 90 days

Full Rewards: 14% APR annualized

Early withdrawal: 60 days

Early withdrawal: 8% APR annualized

No Minimum, MAX stake allowed 150000 $FNDZ

Pool size: 7 million $FNDZ

Contribution window opens on 1st Jan 2022 at 11am UTC

Contribution window closes on 8th Jan 2021 at 11am UTC if pool is not filled before then

The option to unstake will open up in 90 days (full maturity), with early withdrawal after 60 days. The APR will be reduced to 8% in the FNDZ Staking pool should you choose to remove your tokens before the full 90 days of the staking pool term.

Staking $FNDZ Through Ferrum’s Flexible White Glove Staking Service

With the emergence of DeFi and the appeal of passive income, staking has taken on a fresh new relevance. Unfortunately, DeFi staking has been chiefly reserved for big-cap projects with mainnet, leaving hundreds of exciting new projects with few flexible options to offer staking and liquidity farming for their token.

This gap in the market is why Ferrum built their flexible DeFi Staking Platform. Participants lock their tokens and earn high yields based on the length of time staked. It’s like a decentralized high-yield bank account, with maximum customization for projects and flexibility for participants!

Thanks to the flexibility offered by Ferrum Network solutions, FNDZ will be able to launch its Staking program, which will help to increase their token utility while rewarding community supporters and their early investors.

If you are new to Staking, we have a handy guide below.

A step-by-step guide to staking FNDZ:

Download and install an Ethereum web3 compatible wallet, such as MetaMask. Because Metamask is the most widely adopted wallet, we’ll use it for this staking tutorial.

Add Binance smart chain to your MetaMask. Then import the FNDZ token contract address by clicking ‘Add Token’ in your MetaMask wallet. This is the contract address — 0x7754c0584372D29510C019136220f91e25a8f706

Deposit FNDZ into your MetaMask (plus enough BNB to pay for gas fees). If you need help with getting FNDZ, visit our ‘How to buy’ guide.

Next, go to our staking website

Select the FNDZ Staking pool you would like to contribute to and press “Stake” (when it opens).

After you’ve clicked on “Stake”, the MetaMask pop-up notification will open. Click “confirm” at the bottom of the menu to connect to the staking smart contract.

When you are ready to stake, press “Stake”.

This will take you to a new page. First, read and understand the disclaimer and then, if you are happy, agree to the terms.

Next, input the amount of FNDZ you wish to stake.

Then confirm the amount is correct and approve the allocation.

Allow MetaMask to spend your FNDZ (i.e. send your FNDZ to the staking contract) and press “confirm”.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON TRANSACTION FEES : You can edit the BSC Network gas fee in MetaMask by pressing “edit” and choosing a custom gas fee. Note that lower fees have slower transaction times (this is optional as the bsc network is faster and cheaper than Ethereum).

: You can edit the BSC Network gas fee in MetaMask by pressing “edit” and choosing a custom gas fee. Note that lower fees have slower transaction times (this is optional as the bsc network is faster and cheaper than Ethereum). Next, confirm your staking transaction is accurate and press “submit”.

MetaMask will pop up. Confirm your transaction in MetaMask, and remember to edit the gas fee if you wish to change the increase or decrease transaction speeds.

Finally, wait until the transaction goes through (see countdown on the right hand corner of the page), and after a few seconds your stake should be confirmed!

If you have further questions, please drop into our Telegram group chat where our official FNDZ Admins will be glad to assist you.

As always, thank you all for your support, and happy staking!

What Is Content Writing? Tips To Create The Best Online Content,"The process of receiving payments for your products or services online requires thorough planning, integration, and implementation to ensure a seamless payment process for your users and make sure that you are incurring the lowest charges from the payment gateway yourself. In addition, the privacy and safety of your buyers will be essential if you want to guarantee that your business is going to be a success. These factors make it crucial to hire the right mobile app development company in Dubai or web development company in Dubai to build your E-commerce platform.

Therefore, you need to take your time with the selection process to guarantee that you are choosing the right payment gateway for your mobile apps or web application. In this blog, we will be talking about your options and the main factors you would need to consider when selecting the payment gateway for your platform.

Some of the most popular payment gateways in the middle east include:

We mention these payment gateway providers because they are some of the most popular ones in the middle east and have proven to provide a good service. Nevertheless, we will be looking into several essential factors that will be essential for your decision regarding E-commerce payment options.

What should you be looking for when selecting your payment gateway?

Before we get into the details on what you should consider when making a decision, you need to remember that a payment gateway is a software application that helps process credit card information and enables online payments.

This means that the payment gateway requires a certain level of security with practical features to be a viable option. Deciding which gateway to use is something as relevant as choosing your E-commerce website development company.

With that said, now we can go over the main reasons and the primary considerations to keep in mind when selecting the right kind of payment gateway service. You should make sure that either of the options you consider will provide these essential features.

The main features and services to expect include:

Optimal security standards and certifications

Multi-currency support

Simple and intuitive checkout process

Easy process of integration

Customer service availability

Accessible prices and free estimates

Optimal security standards and certifications

There has never been anything more important for E-commerce than enhanced security. You need to note that you will be dealing with highly confidential information provided by your customers, such as credit card numbers, addresses, contact details, etc. As such, the last thing you want is to use a payment gateway that is not taking all required precautions and measures to secure your client’s data.

The certifications that a payment gateway requires include the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standard accreditation, which is a mandate by credit card brands. This means that without this certification, the payment gateway will not be able to operate with most credit card brands.

Any web development company in Dubai that you work with would advise you to ensure that the security measures taken by the payment processing service are optimal. This is expected when an E-commerce website development company starts to work with you on any E-commerce project.

Multi-currency support

Another critical factor that needs to be mentioned here is the currency support that various payment gateways offer. This is a crucial point to consider while selecting the right payment gateway partner for your platform, as it would directly impact your costs. If you plan to take your E-commerce business to various countries, you must keep in mind that users usually prefer to purchase products in their local currency. It is proven through a study conducted by Penton Research and E4X, where it was found that at least one-third of the users showed a reluctance to purchase when the E-commerce platform was tailored to a single currency. They either abandoned their shopping cart, bought fewer products, or left the E-commerce site to check for conversion rates and never returned.

Even if you decided to go ahead with a single currency like USD, you must be mindful of the additional charges your users would incur while making a purchase and the charges you would incur through your bank for the frequent conversions. This could lead to a bad experience for your users and must be addressed at the beginning.

The simple and intuitive checkout process

It may seem like the checkout process for a payment getaway is always going to be simple, but there are many cases when it can be confusing and frustrating for the customer. The biggest issue when this happens is that many potential buyers could end up abandoning their shopping carts before checking out if they get frustrated with the process.

Easy process of integration

Sometimes the biggest issue with a payment gateway is that they may have a highly complex integration process due to a lack of proper documentation. Proper documentation for any payment gateway is essential for your web development partner to integrate the payment gateway with your E-commerce platform. This can lead to additional development efforts spent by your web development agency to troubleshoot and integrate the necessary features of the payment gateway and thereby increase the overall cost of your E-commerce platform.

The less complicated the integration, the easier it is for any mobile app development company in Dubai to help you with the process. This also means that the development costs are going to be much lower.

Customer Service Availability

The reliability and availability of a customer service department with any payment gateway vendor are going to be essential features. You don’t want to be in a situation requiring immediate attention only to find that the payment gateway service is only available at certain hours or days of the week.

Customer service should be available at all times when it comes to a service like E-commerce. You need to consider this a critical factor while deciding the best payment gateway vendor for your E-commerce website.

Transparent pricing

There are many payment gateways services available in the market, and it is important to have relevant details regarding their terms, conditions, and pricing readily available to ensure you are making an informed decision regarding your payment gateway partner for your E-commerce platform.

Our services include professional payment gateway consultation.

We at Innobayt, can help you choose the best payment gateway option based on your business model, target market, etc. and develop your mobile or web application at competitive prices. We have enormous experience when it comes to web development and mobile app development, and this is the reason why we have become a respected E-commerce website development company in Dubai.

Trade Show Marketing with The VIDEO Business,"Trade Show Marketing with The VIDEO Business

Lisa Lyttle here with The VIDEO Business. Let’s talk about trade show marketing. Now that the world is slowly opening up, trade shows are back, and I’m sure you are eager to be part of them!

You’ve invested a lot of time, effort and money into your trade show booth but are you really getting everything you can out of it? Are you handing out brochures at the show and relying solely on your sales staff to chase potential clients down and explain to them who you are and what you do? And I can almost bet, that there’s a number of occasions in the past, where you’ve come back from a show and you wish you had a greater impact.

Well I’ve got a super easy solution for you, what you need is a video at your trade show booth explaining who you are and what you do.

An explainer video is powerful BEFORE, DURING and AFTER your trade show event. You’re able to tell your story to a maximum number of people in the shortest amount of time possible and your video can be understood with or without sound, just by the graphics that it’s displaying on the screen. So while your prospects are walking down the isles towards your booth, they can watch your video and by the time they get to your booth, they’ll already have a good idea of what you have to offer. This makes it super easy for your sales staff to answer any questions they have when they arrive at your booth and to explain a little bit further.

After your event, share your video across multiple social media platforms like LinkedIn or YouTube. Put it on your company homepage, so it’s the very first thing anyone will see when they visit your website. Present your video during sales meetings, add it to your email signature and send it out to everyone that has visited your trade show booth…it’s a friendly, gentle reminder of who you are and how you can help them.

In these days, everything is going video, no one wants to spend their time reading long-winded sales copy about something they’re not even sure if they need. Let me help you create a short, engaging and entertaining video that will help you explain your products and services to the world.

If you need help creating a powerful, entertaining and memorable video for your business, contact me today and let’s chat.

How Much Does It Cost To Operate An Autonomous Vehicle?,"Almost nothing. Self-driving cars are insanely cheaper to operate than a normal car

The Origin, a self-driving car with no steering wheels or pedals, designed by GM-owned Cruise

This is the first in a series of stories in which I will show you just how HUGE the impact of AVs will be in our lives.

We’ll begin by looking at how much it would cost for a self-driving car to take you from Downtown San Francisco to Ocean Beach, on the city’s western end — and how this compares to the costs that an Uber or Lyft driver would face on the same trip.

Before we start, let’s agree on how to calculate these costs

First, we’ll only include variable costs, that is, those that occur directly as a result of the ride. We’ll ignore fixed expenses like software development, because they are not causally linked to the trip.

Second, we’ll include the following variable costs: electricity, depreciation, insurance, cleaning, maintenance, and driver cost. We won’t include customer service cost, as these are harder to estimate, and usually low.

Third, we’ll choose the Cruise Origin as our benchmark for AVs. The Origin has no steering wheel or pedals, and is expected to be released in 2023 by Cruise, a General Motors-owned company. Even if you wanted to, you couldn’t drive it, so it’s the quintessential autonomous vehicle.

Fourth, our non-AV benchmark will be an Uber driver riding a Chevy Bolt. The Bolt is electric, and choosing an electric car allows for a fairer comparison, as the Origin is battery-powered too.

Fifth, we will focus on cost, and not on price. Cost is a measure of the resources that are consumed when making the drive, and is straightforward to calculate. Price is how much the service provider (Uber or Cruise) will charge you for the ride, and is more complex to determine.

Sixth: We’ll assume that both cars have a 60% utilization, which is approximately what we see in New York City. They’ll be driving with a passenger 60% of the time, while the other 40% will be “empty” miles in which the cars will be driving to pick up a new passenger or waiting for a new call. We’ll assume that the 40% is all driving, and that there is no “parking” involved.

Finally, we’ll use estimates and common sense when we cannot find reliable data for any given cost component.

Alright, now that we have set the ground rules, let’s dive into the costs.

San Francisco, California, and our simulated ride, from the Civic Center to the Dutch Windmill at Ocean Beach

COST BREAKDOWN

Electricity

Our trip from Downtown to the Beach is 5.7 miles long (or 8.5 miles including the “empty” distance driven to the next passenger).

The Origin will probably need around 29 kwh / 100 miles (similar to the Bolt), so that’s 1.65 kwh for the trip. We’re only missing the electricity cost, which in San Francisco is about $0.25 per kwh. That gets us to $0.41 for the trip, and adding the “empty” distance to the next rider, 3.8 miles, we get to $0.62.

That’s pretty cheap. If you drove this same route with a Chevy Malibu, which does about 24 mpg, it would cost you about 1.41 cents at the current California gas price of $4.5 / gallon.

But remember: our Uber driver has an electric Chevy Bolt and gets the same 62 cents. So the AV cost advantage is not really related to the electricity cost.

Tie between Uber and Cruise at 62 cents

2. Depreciation

This is where the Origin starts pulling ahead. According to Cruise, the Origin will cost about $50,000 and last about one million miles before it needs to be retired. That’s a lot more than the useful life of the Bolt, which is 400,000 miles.

Quick math shows that the depreciation cost per mile is 5 cents per mile ($50,000 / 1,000,000) and that the depreciation cost for our trip to the beach is then 5.7 * 5 = 29 cents, or 44 cents with 60% utilization.

If we drove the Bolt, which costs the driver $33,000, the cost would be 71 cents. Advantage Origin.

Cruise beats Uber, 44 cents vs. 71 cents

3. Insurance

This is another cost line where AVs will crush competition, if we make one simple assumption: that self-driving vehicles will never be at fault for a traffic accident.

Wait, what? That’s kinda hard to believe, right? Well, it’s closer to the truth than you may think. Data from Waymo — Cruise’s Google-owned competitor — can help us.

Waymo’s cars drove 6.2 million miles autonomously around Phoenix, Arizona, from January 2019 to September 2020. During this time, the firm’s cars were involved in 47 collisions and, according to the company, nearly all of those were not Waymo’s fault. How many does “nearly all” mean? Waymo doesn’t specify, but I’m guessing no more than 2 or 3. Which would basically mean 4–6% of all accidents. That’s very close to ZERO, and, to simplify, we’ll call it zero.

What type of insurance do app drivers and Cruise need?

With this controversial but credible assumption, we can move on to understand the two insurance policies we might need:

Liability coverage for app drivers: California requires Uber drivers to carry $1 million in liability insurance to cover the passengers and property involved in an accident. This covers accidents where the insured Uber driver is to blame for the accident, so the Origin doesn’t need it.

California requires Uber drivers to carry $1 million in liability insurance to cover the passengers and property involved in an accident. This covers accidents where the insured Uber driver is to blame for the accident, so the Origin doesn’t need it. Uninsured /underinsured driver: When someone other than the app driver is responsible for the accident, the coverage above does not apply. But maybe the other party at fault doesn’t have insurance, and can’t pay for the damages of the crash. To guard their users against such risk, Uber offers this “uninsured driver coverage”, even though this is not required by law. Cruise should too, because as long as there are bad drivers sharing the road with the Origin, this risk still exists.

How much does all of this cost? According to Allstate, which offers insurance to app drivers in California:

Liability coverage adds up to $1,248 per year for 50,000 miles, or 14 cents for our 5.7-mile trip, 21 cents with the “empty” miles. Again, Cruise doesn’t have to pay for this, but Uber drivers do.

Uninsured / underinsured coverage costs $360 a year for 50,000 miles → 4 cents for our trip, or 6 cents including the “empty” miles. Both Cruise and our Uber driver need to pay for this.

Cruise beats Uber, 6 cents vs. 27 cents

4. Maintenance

The Origin and the Bolt need to be maintained from time to time so they can safely tranport passengers. There is no data available on how much it will cost to maintain the Origin…but we do have a good estimate for the Bolt. That comes from Edmunds, a well-known car-review portal.

We also know that, as a rule of thumb, the more it costs to build a car, the more it costs to maintain it. And we know the Origin’s and the Bolt’s production cost: $50,000 and $29,000, respectively. (You’ll pay $33,000 for a new Bolt because GM and the dealer need to make a profit, but $29,000 is what it costs to make it).

Now for the actual cost: Edmunds expects you to spend $3,021 on maintenance for every 75,000 miles driven on your Bolt, or 23 cents for our trip, 35 cents with the “empty” miles. The Origin costs 72% more to produce, so we’ll just assume that the maintenance costs are 72% higher → 60 cents including the “empty” miles.

Uber wins, with 35 cents, vs. 60 cents for the Origin

5. Cleaning

From time to time, Uber drivers need to vacuum and wipe the vehicle’s floor and seats to keep it looking and smelling fresh. Less often, they will wash the outside too, to give the vehicle that shiny new car look.

How often do they do it? The Uber sub-reddit seems to indicate once a day for the interior, and a once a week for the exterior. The same would apply for Cruise, as their passengers will still demand a spotless vehicle.

For the costs, let’s assume that a car drives about 150 miles per day:

Interior cleaning: 15 minutes per day + $1 of cleaning products per day. With a cleaner costing about $20 / hour, that comes to $6 / day, 4 cents a mile → 35 cents per trip with “empty” miles

Exterior: A standard cash wash is about $30, or 3 cents per mile → 25 cents per trip

The total adds up to 40 cents per trip, which is a lot! More than insurance, and almost the same as electricity.

If I were to be super rigorous, I’d say that the Origin has a small disadvantage over the Bolt: its exterior sensors, like LIDARs, cameras and radars, need constant cleaning, because it relies on them to “see” the road and drive safely. How often is this required? Maybe once a week? Maybe never because they have some “auto-cleaning” function? Not sure.

But we know that the Origin is already going to be cleaned once a day, so the marginal cost of cleaning the sensors would be very small. It’s just a matter of spending an extra 2–3 minutes wiping them. We’ll call it not relevant for our calculations.

Uber and Cruise tie at 60 cents per trip

Waymo’s vehicles like this adapted Jaguar have been roaming the streets of San Francisco for a while. Notice the driver inside, who can still take over if needed. This won’t be possible — or hopefully needed — in the Origin

6. Driver cost

You guessed it: it’s zero for Cruise. The company is spending a lot of money on developing its self-driving software, but this is a fixed cost. Once the program is installed in the car, it doesn’t cost anything more to take passengers from one point to another.

For an Uber driver, it’s a different story: Everytime they ride, they expect to earn a wage. It’s how they make a living, afterall. So there is a cost here. We’ll calculate it based on the trip length, utilization rate, and on the wage that a driver would demand. Let’s dive into the math:

The trip would take 31 minutes at the SF downtown average speed of 11 mph…

…but the drivers expect to be paid for more than just these 31 minutes. They are only carrying a passenger 60% of the time they are working, but also want money for the other 40% of the time. If we didn’t factor this time in, we’d get a much lower pay, one at which drivers would prefer to work somewhere else. Factoring in the 40%, the actual duration of the trip is 52 minutes.

At $16.32 per hour, which is the San Francisco minimum wage, these 52 minutes cost $14.06, vs. ZERO for Cruise. That’s an insane advantage. Let’s discuss it below.

Cruise beats Uber, $0 to $14.06

COST SUMMARY, PRICING AND IMPLICATIONS

Cost summary

Adding up everything, the total cost for an Uber driver to move you from the Civic Center to Ocean Beach comes to $16.60. Out of this total, $2.54 comes from non-driver costs, and $14.06 from the driver.

Summary of all trip-related costs. The ‘Driver’ line is the main difference between the two alternatives

For a self-driving vehicle, the cost for the same trip is $2.31, all from non-driver costs. That is 86% lower than the Uber driver.

86% is A LOT. Like really a lot. It’s all the more significant because transportation is a very significant expense to all of us. The average American family spends $9,600 on transportation a year, the second highest budget category behind housing. Imagine if I told you that in 10 years, all houses would cost 86% less. You’d call me crazy, for sure.

Pricing

But let’s remember that it’s one thing to calculate the variable cost of the ride, and another one to calculate how much Cruise or Waymo will charge us for it. They are companies and want to maximize their profits, so we can expect to pay more than $2.31.

Exactly how much? This will be the subject of my next post. To calculate the price, I will borrow concepts from microeconomics like demand curve, marginal revenue and profit maximization. Another key aspect of price calculation is the variable cost of the ride — and this is the reason why this text focuses on variable costs.

But while we are still not sure about the final price, one thing is certain: it will be much cheaper. This brings powerful implications to the transportation world as we know it.

What does this lower cost even mean? Implications

At the very least, lower prices will drive a lot more people to use AV ride-hailing services vs. other alternatives like buses, the subway, or even walking or cycling.

More demand means more cars on the streets, and potentially more traffic jams. But it’s not all bad: it also means less public space reserved to parking, as AVs will either be parked in their company’s garage when they are charging or undergoing maintenance work, or not parked at all.

To understand exactly how much more traffic, or how much less parking space is needed, we’ll first need to understand how many people will use AVs. And this number depends on how much Cruise or Waymo will charge for their services.

Types of fashion: understanding styles right now,"Intro

Do you think men and women both are crazy about fashion? We are going to discuss about types of fashion. Read the article till the end to get insight in to the concept of fashion. Fashion meaning is to adopt a specific style in clothing and personal grooming. It makes people distinguished from other people. These days celebrities and designers are very serious about fashion. Hairstyle, footwear, wristwatches, bracelets, lockets, and clothes are included in fashion.

Types of Fashion

Limited time edition

This type of product is for those people who want something unique or exclusive. These are not costly products but are produced in limited quantity and sold.

Designer wear

Many designers around the globe produce products for special industries or occasions. These products are mostly costly. Examples include the film industry and wedding occasions.

Timeless

These products are cheap to very costly but never go out of fashion and people can use them even after a decade. Some examples are casual shoes, nightclothes, etc.

Street

These are the cheapest products. Every second person uses these products. People having low incomes mostly use these products.

Diffusion

These are outdated products having high costs sold at low cost so that people having low income can use them.

December 21 Commentary,"Commentary:

Perhaps we were all expecting a different end of the year, with some fitting fireworks. The market, however, after the welcomed Christmas rally, has delivered the harsh truth with a correction on the 27th that brought us back to the lowest prices since the September lows. Low liquidity seems to blame, however looking closely at the price performance of Bitcoin over the year, and comparing it with the S&P500, as displayed in Figure 2, we observe that twice this year we had periods of inverse correlation in the performance trend. After the Summer correction, the two time-series began to diverge again around mid-November, when crypto markets initiated their downward trajectory, while the equity market, despite some short-lived correction, has kept pushing to new highs. Whether this continued behaviour hides more significance than just end of the year lack of liquidity shall be seen over the coming weeks when institutional players are expected to deploy more capital in the crypto markets.

Figure 2: Comparison of the yearly price performance of Bitcoin and S&P500. It can be noticed without the aid of correlation measures, how we had two instances of diametrically opposite behaviour. First in the Summer, with the May crash, then the current period, after the December crash. Historically such a difference in behaviour has been resolved in a few months. Source: Trading View

Looking closely at the chart in Figure 2, it can be noticed that most of the divergence in performance is due to the market crash on December 3rd, ultimately a reaction to the FED tapering plans and the spreading of the Omicron variant. Both caused continued downward pressure throughout the month and should be expected to produce headwinds into the new year.

In the meantime, Derivative markets paid the price with an Open Interest (OI) wash-out in the region of 20%-30% triggered by the liquidations on the 3rd of December, as well as the unwinding of directional longs and cash-and-carry shorts, set to profit from the demand for leverage products that characterises neutral and in particular bullish market regimes. As displayed in Figure 3, the OI of Bitcoin products crashed for both linear and inverse contracts, however, while the former has found new footing and recovered the interest of buyers and sellers, the latter, crypto-native products, struggled to recover. A theme that has characterised the last couple of years, with every crash providing an opportunity for linear derivatives to gain market share. Lower OI and a lack of demand in the past few weeks has not only characterised Future products but also Option Markets, with a monster expiry on December 31st that has halved the size of the market overnight. As displayed in Figure 4, the uncertainty has caused traders to be cautious with only a small percentage of the OI being rolled into farther maturities. The low demand, as well as the increasing influence of DeFi on the markets, has pushed Implied Volatility (IV) below the levels to be historically considered normal. With the increasing popularity of yield generation via passive option-selling strategies by decentralised protocols, we can expect the IV to remain compressed on the shorter maturities, as well as pinning the whole curve down.

Figure 3: Open interest time series for Bitcoin contracts, both linear (BTC denominated — green) and inverse (USD denominated — purple) since late November. It can be easily identified the drop due to the liquidations and position unwinding on December 3rd. Since then, linear instruments Open Interest has recovered the pre-crash levels (partially thanks to the price appreciation), while inverse instruments struggle to recover their popularity Source: Coinalyze

Market participants seem to be taking an approach of wait and see, as liquidity slowly comes back from the Winter Holidays. Source: Deribit

Rates across the curve for Futures products have also been compressed, as discussed earlier, with Perpetual contracts (Figure 5) and Fix Maturity contracts (Figure 6) demonstrating a lack of demand with low rates and a flat behaviour during the second half of the month, after the initial volatility post-crash dissipated. After a few weeks of discounts on the Perpetual contracts, following the crash at the beginning of December, funding rates seems to have stabilised, with all contracts exhibiting neutral premia, the first sign that traders’ confidence in the market is increasing and sentiment improving.

Figure 5: Average Funding Rates for linear and inverse BTC contracts, grouped by collateralisation currency (USD — green, USDT — blue, BTC — red). It can be noticed how the rates have remained subdued during the second half of November and the majority of December, with a slow and painful recovery from the depths caused by the crash on December 3rd. Source: Trading View

Figure 6: Annualised premia of March Future contracts over the last two months. Notice how the volatile trend, albeit downward, has died down in December, with rates barely moving from their baseline return of 8%-10%. Source: Trading View

Looking away from the short-term price performance of the majors, a thriving ecosystem can be found in microcap coins and projects oriented towards the creator economy, gamified DeFi, p2e games (play to earn) and similar. In Figure 1 we show an assortment of “Flippenings” that happened in the few prior weeks and, albeit their scope is limited, they offer some insight into the transformational trends that we are experiencing. NFTs are more popular than Ethereum itself, Metaverse is more clicked than Cryptocurrency, the most expensive art piece from a living artist is now a digital image minted as NFT, Bored Apes are more expensive than CryptoPunks (read as “a vibrant community takes over the establishment”).

The old guard should watch its back, the incumbents are being displaced and a new reality is taking shape. Despite this warning, in Figure 7 we show the ranking over time in the app store of a number of retail crypto platforms. It can be observed how the sentiment has actually cooled down during December, with Coinbase and Crypto.com apps tumbling down the rankings below the 100th and the 50th place respectively.

The headwind for most crypto assets is partially due to the tightening in financial conditions that are expected over the coming months, as the FED slows down its bond purchase program and increases the rates, on the back of rising inflation and normalisation of economic conditions. As Crypto was born from the ashes of the 2008 Financial Crisis it has historically been focused on payments and financial disintermediation, tying the fortunes of the market with the ebbs and flows of the overarching financial system, a system from which the crypto community wants to break apart. Enters Web3, NFTs and social tokens that offer a compelling use case beyond finance, onboarding millions of people to the Blockchain ecosystem, and reaching a crowd that had no interest in trading and speculative investments.

Figure 7: Popularity of retail-oriented Crypto apps in the US Google play store. Representative of the sentiment over the last few weeks, we observe the popularity of those that used to be top-ranking apps at the beginning of November crashing down to sub 50th and sub 100th ranking (Coinbase and Crypto.com respectively). Source: The Block

Despite the increasing institutionalisation of DeFi and the growing interests of the traditional financial industry towards decentralised investments products (loans, swaps and derivatives) as well as improved settlement channels, the sector has lagged the market over the last few months, with infrastructure plays, Web3 and games decisively outperforming as they enter the spotlight for the first time (the latter two in particular). With major fashion brands (Dolce and Gabbana, Burberry, Hermes), sports brands (Adidas, Nike), tech companies (Facebook), artists (Kings of Leon, Eminem, Jay-Z, Snoop Dog, Ice Cube) and many other businesses and celebrities betting on the space, the industry can thrive during times of adverse macroeconomic conditions.

In Figure 8 we show the historic active developer count over the last 8 years, highlighting the positive trend and the increasing participation resulting from the newly found interest in the Metaverse and, more generally, non-financial applications of decentralised protocols. Expect network effects to transform the landscape in the years to come, with the most talented software engineers, researchers and designers joining the space and fuelling exponential growth in user adoption with improved interfaces and compelling use-cases.",https://medium.com/@fasanaradigital/december-21-commentary-d2f8eeeb4bfb,['Fasanara Digital'],2022-01-06 15:03:54.471000+00:00,"['Bitcoin', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Investing', 'Trading', 'Market Research Reports']"
5 Major Industries enefiting From Augmented Reality Technology,"e

Augmented Reality (AR) is one of the technologies that nowadays has experienced a boom in its expansion and that is showing to have an impact not only in industrial fields but in people’s lives in many ways. This technology aims to enhance one’s experience by involving overlaying visual, auditory, or other sensory information onto the world. Based on a report by ResearchAndMarkets.com’s the AR market was valued at USD 14.7 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 88.4 billion by 2026. Here we can add that the key factors driving the growth of the AR market include surging demand for AR devices and applications in healthcare, growing demand for AR in retail and e-commerce sectors due to COVID-19, rising investments in the AR market, increasing demand for AR devices and technology in the global automotive industry, and many other industries as well. As AR technology finds new applications day by day, saves costs, and helps to keep the business continuity, demand and investment in AR will continue to grow. AR application is diverse, so let’s see below some of its existing applications in emerging market industries:

1. Automotive

Many businesses operating in the automotive industry have successfully embraced new technologies such as AR, as a need to change the way of operations and to build a bridge of collaboration between experts and field workers. Nowadays with the help of AR-based remote support integrated into smart glasses experts are able to make live annotations that overlay into real-world during work, field workers can work hands-free without distractions while receiving instructions on how to assemble a specific machine. With this AR-based remote collaboration, the accuracy of field workers can go up to 96% and they are able to work 30% faster. In addition, AR remote support has demonstrated great potential for fieldworkers' training. Connected in real-time with an experienced expert, field workers from different locations all around the world, are trained for different assembly tasks before they start performing their work. Training field workers to perform their job correctly have productive results in fewer operator errors that eventually cause slowdowns and downtime.

2. Manufacturing

Given all the many benefits that remote support offers, the manufacturing industry is utilizing AR technology in order to stay relevant, innovative, and competitive. AR-remote support is one of the main tools that help operating businesses in the manufacturing industry to achieve functional goals such as reducing costs, improving efficiency, increasing safety, and expanding production capacity. In manufacturing businesses, production downtime due to machine breakdowns is a serious threat and it could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Machinery malfunctions need to be prevented to minimize manufacturing downtime. But with the help of AR remote support, the field workers from received instructions on their smart devices can quickly visually identify the problem and resolve it or even prevent the downtime from ever occurring. Businesses of the manufacturing industry through implementing AR remote support monitor, inspect, update, and repair their machinery, by this, are able to create the right atmosphere for meeting goals to help to eliminate machinery downtime.

3. Logistics and Transportation

Innovative technologies such as AR enable logistics and transportation businesses to optimize efficiency by automating and standardizing the workflows. Using AR can enhance warehouses’ maintenance, improve packaging and order picking processes, and reduce the time spent on transportation and delivery. To lower the error rates and ease the workers’ decision-making process in logistics, it is necessary to use technologies like AR and simplify tasks. It will also clarify most of the logistic business steps like assembly, storage, sorting, inventory, order picking, transportation, and more.

4. Oil and Gas

AR applications are already enabling oil and gas companies to transform their operational processes by reducing expenditures, enhancing remote collaboration, and helping to stay competitive in the market. Considering all the features and benefits, the implementation of AR in oil and gas operations is proving to be really efficient and indeed can transform the sector. Due to the harmful environment in which field workers are exposed, they are prone to health damage that can lead to loss of life. Through expert guidance field, workers perform their tasks in safe environments.

5. Healthcare

The tremendous growth of AR is being experienced especially in the healthcare sector, creating business opportunities for companies with AR expertise. In the healthcare field, the potential of AR is manifested in the ability that enable the presentation of 3D medical models in real-time at remote locations. The AR-based remote support can help doctors diagnose and treat patients accurately. With access to real-time patient data, they can perform functions better than before. In addition, by ignoring distance and boundaries AR brings the most specialized surgeons to the same operating room alongside the specialists who will perform the operation. Furthermore, doctors can record video and audio while examining a patient and can use them at a later time to train their students across the globe.

AR knows no boundaries but plays an important role in the operation of businesses despite the many and quite difficult challenges. This technology can be seen as an innovative solution to be adopted and that provides many benefits for businesses operating in different industrial fields. The power of AR connects experts with field workers around the world with real-time data, guidance, and the power of remote support. The impact of this technology is an excellent example of how the operational process of different industry types has been transformed and how the quality and productivity of work have increased.

Is Netflix destined to be doomed?,"Is Netflix destined to be doomed?

Netflix has exceptional organizational culture, leadership style, and innovational practices which lead to the world’s first video streaming service that has 214 million paid subscribers. On my journey to understanding Netflix deeper, I am sad and disheartened to see that Netflix might fail in this decade due to the following reasons.

Limited Options: Netflix only streams TV shows, movies, and documentaries. Competitors are providing additional services like live TV, sports streaming, music, and games included in the same subscription plan. Decentralized streaming: With the advent of technology innovation, decentralized video streaming services are ready to go mainstream. The service is as good as any paid subscription but offered at a much lower price. Customers are being rewarded with community and crypto tokens for using, hosting, and maintaining these services. Alternate cable TV: Recently, IPTV has disrupted the cable TV industry by providing personalized TV viewership options. IPTV is taking 14% of the OTT industry, and YouTube TV is yet to roll out globally. This will directly affect Netflix viewership.

As an aspiring strategy & innovation consultant, I propose the following solutions:

Enemy of my enemy is my Friend: Team up with companies facing the same global competitors (Apple, Google, Amazon) in a different industry like Spotify for music, Gameloft for games. Make deals and establish partnerships where all the companies can benefit mutually. Improve the merchandise business: The Netflix shop does not have good designs to convert into sales. You can change that by starting a fashion division within Netflix. Enable an interactive option to purchase clothes and accessories that are worn by actors on-screen while watching the shows. Tap into NFT Market: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) i.e., Digital collectibles are the next big thing for companies in the entertainment industry. Recently, an artist Michael Joseph Winkelmann sold a video clip for $67,000 as an NFT, later re-sold for 6.6 million dollars. People have spent more than 230$ million dollars buying and selling NFTs of NBA highlights. Netflix can create and sell NFTs of iconic moments, short clips from Netflix Originals.

Frameworks and methods used for market analysis.

Proter’s five forces

Competition in the industry: The success of Netflix has attracted global giants like Amazon, Apple, Disney. Every regional production house or broadcast network is having a digital transformation and entering the streaming space. As Netflix offers a library of films and TV series through distribution deals, most of the content on the platform will disappear as contracts expire. Global competitors like Amazon, Apple, Disney have deep pockets and support from their umbrella companies that lets them offer services at a discounted price. Regional production & broadcast companies have advantages of content they have been producing for 50+ years and the customer royalty that comes along. Threats of new entrants: Regional production companies are emerging in the market by leveraging their age-old content and targeting their niche customer groups. As they already hold the broadcast licenses or the original movie rights, these production houses and broadcast networks don’t spend much on acquiring content. For example, India’s video streaming market is growing to $5 Billion from $500 million in the next 2 years, primarily because of new players entering the streaming industry. Threats of Substitutes: YouTube is launching its own live stream platform (YouTube TV) in the U.S and worldwide by 2026. IPTV (Internet protocol television) is a new way of watching old-school TV channels. It uses the internet to search any kind of video content and streams directly on your TV or smartphone allowing customers to view, pause & record live tv, sports, regional movies, and tv shows throughout the world. Currently, IPTV is offering a service to start your own OTT platform with inbuilt IT infrastructure. It already gained a 17.8% market share of the entertainment industry and is experiencing accelerated growth. Power of Customers: Customers can choose from a lot of options and with Gen-Z being more tech-savvy, people are finding ways to download free content from the internet. Power of Suppliers: The market is in a unique growth phase where artists are getting an opportunity to produce video content that can be streamed globally on every platform. The cost of production and acquiring new content keeps increasing with artists, production houses starting their own streaming services.

ML Optimisation for Portfolio Allocation,"Authors: Darius Oh (Tech Lead), Mayve Chua, Luke Lau, Sng Hao Jun, Jamais Ang, Kexin Wang, Jacob Pang

Introduction

Portfolio Optimisation is the process of selecting the best portfolio, or rather the best set of possible weights for a basket of assets, given some sort of objective function. Common objective functions include maximising returns, minimising risk, maximising return-risk ratio or minimising tail risk.

The aim of our study is to understand deeper into how Machine Learning can be used to tackle such a complex asset allocation problem, and potentially devise a quantitative strategy that exceeds traditional methods.

The most common strategy that comes to mind when we talk about Portfolio Optimisation would be Markowitz’s Mean-Variance Optimisation. It aims to maximise portfolio returns while minimising portfolio risk, or rather the portfolio’s volatility. For example, investing in two separate negatively correlated stocks instead of a single stock is likely to reduce the risk, or in this case the volatility, of the portfolio. Such an action can also potentially generate greater returns even with the reduced risk. However, Markowitz’s model requires the forecasted portfolio return and volatility as an input to the model. Instead of a simple moving average forecast, we see an opportunity to use Machine Learning to gather a more accurate forecast of the future expected portfolio returns and volatility. With the assumption that the underlying theory of Mean-Variance Optimisation works, we would then be able to come up with an optimal portfolio. This strategy would, hence, combine more advanced Machine Learning techniques with traditional financial theory.

On top of this, we also wanted to explore a second approach to Portfolio Optimization through a pure Machine Learning strategy. This would allow us to come up with a new strategy that is independent of the reliance of traditional financial theory. Recently, much focus has been placed on Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Portfolio Optimisation, as it is able to handle the complex sequential decision-making process. Hence, we wish to explore building our own Reinforcement Learning model to handle the dynamic optimization process and maximise portfolio returns.

Dataset Used

Our models will be trained purely with historical OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) price data. This means that it would not account for changes in the macroeconomic environment such as Interest Rates or Inflation. We collected the historical price data from the year of 2001 until the year of 2019 using yfinance Python API. We excluded earlier time periods as we believe that the price signals in the market performed much more differently as compared to more recent times.

Our stock universe would be the constituent stocks under the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJI) as of 29 August 2021, excluding stocks listed after 2001 due to the lack of data. We chose DJI as it would provide us with a small enough stock universe that can cover a diverse array of industries. In addition, we would also be able to benchmark our portfolio performance against the performance of the index over time. This eventually left us with 27 stocks in our stock universe, coming from various fields of industry.

Approach 1: Mean-Variance Optimization

Asset Returns Forecast Model

Motivation

To support Markowitz’s model for portfolio optimization, we aim to explore using machine learning models to forecast the returns for each of the 27 chosen stocks. In which, our team has narrowed down to three more popular stock predictive machine learning models namely Decision Tree, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) to kickstart our exploration. Our team has chosen to explore LSTM and ARIMA as it has proven to support time-series prediction well. On the other hand, we have also chosen a decision tree as our team is interested in exploring the performance of a regression tree in the context of price prediction.

Model Exploration

All three models will predict for the target variable, log returns (generated using the adjusted close prices) of each stock ticker and the performance of each model will be compared and evaluated using mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE). Adjusted close price is used for determining the log returns as it is more comprehensive and takes into account dividends, stock splits and factors that happen after the market closes.

For the Decision tree model, our team used Adjusted Close Price and Volume as input variables to predict for the log returns of each ticker. Meanwhile for LSTM and ARIMA, for every 50 time steps in the historical log returns dataset of each ticker, our team will utilize the log returns in these time steps as training data to predict for the next time step (testing data). Relative Strength Index (RSI) was also included. After training our model, we evaluated the performance of the model, and the results are shown in the result table below.

Table 1: RMSE and MSE of models

From the results, it can be seen that the decision tree model performed the best as it has the lowest RMSE and MSE. However, this is because the training data contain Adjusted Close Prices which is used to calculate the target variable, log returns and hence the model trained can be said to be biased and the results are overfitted. This is undesirable as the model may not be able to perform as well when fitted with unseen data. However, our team could not fit the training data of LSTM and ARIMA to the decision tree as the decision tree is unable to support the ratio of having many of the same input variables to 1 target variable (1: n) like that of LSTM and ARIMA. Hence, it can be concluded that the decision could only support 1:1 training data making it unable to support the context of our project. As such, despite the decision tree performing the best, our team has decided not to move forward with this model.

On the other hand, it can be seen that the ARIMA model performed the worst. Theoretically speaking, this could be due to the fact that ARIMA is powered by linear regression and hence it assumes that the time series training data being fed is stationary. This means that ARIMA assumes that the training data has no seasonality and has a constant mean, variance and covariance over time. This would thus not support the prediction well as the training data used in this project are long-term (at least 15 years) and contain seasonality in the data itself. As such, it can be said that the ARIMA model is more suited for prediction of short-term time-series data where there is no seasonality as compared to long-term dataset where there exists seasonality. With that, our team has also decided not to move forward with this model.

Therefore, we have decided to move forward with the LSTM model as it is able to handle seasonality in data which the ARIMA model cannot handle as well as handle 1: n training data which the decision tree model cannot handle.

Hyperparameter tuning for LSTM

To further improve on our chosen model, our team has decided to perform hyperparameter tuning to our LSTM model by tuning the learning rate, number of dropout layers and the number of neurons in the first layer. Tuning the learning model will allow the model to be more efficient as it controls how quickly the model can converge to a local minima. On the other hand, tuning the number of dropout layers and the number of neurons in the first layer will improve the performance of the model as it prevents the model from being under or overfitted. To do so, Keras in-built hyper tuner was used to tune the learning rate and number of neurons.

Evaluation Results for LSTM (Apple Ticker)

With that, our team has used the LSTM model to predict for the log returns of each ticker and the actual vs predicted result of the model when predicting Apple stock can be seen in the figure below.

Figure 1: Actual vs Predicted Result of Apple Ticker using LSTM model

Limitations and Further improvements

Due to the limitation of time, our team kept our maximum epochs to 10 to reduce training time which could compromise the performance of our model. This is because the number of epochs is related to the number of rounds of optimization that are applied during training and hence with more epochs, the error on training data will reduce which will in turn improve performance of the model. Thus, it can be said that by limiting the maximum number of epochs to 10 can result in a non-optimal number of rounds of optimization and thus a less optimal performance LSTM model being trained. Having said that, a room for improvement would be to tune the number of epochs when training the model so as to further improve the performance of our model. Furthermore, we can look into using a bi-directional LSTM which has been shown to be able to capture additional features from the data which is not able to be captured by a unidirectional LSTM.

Considering the scope of our project, a more in-depth time series analysis could be completed to further improve the final performance of our model. By analysing and accounting for possible seasonality present in the various time series of the stock prices, it would be easier for the neutral network to learn and hence potentially achieve better performance and more accurate results. For example, to get the model to learn the seasonality of the data, we can use the difference (P(t +1) -P(t)) as the input feature instead, this would allow the generation of a leading model and at the same time prevent the model from having to solely reference yesterday’s price, effectively mitigating the problem of a lagging model.

Going beyond the scope of our project, future work could look into including qualitative data to improve the robustness of our overall model. Sentiment analysis done on diverse data sources such as tweets, news articles, company reports and financial statements could also be included and combined into the deep learning model using feature engineering techniques. By doing so, there is a high potential to develop a more comprehensive prediction system that considers both quantitative and qualitative data.

Asset Covariance Forecast Model

Motivation

The covariance matrix is the other essential input for portfolio optimisation. In order to formulate a predicted rolling covariance matrix, we had to explore how to develop a predicted rolling volatility and rolling correlation matrix. Since a rolling correlation matrix is easily generated, the difficulty here was mainly exploring a logical way to predict rolling volatility.

Harry Markowitz in Portfolio Selection paper (1952) introduces the concept of volatility. Volatility of a portfolio is the standard deviation of the returns of this portfolio. This concept continues to be used in financial markets to define uncertainty/risk. However, most allocation and option pricing models assume that volatilities are constant through time. This assumption is flawed in that volatility clustering is observable in practice: periods of low volatility tend to be followed by periods of low volatility and periods of high volatility tend to be followed by periods of high volatility.

Volatility clustering represents a challenge being an example of heteroskedasticity. In order to alleviate this, Engle (1982) proposed the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH model). Then, Bollerslev (1986) built upon Engle’s model and published his General Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH model).

Thus, we decided to train a GARCH model to predict future volatility as this would address volatility clustering. We create a methodology that enables the estimation of a GARCH model while using the most robust parameters.

Model Exploration

Bollerslev (1986) proposes an extension of the previous model, in which he adds an MA (moving average) part to the equation:

Such a process is written GARCH (p, q). β is a new vector of weights deriving from the underlying MA process, we now have γ + ∑α +∑β = 1. For example, a GARCH(1,1) process has p = 1 and q = 1. It can be written as:

In order to estimate ω, α and β, we usually use the maximum likelihood estimation method. In this case, it consists of maximizing:

In our exercise, we tested GARCH models with parameters p=1 to 5 and q=1 to 5, resulting in 25 possible combinations of p’s and q’s on each of the assets. In order to not overfit the GARCH model, we selected the model that is able to do well in the scoring metrics across all assets.

Evaluation Results

In order to select the set of hyperparameters that are optimized for the smallest extent of errors, we first chose 3 common error metrics — Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in our GARCH modelling analyses performed on each of the 30 assets in our portfolio.

Figure 2: Results of GARCH Modelling using MSE, RMSE and MAE

As the GARCH modelling may possibly yield differing sets of hyperparameters p and q for each asset in the portfolio, we explored a naïve way of taking the mean of the values of p and q across all 30 assets in the portfolio for each error metric. As seen in the figure above, all 3 error metrics return the same set of mean hyperparameters (p = 3, q = 5).

Following this, we used p = 3 and q = 5 as inputs for our hyperparameters in the GARCH modelling to obtain the predicted volatility values which would then allow us to derive the rolling volatility values.

Figure 3: Covariance Matrix of our Portfolio (showing only 10/30 assets)

Together with the rolling correlation values, the covariance matrix can then be calculated.

Limitations & Further improvements

Naïve Mean method

The method of taking the average of the hyperparameters across all the assets of the portfolio may bring about inaccuracies in the GARCH modelling as the hyperparameters p and q represent the extent of which the past values have an influence on the current value. Taking the average of p and q across assets is essentially implying that — if I have a portfolio of 2 assets where it is optimal to take the past x and y values to derive their current respective values, I can proceed to take the past (average of x and y) values to derive the current values for both assets in the portfolio. This is a naïve method as it banks on the assumption that the extent of errors that result from each asset is the same for all assets in the portfolio, which is not necessarily true in reality.

An alternative way that can be explored in future to obtain values p and q might involve running the GARCH modelling on the portfolio returns instead of on individual assets. For example, we can first aggregate across all 30 assets in the portfolio to obtain portfolio returns values at each timepoint. Thereafter, we can run the GARCH modelling on the portfolio to observe what sets of values of p and q are returned with the lowest error values using the same 3 error metrics as illustrated above. This set of values of p and q may arguably represent more accurately the extent of which past values have an influence on the current value.

Optimization

Model Implementation

Having obtained the forecasted daily asset returns from the LSTM model as well as the forecasted daily asset covariance from the GARCH model, we are now able to use these data as input for mean-variance optimisation. We make use of the PyPortfolioOpt Python Library which helps us to perform such optimisations efficiently.

Figure 4: Efficient Frontier Plot using 20000 randomly generated weights

The efficient frontier line is the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. Portfolios above the line are unattainable regardless of the asset allocation, while portfolios below the line are attainable but are less optimal. In order to decide on which optimal portfolio on the efficient frontier to choose, we have to fix an objective function for the optimisation. This could be maximising return-risk ratio, minimising volatility, maximising return with a risk constraint or minimising volatility with a returns target.

For each trading day, we will generate the Efficient Frontier using the current day’s forecasted returns and forecasted covariance. Based on the objective function that we set, we will obtain an optimal portfolio allocation that optimizes for the objective function. This would then give us the weights to hold for each asset for the day. This implies that there will be a rebalancing of the portfolio at the start of each trading day.

In this study, we will be exploring maximising return-risk ratio as well as maximising return with a given risk constraint. This will be further discussed in the Performance Comparison section.

Limitations

The key limitation of the mean-variance optimization strategy is its assumption that returns follow a normal distribution. However, this may not be applicable to some assets which display skewness in the returns data. Since the variability below and above is no longer the same (i.e. downside variance could be much greater than upside variance), it would now make more sense for an investor to work towards minimising downside variance rather than the portfolio variance as a whole. A research paper by Andrea Rigamonti discusses this more elaborately, and pushes for a new strategy known as mean-semivariance strategy. Semivariance is similar to variance, but it only accounts for observations below the mean. This potentially makes it a more useful measure of portfolio risk, especially when returns are not normally distributed.

Another key limitation of our optimisation strategy is that it is not extendable to other assets outside of our stock universe. As we are training the machine learning forecast models specific to only the 27 assets of interest, we would not be able to use the same models to forecast the data for other assets which can exhibit very different behaviours.

Approach 2: Reinforcement Learning

Brief Overview

Reinforcement Learning is an area in machine learning where we train an agent to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error. Given a specific situation or environment, the agent would be able to make the best possible decision to take that can result in the maximum reward attained. In the context of our problem statement, our agent would be making decisions on what stocks our portfolio should hold on each trading day in order to maximise the final cumulative portfolio returns.

Environment

For every step in each episode, the Environment supplies an observation to the Agent, accepts the corresponding action,

which represents the portfolio weights to adopt prior to open, and executes the interactions between the internal portfolio state and the changes in the financial market. Transaction costs of 0.2% were applied on the transition of weights from the prior close, wt-1 to, at to simulate actual trading. Using the vector of assets’ returns rt, the relative portfolio weights at close is then given by

The effective portfolio return (with respect to the prior close) for the step is equivalent to

. Since the rewards are additively accumulated across the episodes, applying logarithm enables geometric returns to be captured in the rewards. For the purposes of setting a common basis for comparison across episodes starting from different dates, the return relative to a benchmark return rate, bt is used as a measurement for the reward ut. S&P 500 was used as the benchmark for this project.

The observations were comprised of the following features, separated into components:

a. Asset prices, returns, expected returns for the previous 20 days.

b. Asset covariance based on the previous 180 days, naive markowitz tangent portfolio weights, and the prior close portfolio weights.

Agent

In order to work with the continuous space of the action required (portfolio weights), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) was used for the RL agent. A custom actor network was used, consisting of a convolutional asset scoring network and secondary dense network. The first component of the observations is fed into the asset scoring network, on an individual asset basis, to obtain an asset score. The asset scores, along with the second component of the observations are then fed into the secondary network to obtain the action. This design prevents the network from overfitting on underlying asset-specific trends which therefore trades some performance for ability to generalize outside the sample.

Actor Network Architecture

Evaluation Results

The results for the k-fold validation are as shown for the model after 50 episodes of training and 100 episodes of training. With the exception of 2020, the model with 100 episodes of training performs better as compared to the model with 50 episodes of training. The models generally outperform the benchmark during stable periods, but underperform during the recovery periods post-shocks.

Limitations

As deep RL requires extensive training and computation, time and investment into the project poses as the primary limitation, which is constrained further by applying k-fold validation. As each action influences the environment state, a permutation of sequences of actions over the same episode provides different training to the agent. In the context of the portfolio optimization problem, where the initial state already varies based on the starting date, it is improbable for an agent trained on 50 or 100 episodes to have covered sufficient exposure. We expect that given sufficient time, the RL model can perform better.

Performance Comparison

Portfolio Performance Results

Our portfolios are generated via three methods —

● Baseline: Mean-Variance Optimisation using rolling average of past returns as forecast

● ML: Mean-Variance Optimisation using forecasts from LSTM and GARCH

● RL: Reinforcement Learning

We include the Baseline portfolio as a comparison to observe the advantages that Machine Learning can bring as compared to a much simpler strategy. In addition, both the Baseline & ML are optimized to maximise return-risk ratio.

Additionally, we decided to filter away the portfolio performance past 2020 for this analysis because our Machine Learning Models have not been able to provide reliable forecasts during periods of unforeseen market shock.

Figure 5: Cumulative Returns of portfolios

Table 2: Summary Statistics of portfolios

From the table above, we can first see that our RL portfolio performs significantly worse than the other two portfolios. It has the lowest annualized returns as well as the lowest return/risk ratio as well. The potential reason for this poor performance has been discussed under Limitations in the previous section.

When comparing the Baseline portfolio against the ML portfolio, we can see that the ML portfolio has a much higher return/risk ratio. While it does have a slightly lower annualized return, it has a significantly lower annualized volatility in comparison to the baseline portfolio. This means that while both portfolios can attain a similar yield, the ML portfolio is able to provide us with a less risky option as compared to the Baseline portfolio. We also wish to explore the flip side where we fix a risk constraint for both portfolios and aim to maximise returns given the same set of constraints.

Figure 6: Cumulative Returns of portfolios

Table 3: Summary Statistics of portfolios

From the table above, we can now see that in order to adhere to the risk constraints, the Baseline Portfolio has a reduced Annualized Volatility together with a reduced Annualized Returns. In contrast, our ML Portfolio is able to take up slightly more risk but has resulted in a significant increase in Annualized Returns. With this objective function, our ML Portfolio achieves a significant higher yield for a similar risk level as compared to the Baseline Portfolio.

Further Discussions

It is useful to note that when we changed our objective function from maximising return/risk ratio to maximising returns, it actually resulted in an increase in the return/risk ratio of the portfolio. This is very unexpected as it means that the ML portfolio generated when maximising return/risk ratio is still not optimal. The reason for this is because we optimize for the objective function using forecasted data. However, due to our forecasts not being able to follow closely enough to the actual numbers, our “forecasted optimal” portfolio will not be able to match the “actual optimal” portfolio.

However, we can see that for the optimisation of the two different objective functions, using the forecasts from our Machine Learning models has proved to achieve better portfolio performance as compared to using a naive method.

Conclusion

From this study, we can observe the potential advantages of using more advanced Machine Learning techniques to make investment decisions. While there has been much skepticism and distrust due to the black-box nature of these techniques, it is without a doubt that many investors and institutions are moving towards such strategies due to the upsides that it brings. Whether it is to complement an existing traditional strategy or to devise an entirely new strategy, Machine Learning is definitely the area that the quantitative finance industry is moving towards and increasingly placing emphasis on.

Bull market, blow off top, bear market. What will happen and how to prepare.

Some notes: These are observations connecting the unfolding of recent and future events and how to best prepare for the next year. NFA



Even though I am long term very bullish for the Crypto & Web3 space as a whole, it is important to remember that all markets enter cycles — especially young markets. For those reasons, I believe there may be more volatility this year (yes, more volatile than normal for crypto).

Up until now, we have had relatively clear market cycles. With the introduction of ‘big money’, these patterns are changing. This means there are more things to watch out for moving forward.

Illiquid supply in Bitcoin and some On-chain Analysis.



Many people have called this year a bull market. This is not incorrect as we have seen some intense growth in many crypto assets, however, the On-chain data shows a different story — a story of accumulation and price consolidation. Let’s look at the illiquid supply chart and see how this chart has been on a pretty aggressive downtrend. It’s getting to the point where close to 78% of Bitcoin is currently out of circulation, leaving less Bitcoin to be traded. This lack of liquidity can make for volatile movements as only close to 22% of the supply is actually being traded. This means it takes less money to move the price in either direction.

Here we can see how illiquid supply has grown for the past 2 years. Even with the price action we’ve had.

There is a direct relation with how illiquid supply tends to be a precursor to some form of bullish rally. You can find more information on why Illiquid supply matters here.

Here we can see how illiquid supply has grown for the past 2 years. Even with the price action we’ve had.

Moving on, let’s quickly see who has been selling recently and if the market will continue downward. Looking at ‘dormancy’, we can see the average age of the coins that are being spent. In this recent downtrend, most of the coins spent have been young coins. Usually this means whales and ‘smart money’ aren’t spending, rather, recent local top sellers are capitulating.

Furthermore, looking at the Entity-adjusted Dormancy Flow we can see that we have almost reset to the summer lows and are essentially forming another bottom.

Entity-adjusted Dormancy Flow is the ratio of the current market capitalisation and the annualised dormancy value (measured in USD). Entity-adjusted Dormancy Flow can be used to time market lows and assess whether the bull market remains in relatively normal conditions



If we have a look at the full Bitcoin history for the Entity-adjusted Dormancy Flow, we can see that we have only touched this zone in market bottoms.

Furthermore, Supply on Exchanges has been moving off into storage that historically is less willing to sell. This would indicate aggressive accumulation, especially since March 2020. Even though we have seen some moments of profit raking, the overall actions have been of accumulation and supply leaving exchanges.

Ethereum tells a similar story. It has actually had more aggressive withdrawals in the past two years and recently has started to see inflows on exchanges. Typically this would mean intense selling, but given that only about 12% of Ethereum was actually on exchanges, it looks more like the start of a run for it.

We can see that since the March crash, Ethereum has been leaving exchanges — reaching a low of 11.2%. As money flows back, it will historically move into the hands of new adopters who do not understand the value of owning your own keys and will typically leave their new bought Eth (or any crypto) on the exchange.

DXY and the S&P: How this has an effect on the crypto space



Historically when the dollar has struggled, but the stock market has rallied, it has created a perfect combination for Bitcoin to flourish.

If the dollar starts to show weakness here, we could see a short but sweet rally of the investment assets as people look for ways to conserve their wealth and purchasing power. Inflation reached its highest point in 40 years and shows now signs of slowing. That is unless they raise interest rates and find a reason to justify printing money, war… more on that later…

With the S&P marching on and the Dollar not looking pretty, money will flow into assets that have proven to protect purchasing power. Sorry Peter, gold has not kept up with inflation in the past 10 years….

Macro market, how US policy might affect outcomes.

Money printing, Covid, War and regulation.



“The United States printed more money in June than in the first two centuries after its founding. Last month the U.S. budget deficit — $864 billion — was larger than the total debt incurred from 1776 through the end of 1979.”- Pantera Capital

Jul 29, 2020

This is only recently catching up to the US as inflation intensifies and the people in charge scapegoat with supply shortage excuses. Or even worse — boogymen greedy corporate owners hiking up prices out of hate of the general public… Oh Elly…

All of this while still being in the middle of an ongoing pandemic. Yes, the one we have been in for two years now, and for some reason, the COVID case count is at ATH now. I won’t get into that but let’s just say lots of things don’t add up. I’ll mention some of these things: lack of prevention care, excessive use of vaccines (4 doses seems like something didn’t work the first time), arbitrary numbers/counting, oh and the 38 billion in profits from big pharma (a successful new product launch is 1 billion in a year). I won’t add wood to the fire, but more COVID cases tends to mean more justification for government spending.



Note: I feel for all the deaths and am sorry. I deeply thank all first responders.



Pair this with a country that is showing intense divide with each side becoming more extremist, the great hate of democrats and republicans. Historically there has been solved one way: war. Now the US is too woke to enter into a direct war with anyone. However, the United States is set to spend $768 billion next year on the military. This is much more than the year before, but this year the US has already exited Afghanistan and isn’t active in any public conflict.



Up for “democratisation” and country reshaping are Ukraine and Taiwan. Most likely, the US would enter into a proxy war with China and Russia through these 2 fronts. Also “protecting” the South China Sea and its allies in the region. Nothing unites a country more than war and threat of foreign fighters…

More on military spending: Politico Opinion (ignore the crying about not getting what dems want, look at numbers for military). Aljazeera article

I don’t pick sides and am not American. But know the effect that the world’s biggest economy has on the rest of the world. For now.

Finally, interest rate hikes. Most central banks around the world announced no hikes for Q1 of this year fearing it would hamper recovery, and blaming the supply shortage for inflation even though inflation has happened everywhere in the world and debt is reaching pretty extreme levels. Most central banks did mention intentions to start hiking interest rates later in the year.



Once this happens, it can spark a quick selling of on-risk assets as well as a general deleveraging in the market. Big players don’t want to hold onto loans as it isn’t cheap anymore to have outstanding debt. Yes the whole economy runs on debt, but it is all about who ends up holding that bag of debt. As interest rates begin to pick up, the hot potato will begin moving around until the last person gets stuck holding the bag.

Media coverage preparing retail to reenter

A lot has happened this year in Crypto as it has slowly grown, however, most of the retail buyers left after the May crash. Since then, big companies have been spending big amounts of money on ads and branding. I’ll mention a few of the most important ones:

Remember that retail moves slowly. Most of what has been happening this past year will start to take effect this year as retail sees the ads in more spaces. As crypto prices pick up, so will interest.



As much as this can sound bullish, I think it’s more of an exit strategy (pump and dump but in rich people words) before the impending doom of the year ahead.



In a tale as old as time, big money exits on risk assets and purchases war and consumer stocks (stock that will perform regardless of market conditions. i.e food, water, McDonalds, etc.) as a safe heaven — not growth stock. Bye bye Tesla.

DeFi and stablecoins.

Regulation means you should move into decentralised stables. i.e UST, Frax, MIM



Stablecoins have been one of the most debated topics in US policy. I’ll keep it short. US wants control and to make sure the USD stays as the world reserve currency. Good luck. But even then, crypto native users do look for some form of stability in order to sidestep the markets in volatile times. We have seen this year how USDT and USDC can easily be frozen, and because of policy, will most likely require KYC to use in the future (it’s all about control).



In the spirit of Cypher Punks and a free, decentralised economy, I support other solutions.

UST is on the top of my list as it has grown the most this year. I believe this growth will continue and adoption of a decentralised stablecoin in DeFi is only natural.

MIM is another solution. Similar to DAI, MIM is a crypto collateralised stablecoin, however, unlike DAI, MIM uses yield bearing collateral and allows anyone to mint MIM (when it is available).



Lastly, Frax. Frax is the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol. Frax is open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain. Unlike UST, Frax has some backing and is not completely algorithmic. However, Frax has not yet grown as much and in my opinion has the most growth ahead for the year. Keep an eye out for FXS (Frax share token).



This year will most likely be the migration from USDT/USDC to decentralised alternatives. Decentralised finance needs decentralised money.

Bull market, blow off top, bear market. What will happen and how to prepare.



With all that has been explained until this point, this is what it predict (I hate predictions) for the year 2022.



I expect Q1 and possibly Q2 to be part of a blow off top mania phase, mostly due to big money looking to exit pump before interest rate hikes and the impending war.



Events to watch for tops:

— Bitcoin backed ETF announcement is set for February to likely launch in March.

— Interest rate hikes. This is said to be re-evaluated quarterly but most likely will begin in the second half of the year Q3.

— War. This only will be harder to see a clear start, but Russia acting on Ukraine or China getting violent will be clear enough.



Lastly, it is important to monitor exchange inflows to see when big money is starting to move out. Smart money sells into strength — not on the other end as price starts to move down.



We must look for dormancy to start to pick up — this would mean old money is preparing for a move. Next blow off tops tend to have 2–6 weeks of exchange inflows as price continues to rally. So when your aunt asks you how to buy some of those “Crypto coins”, tell her how to but that it’s all NFA and then subsequently exit all positions.



My primary objectives and moves for Q1 will be to deleverage and repay all of my DeFi loans, consolidate my portfolio into stablecoin farming strategies, identify potential out performers for the year and work on short time frames, and focusing on the 4H chart and Daily chart in a paranoid way for the next 2–5 months (this, or forgetting about my holdings for 2–5 years).



Be well.

"Cannabis for Diabetes: You get High, but Your Sugar get Low","Cannabis for Diabetes: You get High, but Your Sugar get Low

Cannabis Sativa green leaves

The medicinal properties of marijuana have been known to men for over 10,000 years. But since the 1930s, this plant has been kept underground in the US. Because cannabis became illegal, fear, crime, and ignorance were associated with cannabis. But of course, as we all know, this is rapidly changing.

California, Massachusetts, Maine, and Nevada all passed measures in November legalizing recreational marijuana. California’s Prop. 64 action allows adults 21 and older to possess up to one ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants in their homes.

Finally, marijuana is getting the scientific community’s attention as many seek medical alternatives. As a result, new studies are appearing in all areas of disease prevention and treatment, such as cancer, seizures, and diabetes, to name a few.

Marijuana appears to have a beneficial influence in controlling blood sugar levels and preventing diabetes.

The relationship between pot and hunger and appetite have been widely known. Commonly known as the “the munchies”

The endocannabinoid system is a group of neuromodulatory lipids and their receptors in the brain, involved in various physiological processes including appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory; it mediates the psychoactive effects of cannabis inside our body. If pot increases appetite, how can that be good for diabetes? Even though pot is associated with an increase caloric intake it is also associated with a lower body mass index (BMI), lower obesity and diabetes, but why? New studies are beginning to investigate this.

Recent studies

The first study investigates the benefits of Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) a neutral CB1 in obese rodents. The administration of THCV in obese mice and the subsequent improvement in metabolic functions in these rodents. THCV were found to improve fasting plasma glucose and glucose tolerance when given twice daily, improving insulin sensitivity.

An increased energy expenditure were also noted in obese mouse. THCV was also found to reduce liver triglyceride levels. In another study the use of Rimonabant or CB1 was tested in humans. For one year under the CB1 therapy was reported a 4.7 Kg or greater mean weight loss then the placebo mice group. The treatment also showed beneficial action on metabolic risk factors with an increase in HDL cholesterol (the good one) and a decrease in triglycerides (fat in the blood).

In yet another study seeking to determine the association between diabetes mellitus and marijuana use had a total sample of 10,896 adults including groups of non-marijuana users; past marijuana users; light users and heavy current users.

The results indicated that marijuana users had a lower age-adjusted prevalence of DM compared to non-marijuana users. The prevalence of elevated C reactive protein was significantly higher in non marijuana users (C reactive protein is involved with inflammation therefore having that around is not a good thing). This discovery pointed to the anti-inflammatory properties of marijuana. The study also found that there could be a relationship between early exposure to marijuana and deterrence in the development of diabetes. This study also review other studies performed in rodents where significant benefits against diabetic complications and atherosclerosis were noted in addition to the anti-inflammatory properties. It was also found that CB’s (the non-psychoactive cannabidiol was also found to attenuate the progression of DM type I in rodents.

The limitation of this study (the first one mentioned) were its cross-sectional nature. Persons attending the study may not have represented the larger sample of the population overall. Other limitations were the self-report format which is subject to bias and not always possible to be confirmed.

So what should you do?

So with so much evidence on the benefits of marijuana should you fire up that bowl yet? Not so fast, Even though the medicinal properties of marijuana have been known for a long time we are just discovering how they works. Many are reporting successes of marijuana therapy in various front lines of disease fighting but there are still many questions answered and methodology have not been yet refined.

Marijuana potency have been increasing as growers develop new planting techniques and dosages vary widely and the properties of certain plants are now being studied. We may know the proven benefits in laboratory studies but nothing have been yet tested on populations during a long time period. Unfortunately the therapies available are still being developed and because of the its illegal status in most of the world marijuana have been kept out of the hands of health care systems and professionals capable of delivering safe and effective care except for a few brave ones who goes against the grain in order to find new cures.

Managing Diabetes: 10 Healthy Eating Tips,"Managing Diabetes: 10 Healthy Eating Tips

by Gabriella

When we consider the diverse spectrum of diabetes, no two people affected by the condition are the same. Everyone is not in the same boat when it comes to diets because they have to be adjusted to a person’s specific needs. With this in mind, I’ve done my due-diligence and put together some awesome tips for you to make healthier food choices and decisions.

My recommendations are based on studies involving persons with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These ideas may be useful if you have a different form of diabetes, such as gestational, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, or MODY. It’s recommended to see your dietician for counsel, regardless of the type of diabetes you have.

Tip 1. Limit Salt Intake

Limit your salt intake to no more than one teaspoonful (6g). The reason is because many pre-packaged goods already include salt, so study the labels and choose the ones that contain the least amount of salt.

High blood pressure is linked to a higher risk of heart disease and stroke; therefore eating a lot of salt can raise your risk. If you have diabetes, you’re already at a higher risk of developing all of these problems so it is important to take this to mind and limit salt intake.

Tip 2. Consider the Snacks you eat

People advise against snacks, but they are okay as long as you keep in mind what you are eating. Don’t let snacks become bad habits, use them as meals in between.

Instead of crisps, chips, and cookies, pick unsalted almonds, seeds, fruits, and vegetables as a snack. These are healthier alternatives and won’t leave you feeling guilty.

Tip 3. Don’t Leave out Exercise

Exercising and eating healthy go together like peas and carrots. Fitness can assist you in managing your diabetes while also lowering your risk of heart disease. Most importantly, it helps your body efficiently use insulin.

Set a goal to get about 150 minutes of exercise each week. Pretty much find any activity that raises your heart rate and go from their. Setting goals will tremendously help you become a healthier individual.

Tip 4. Get Vitamins and Minerals from Food, Not Supplements.

You don’t need to take supplements if you can get them from the foods you eat. It’s also preferable to receive your nutrients by consuming a variety of foods. This is due to the fact that some supplements can interfere with your prescriptions or exacerbate diabetes problems.

If you chose to take supplements, please keep in mind the risks and speak with your healthcare professional about them. CLICK HERE!!!

Tip 5. Be Careful when drinking Alcohol.

If you chose to drink alcohol, keep in mind that alcohol is very high on the caloric scale. Alcohol can also put you at risk for a hypo if you are not careful.

Alcohol in general is okay to drink, however you have to be safe and consider the consequences. Develop safe habits and change your bad habits so you can work toward your goal of being healthy.

Tip 6. Reduce Added Sugar

Eliminating added sugars will help you maintain a healthy weight and control your blood glucose levels.

Sugary drinks, energy drinks, and fruit juices can all be replaced with water, plain milk, or sugar-free tea and coffee. This is a good start, and also a healthy habit.

Fat is very important because it is a source of energy. However, something very important to consider is the way different fats affect our health.

Unsalted nuts, seeds, avocados, oily salmon, olive oil, rapeseed oil, and sunflower oil are healthier fats. Saturated fats can raise your blood cholesterol levels, increasing your risk of heart disease.

A good thing to do is to make a habit of checking fat section of the food label.

Tip 8. Add more Fruits and Vegetables to your Diet

Eating fruits and vegetables is very healthy indeed, and it’s always a good idea to eat more at meal times and snack on them when you’re hungry. This can assist you in getting the vitamins, minerals, and fiber your body requires on a daily basis to keep you healthy.

Tip 9. Reduce the Amount of Red Meat you eat

If you’re reducing your carbohydrate intake, you may find yourself eating larger servings of meat to keep you satisfied. This is not recommended for red and processed meats such as ham, bacon, and sausage. All of these have been linked to heart disease and cancer.

Tip 10. Choose Better Carbohydrates

Because all carbohydrates affect blood glucose levels, it’s critical to understand which foods include carbohydrates. Choose carbohydrate-rich foods that are low in fat and sodium and keep track of your portion amounts.

I hope it is easier for you to put these tips into action and make healthier choices when it comes to your diet. Also, change your bad habits and be more active to add further value to your diet goals.",https://medium.com/@Ryanjamez/managing-diabetes-10-healthy-eating-tips-396f171c397e,['Ryan James'],2022-01-07 13:55:04.662000+00:00,"['Diabetes', 'Eating', 'Diabetes Solutions', 'Diet', 'Ketogenic Diet']"
5 Tasty Foods That Can Actually Lower Your Blood Sugar,"5 Tasty Foods That Can Actually Lower Your Blood Sugar

With the rising epidemic of obesity and diabetes in the world, it is important to take steps to prevent these serious diseases. Here are some foods that can help to lower and control your blood sugar, if they are added to your diet:

Pickles.

A recent Swedish university study showed that eating pickles or adding vinegar to your meal can reduce your blood sugar levels by up to 50%. In addition to pickles, most anything with acetic acid in it, such as vinegar, has a similar effect. It’s relatively easy to incorporate vinegar into a meal, just use a vinegar based salad dressing on your salad or use it as a dip for vegetables. Pickles and vinegar works by slowing down or stopping the carbohydrates you ate with the meal from breaking down in your stomach, thus it is absorbed slowly, which stops it from being converted to sugar quickly. The effect is not the same if you consume bread and butter type pickles, as those contain sugar.

Almonds.

A recent study testing the effects of almonds on blood sugar had surprising results. People who ate about 2 ounces of almonds after eating a piece of sliced white bread had significantly lower blood sugar than those who did not eat the almonds. The study also showed similar results when testing with mashed potatoes and rice. Almonds are rich in antioxidants and other vitamins and minerals, so they are an excellent addition to anyone’s diet, whether you have blood sugar problems or not.

Sweet Potatoes.

High in fiber and carotenoids, sweet potatoes are also high in antioxidants that have been shown to help your body better respond to insulin. Skip the brown sugar and syrupy canned varieties, however, as they won’t have the same effect.

Flaxseed.

This includes flax seeds and flax oil supplements. Some studies have shown a stabilization of blood sugar levels with supplementation or increased consumption of flax seeds and flax seed oil.

Cinnamon.

A study in Pakistan showed that diabetics who took small does of cinnamon, from just 1/4 teaspoon to 2 teaspoons per day, had their bodies natural insulin production increase. The study also showed beneficial effects on cholesterol.

So, why not try baking some sweet potatoes and don’t forget the cinnamon! While you’re at it, have a big salad with a tasty and tangy dressing of olive oil and vinegar.

The Best Time to Buy a Robot Vacuum

Here are the best robot vacuums for hard floor and pet hair

The top 8 Best Robot Vacuums for Hard floor and Pet hair are below.

1. iLife V3s Pro

The iLife V3s Pro looks like its sibling, the slightly more extensive and more budget-friendly robot vacuum. It’s made from a smooth white plastic with black accents around the sides, making it easier to clean than some other vacuums on today’s market that have rough handles or bristles for sweeping up messes!

Moreover, This 3″ high unit features a raised front lip explicitly designed so you can’t get stuck in places where your cleaner cannot reach; this also helps make sure dirt stays away when being transported back into the home base (just saying).

The budget robot vacuum (low price) point does come at one minor disadvantage-the lack of gold cover over what would otherwise be seen as a pristinely beautiful machine.

The iLife V3s Pro is a versatile cleaner that can handle any surface, no matter how tough. It has an automatic random pattern meaning it might miss spots or get fixated on one area too much for your liking, but this drawback could help ensure all sizes are cleaned thoroughly!

Last but not least, arrow buttons on the included remote guide your V3s Pro back towards the dirt. If you’re okay with providing it with some supervision, this incredible value will serve floors well!

Specifications:

2. iRobot Roomba S9+

The iRobot Roomba s9+ is a hot buy for any family with pets, as it can handle even the most discharged of hair. What sets this machine apart from its competitors? That would be self-emptying Clean Base technology! When your bin gets full, or if you anticipate completing one job and then moving onto another before emptying old dirt/hair into an external wastebasket (which should happen after every time), press down.

The iRobot Roomba robotic vacuum is an incredible invention that does more than pick up dirt. The bin in which you place the hair and dander from your robot will be neatly closed when it’s time to empty all of its contents, making for a much easier cleanup compared with dumping this waste into a regular kitchen garbage can!

But the iRobot Roomba s9+ isn’t just a vacuum. It can be programmed to clean specific areas of your home, such as around the kitchen table, and avoid others.

Furthermore, For this process to work correctly, you will need an app on both devices which communicate via Wi-Fi connection between them; one serving as mobile remote while the other functions similarly but drives itself throughout each room automatically following its navigation map generated by various sensors included within unit’s exterior housing — mainly explicitly meant so we don’t have any more excuses when eyestrain starts kicking into high gear after spending too much time staring at computer screens all day long!

Specifications:

3. Roborock S4 Max

The Roborock S4 Max is an excellent and less expensive robot vacuum option for anyone who wants to clean their home without having an expensive and bulky vacuum. We found that it quickly created accurate maps on our layout, with the ability to store up to four different map settings at once!

It’s able not only one room but also multiple rooms or even an entire level in just seconds — making this lightweight robot perfect if you’re looking after more than yourself alone!. Plus!, each unit can be customized within their app, so as many passes happen during one run (up to three!).

Also, The no-go zones feature means we’ll never have Fido knocking over food bowls again.

4. Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo N8 Pro+

The Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo N8 Pro is a pricey high-end hybrid good robot vacuum that’s capable of mopping and vacuuming your floors while disposing of its dustbin when it’s done.

The M7 Pro with its around design and raised laser sensor on top. It measures 13 inches in diameter, 3+75 tall, not including bristles!

This crowdfunding sensation has 24 sensors to keep you safe from stairs or other obstacles while mapping out your home for optimal cleaning paths that won’t wear down any carpeting whatsoever- all without getting stuck halfway through a room because of one mistakenly coded passageway.

It may seem not very clear at first, but once we break it apart piece by the stunning robot will become clear as day.

Also, Designed with 2,600Pa of suction power and a HEPA filter to remove allergens from your home’s air as well, the $499 Proscenic M7 Robotic Vacuum is an excellent choice for those who need help cleaning.

With remote capabilities or app support on both iOS ( Apple ) AND Android devices alike — you’ll never be without vacuuming again!

Additionally, The powerful motorized brush tool means quick pickups everywhere, including hardwood floors-even in tight corners.

You also have control over boundaries zones, so no-go areas won’t get vacuumed while you’re away or when someone needs their space back! But if all else fails, this little guy offers excellent vacuuming capabilities at a reasonable price point, too — perfect for those looking into starting easy solutions first before investing more money later down the road as they learn what’s best suited towards them.

The heightened laser sensor, which aids this device in navigating and mapping your home, makes it taller than other floor cleaning robots I’ve tested but will still fit under most furniture.

Specifications:

6. Eufy RoboVac X8 Hybrid

With a pet hair removal score of 100%, the Eufy RoboVac X8 Hybrid is one of our top performers for hardwood floor cleaning. It quickly collected all that fur from your floors and only fell short on the carpet by 89%. But don’t let this stop you! The robot vacuum also functions as an effective mop, so no matter what type or size problem we’ve got going here at home — between business trips, etc., just put some water into its patented tank area (which can hold up to 7lbs) then press “mop” mode.

When we put the robot to work, a few areas needed improvement. The mapping experience when dividing rooms and controlling mopping functions proved challenging at first glance, with imperfections in both design elements and functionality so they can be improved upon for future models if necessary!

But if you only need to clean a small space, consider the answers below. This portable vacuum has four levels of suction power and can get set up quickly enough!

Specifications:

7. Shark IQ Robot Self-Empty XL R101AE

The Shark IQ Robot Self-Empty XL R101AE vacuum is the perfect option for those looking to hold onto their investment and keep things clean.

This machine does all of your vacuuming and washing automatically with little maintenance required with just one monthly fee!

The top-selling feature of these robots? They’re virtually flawless in every way-from how quickly they get up dirt off surfaces around your home or office space (less than 10 minutes!), right down t0 ensuring a dustbin full less often than once per month.

With a self-cleaning brush roll, this vacuum is perfect for pet owners. It also has enough power to suck up all of your fur from carpeting!

8. Bissell Spin Wave Wet and Dry Robotic Vacuum

The Bissell Spin wave Wet and Dry robot can both vacuum your floors to make them genuinely shine or scrub the dirt away using an oscillating brush.

Up until now, Bissell’s upright wet and dry vacuums have been great at cleaning up both carpeting and hardwood floors. But the new SpinWave model goes one step further by offering two spinning microfiber pads as well!

It can suck dirt from low pile carpets while also scrubbing away the grime on your higher-end surfaces, so you don’t need to worry about spots showing ever again — make sure not get it too close when cleaning because its suction power isn’t strong enough for deeply rooted problems like this.

Additionally, The Spin Wave measures 12.25 inches in diameter and stands 3.25 tall, a fairly standard size for robot vacuums which makes it one of the more attractive models I’ve seen-

I’m partial to its all-white design because it matches my home decor much better than most robot vacuums out there, with black or blue colors usually associated with them instead of gray like this device does now!

Specifications:

Mops and vacuums

No mapping features or voice control

Works with cleaning solution

The robot got stuck on some furniture in testing

Automatically avoids carpet when mopping

-

Conclusion:

A robot vacuum can be a great way to keep your house clean and free of pet hair, but the best affordable robot vacuum for you will depend on what kind of flooring you have.

For instance, if you have hardwood or tile floors, an upright cleaner with rotating brushes is ideal. If carpeted areas are more prevalent in your home’s layout, get a robotic vacuuming system that has both rotating brush rollers and suction power.

And finally, if you’re looking for something specifically designed to remove pet hairs from furniture and upholstery (a common problem when pets shed), we recommend getting a specialized attachment.

Down to Earth traditional celebration of Diwali season in Goa,"The midterm vacations for the schools in Goa in the second half of October and the first half of November ring in the Diwali festival. As we all know that Diwali is known as the festival of lights and is celebrated by the Hindus all over, in this article let me tour you across Goa to show you that Diwali here is not just a festival of lights but a celebration of a season of traditions for the local agrarian society.

The Goan Hindus celebrate an entire season of Diwali which is not just for a couple of days but lasts for about a fortnight. This season starts on the day of Dhantrayodashi, which is two days prior to the main festival of Diwali. In Goa, this Diwali is known as the Dhakti Diwali (small Diwali) and is celebrated on the Amavasya (new moon), in the holy month of Ashwin of the Hindu Shakya calendar. This is followed by some important celebrations in the immediately following month of Kartika. The Diwali season extends to Dwadashi (the twelfth day of the waxing period of Kartika), the day of the Tulshi Lagna (wedding of the Tulsi, the holy basil plant) known as Vhodli Diwali (big Diwali) here and ends on the Pournima (full moon) night of the holy month of Kartika.

Akashdivo (Diwali lantern)

Dhantrayodashi is the 13th day of the Krishna Paksha (waning period) in the month of Ashwin and is named after Dhanvantari, the Hindu God of medicine and the founder of Ayurveda. As the saying in Sanskrit goes “Arogyam Dhansampada"", which means health is wealth, this day is celebrated by the Goans to pray for the good health of the entire family. It is believed that Lord Yama (the God of Death) comes down to the earth from the Southern direction, on this day to visit his sister Yamuna (the river) and will be staying here for the next five days. Hence the local Hindus, light an oil lamp on the Southside of the house for five/six continuous nights starting from this day of Dhanatrayodashi till the day of the Bhaubhij (festival of brothers). This lamp of oil is lit to appease the Lord Yama and keep him happy so that the entire family is blessed with good health.

The next day of Dhantrayodashi is the Narak Chaturdashi. This is the eve of Amavasya (new moon night) on which Diwali is celebrated. Narak Chaturdashi is celebrated in a unique way in Goa, with a display and a parade of the effigies of the demon Narakasur. It is believed that Narkasur was the son of mother Earth who turned evil and was killed by Lord Krishna on this day. In the main cities of Panaji, Margao, Mapusa, Ponda, Savordem and Vasco and some other towns, special competitions are held for awarding prizes to the best effigy of this demon. The Narkasur effigies are usually made by the youth with the help of the school kids who are on vacation. All of them put in a lot of hard work in making the effigy. It consists of a framework made from bamboo (cane) and stuffed with grass and old newspapers. This is painted and decorated with cloth and costume jewellery to resemble an actual three-dimensional figure which can move mechanically. At these competitions, it is a feast to the eyes to see these moving Narakasur effigies and the reenactment of the scene of its killing by an effigy of Lord Krishna. Afterwards, in the early hours of the next day, the effigy of the demon is burnt and a Diwali lantern known as Akashdivo is lit in the courtyard of every Hindu house to celebrate the victory against Narakasur. Along with the Akashdivo, several pantiyo (earthen lamps) with cotton wicks dipped in oil are lit in the courtyard thus marking the celebration of Diwali, the festival of lights.

The Akashdivo is a traditional lamp that is made out of small bamboo sticks (native cane) tied together to form a framework that is hexagonal in shape and decorated with colourful papers. In the past, the Akashdivo would be lit from inside with an earthen lamp. This has been replaced in modern times with an electric bulb and along with the earthen lamps, the houses are illuminated with colourful, decorative series of tiny LED lights.

On the morning of Diwali day, all the family members have an abhyangsnan (grand bath) after applying Utne (a paste of Sandalwood). This is followed by the breaking of bitter carrita (a small bitter cucumber-like fruit) by the men with their left toe. The juice of this fruit is tasted by all the family members as a gesture of victory of good over evil. After this ritual, the women of the house perform the ovalnim or deeve dhakovop ceremony for all the men in the household, with a plate containing a lighted deevo (lamp), some vermilion, a betel leaf and a betel nut in it. In return for this ritual, the men gift the women some cash.

Then, the entire household enjoys the special meal called Diwalicho faral, consisting of the paanch taranche fov (five dishes made with pounded rice/ poha as the chief ingredient) along with an usal (spicy dish of a white gram). Along with this ambadyanche raite or sasanv (sweet and sour dish of hog plum) or ambadeacho karam (a sweet preparation of hog plum) is served as a part of the faral. Goa is a rice-producing state, hence Diwali is celebrated here with special dishes made from fov (pounded rice). My friend Ms Suvarna Laad from Sanvordem, prepares the traditional paanch taranche fov for Diwali every year. Her faral consists of usal and ambadeacho karam along with the fov cooked in curds (dhanyatle fov), in milk (dudhantle fov), coconut milk (rosache fov), with potatoes ( batat fov) and also fov prepared with jaggery and grated coconut which is known as kaloillele fov. Some households make a dry chewda (roasted snack) of fov or a dry sticky spicy dish known as tikhat fov or tikshe, ladoos (round balls of sweet) and chokreo (spiral-shaped spicy sweets). Diwalicho faral is distributed to the neighbours and friends from other communities or they are invited over at home by the Hindu households to partake the same.

In the same evening of the Amavasya (new moon) or at times on the next evening depending upon the tithi (date) as per the Hindu calendar, a Laxmi puja is performed in all the shops, business establishments and the houses belonging to the Hindu brethren. Laxmi puja is a religious ritual of worship of the Goddess Laxmi (Goddess of wealth) for prosperity and blessings to the business throughout the year. A new book of accounts is opened from this day onwards for maintaining the yearly business accounts in all the shops and establishments. As a part of the prasad (offering to the devotees) of the Laxmipujan, chirmuliyo ( puffed rice) and some sweet candies or sweets made from milk are distributed to all. In our childhood days, we would get to see children going around with cloth bags to all these shops and collecting the chirmuliyo in them. On the next day, these chirmuliyos would be moulded into round ladoos with molten sugarcane jaggery.

On the next day of Diwali, starts the new month of Kartika. The first day of Kartika is known as Padvo in Goa. This is the day when Lord Krishna and the cattle are worshipped by the farming community in Goa. Lord Krishna is considered a friend of the cowherds and the cattle as friends of the farmers since they help them in the various farming activities. For the farmers this being an important day, it starts with cleaning the cowshed and decorating it with marigold flowers and leaves of the mango tree. Then the cattle are rubbed with oil and bathed and cleaned. Their horns are painted and the back is decorated with some special designs. A special circular design on the back of the cattle is drawn with the help of a kotti (half coconut shell) or a human palm dipped in a coloured paste of rice flour. The cattle are fed with polle (a flattened round dosa made from ground rice). A pollo is also tied around the neck of the cattle along with a garland of marigold flowers . They are given rest for the full day as a gesture of thanks for helping the farmer. A miniature model of the cowshed is made from cow dung right next to the Tulsi Vrindavan (a shrine with a basil plant) in the front courtyard. This mini model of the cowshed is decorated with carrita, the small bitter cucumber-like fruit to represent the cattle and the cowherd.

In the village of Murdi / Murdiwaddo in Narvem, Bicholim, on the Padvo day, the locals hold a special outdoor meal beside the normal traditional Padvo celebrations. As told by a close relative Mr Naresh Naique a resident of Murdi, the villagers gather on the outskirts of the village on a hillock known as Barazan and enjoy a traditional outdoor meal. All of them share the special meal of polle (thick dosas of rice) and sumtanche sukhe, a spicy dish cooked with freshwater prawns caught at the village manas (a mini barrage /dam with sluice gates). This tradition has been practised right from ancient times. Most probably this must have been the place, where the village elders met in the past since the name Barazan implies twelve headmen.

In another village of Marcel in Ponda taluka, this day of Padvo is celebrated with a Padvo Rath carried around the village. A family friend Mr Rajendra Prabhu Kholkar whose ancestral house is in Marcel told me that the Padvo Rath (mini chariot) contains the idol of Lord Krishna. This idol on the other days is housed in the local temple of Devki Krishna and the Padvo Rath ceremony is organised by the priest of this temple along with the bhagat (sort of a tribal priest). The Rath is decorated with ghudiyos (flags) and a moon-shaped decoration called abderger with an idol of Lord Hanuman. It is carried by the villagers from door to door accompanied by the beating of the dhol and tashe (traditional musical instruments). The Rath halts at certain chosen houses, one of them being Kholkar’s house as his mother had made a vow about 75 years ago. When it halts in the courtyard of his house, his family members as well as the neighbours worship Lord Krishna and offer peddas (a type of sweet made from milk) to it. The villagers swing the Rath with their hands in tune to the beating of the dhol and this is called Rath nachaita. Mr Kholkar remembers his youthhood days when he himself would perform this action of Rath Nachovop. At the end of the day, the Rath returns back to the temple courtyard. Here the ghudiyos are distributed as blessings of God to the villagers, who keep them in their houses till the next year Padvo, while the abderger and the Hanuman idol are auctioned off. Mr Kholkar informed me about another Rath of Gadvas which is also carried from door to door on this very day in Marcel but this one covers a wider area as compared to the Devki Krishna Rath.

Another ceremony called the dhendlo ceremony is also celebrated on Padvo day by tribals residing in the villages of Ponda and Tiswadi talukas in Goa. Dhendlo consists of a wooden box-like alter in which a picture of Lord Krishna is kept as he himself signifies the dhendlo. This alter is decorated with flowers and carried by a young man balancing it on his head while moving around in the respective village. Traditional musical instruments of dhol and tashe are played as this dhendlo goes from door to door of every Hindu household in the village. The lady of every house washes the feet of the young man carrying the dhendlo and worships Lord Krishna inside the alter. The dhendlo is offered some money, rice and coconuts. The villages of Dongri, Karmali, Adoshim from Tiswadi taluka so also the villages of Betki, Adkon, Bhoma, Savoi Verem, Palsare and Pedde from Ponda taluka have continued with the celebration of this age-old tradition of the dhendlo ceremony.

My friend Ms Shradha Sardesai Kholkar, daughter-in-law of Mr Kholkar recited to me a verse which is sung by the villagers when the dhendlo is being carried around, which is as follows:

Dhe dhendlo, dhendlya Paus shendlo

Dhendlya aiee mhatari

Shelle hun khatali

Dhe dhendlo

Dhendlya paus shendlo.

(When loosely translated it means, dear dhendlo now that the rains (monsoons) have receded and your mother is an old woman, she eats cold and hot food).

The Padvo is followed by the second day of Kartika which is celebrated as Bhaubhij, the festival of brothers. This day is an auspicious day on which the sister performs the ritual of ovalnim of her brother in the evening. Ovalnim is a ritual of waving a plate in front of the brother. The plate contains a lamp-lit with a cotton wick soaked in oil, Haldi kumkum (turmeric and vermilion) and flowers. After the ovalnim, kumkum is applied on the forehead of the brother and he is offered some sweets. Then gifts are exchanged between the siblings. This day is a very special one as it is considered a day of strengthening the bond between a brother and his sister. Hence the married sisters pay a special visit to their brother's house to perform the ovalnim. This is the last night of lighting the Southside facing lamp, which was meant for the appeasement of Lord Yama. It is believed that after Bhaubhij he takes leave of his sister the Yamuna and goes back to his abode.

Meanwhile, the Akashdivo (Diwali lantern) is continued to be lit every evening. The eleventh day of the Shukla Paksha (waxing period of the moon) is the day of Ekadashi. This day is another auspicious day as the savashins (married women) observe a fast till the next day of Dwadashi (twelfth day).On the Ekadashi the Tulsivrindavan locally known as the Tulas, which is a small shrine in the courtyard with the basil planted in it, is cleaned and painted. The savashins perform a mini puja of the Tulas and offer naivedya (an offering to God) of fruits and moongache konn (a sweet dish prepared with jaggery and moong, a type of a lentil). The Dwadashi is the day of the Tulshi Lagna or wedding of the Tulsi. This is a very important festival for all the Goan Hindu community and it is known as the Vhodli Diwali here. On this day, in the late evening, a grand puja of the Tulsi is performed following the Ganesh puja. Then the rituals of a wedding ceremony of the Tulas are conducted. According to the Puranas (ancient holy scriptures of the Hindu religion), it is believed that Lord Vishnu married Tulsi on this day. For conducting the wedding the Tulshivrindavan is decorated like a bride with Tulsi (basil) planted inside it along with dino (Leea indica) to represent the groom and uss (sugarcane) as the dhedo (best man). A branch of chinch (tamarind) is the dhedi (bridesmaid). Soon after the Tulshi Lagna, the savashins light a plate with jodio in front of the Tulsivrindavan praying for a long and healthy married life with their husband. Jodio is a collection of 365 pairs of cotton oil wicks soaked and dipped in oil which are kept burning on a plate till they are charred to ashes. A pair of the oil wicks symbolise the jodi (couple) for each day of the year of 365 days. The dried charred ashes are put in the Tulas. Then the entire family enjoys a meal which is a special Hindu wedding meal that includes a sweet dish of ghodshe. Some of the families actually erect a lagnacho matov (outdoor, open-air wedding canopy) to celebrate the Tulshi Lagna. The Shastras (religious scriptures), allow the Tulshi Lagna to be performed on any day from the Dwadashi till the Purnima of the month of Kartika which is celebrated as Dev Deepawali (Diwali of the Gods), so different households perform it as per their convenience on any of these auspicious days.

On the night of the Kartiki Chaturdashi (a day prior to the day of the full moon), the city of Margao celebrates the well-known festival of Dindi. This festival is celebrated in the form of a grand procession of the Palkhi (palanquin) of Lord Vitthal and Rakhumai (reincarnations of Lord Vishnu and his consort Laxmi). The entire city of Margao comes alive on the night of the Dindi as many programmes of Indian classical singers are held to celebrate the festival.

In the town of Sakhalim in Bicholim taluka, a temple dedicated to Lord Vitthal at Vithalpur celebrates the festival of Tripurari Purnima on the full moon night of Kartika. As this day is also celebrated as Dev Deepawali the devotees of this temple traditionally release lighted lamps in the river. A special boat festival is organised in which miniature models of boats and ships made from decorative materials are illuminated and sailed in the water body next to the temple. Prizes are awarded to the best boats, by the organizers of this mini boat festival.

The celebration of the Tulshi Lagna or the Vhodli Diwali marks the end of the Chaturmas (four months) period which had begun from the Ashadhi Ekadashi the eleventh day of Shukla Paksha (the waxing period of the moon of the holy month of Ashadh). Chaturmas is the holy period of the Hindu religion during which marriages in the community are not allowed to be held as Lord Vishnu (Krishna being his reincarnation) is believed to be taking rest. The marriage season starts only after Lord Vishnu gets married to Tulsi on the day of the Vhodli Diwali. In this year of 2021, the Dhakti Diwali was celebrated on the 4th of November and the Vhodli Diwali/ Tulshi Lagna on the 15th of November all over Goa. This marked the end of Chaturmas of 2021, thus paving the way for the commencement of the marriage ceremonies of the Goan Hindu community and also for the celebration of the various local zatras (temple festivals) that will be held in the temples located all across Goa.",https://medium.com/@larapereiranaik/down-to-earth-traditional-celebration-of-diwali-season-in-goa-d754dc26502e,['Lara Pereira Naik'],2022-01-24 05:58:28.472000+00:00,"['Goa', 'Diwali', 'Festivals']"
